In the clip, Trump talks about terrorism and mentions the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.\n\n\u201cFORMER PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE WAS NO ATTACK ON THE TWIN TOWERS,\" the post reads in Spanish. \"Everyone knew it and knows it, and there is nothing new in this.\"\n\nA similar claim on X, formerly Twitter, was shared more than 2,400 times.\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nOur rating: False\n\nTrump did not say there was no World Trade Center attack. The full video makes it clear he said that kind of attack did not occur during his presidency because of the measures he had implemented.\n\nTrump said that during his presidency there were no attacks like 9/11\n\nThe post shows a clip of Trump\u2019s speech on Jan. 22, the day before New Hampshire's primary. In the full speech, he criticized his biggest competition for the Republican presidential nomination, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Trump said she condemned his border policy, which he said kept the country safe during his presidency.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to stop terror from coming into our country,\" said Trump in the speech. \"But I couldn\u2019t talk about it because I didn\u2019t want to do that and the following day something happens. So I went four years keeping my mouth shut on that particular subject. But now I talk about it all the time. We had no attacks. We didn\u2019t have a World Trade Center.

At no point in his speech does Trump say there had never been an attack on the World Trade Center.\n\nIn fact, Trump has spoken publicly several times about where he was during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. While he was still president in 2019, he delivered remarks on the 18th anniversary of 9/11 and said he was in a building in Midtown Manhattan when he saw the second plane hit the World Trade Center.\n\nBut he has shared different versions of that day, as The Washington Post reported. At times, he has said he was in Trump Tower, four miles from the World Trade Center, and could see people jump from the buildings.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the user who shared the post for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nAFP also debunked the claim.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Several of these squads already suffered upsets this week, but those results might actually increase the urgency for these high-profile showdowns. Rather than attempting to rank the games as we often do in this space, we\u2019ll just present the top five (plus three) in chronological order to help you plan your weekend viewing.\n\nThough it isn\u2019t among the day\u2019s true headliners, the top-ranked and defending national champion Huskies will nevertheless enter a raucous atmosphere in Madison Square Garden. But while the Red Storm have shown progress in Rick Pitino\u2019s first year at the helm, they remain barely on the fringe of the tournament bubble, and Wednesday night\u2019s setback at Xavier didn\u2019t help. The main weapon for St. John\u2019s is center Joel Soriano, a good paint scorer who also has range as far as the three-point arc. He might struggle to find room to operate in close with Donovan Clingan back to provide rim protection for the Huskies.\n\nBRACKETOLOGY: North Carolina barely holding on to top seed\n\nLast March\u2019s national runner-up also gets an early tip time for this key home opportunity against the current Mountain West leader. Both the Aztecs and Aggies are comfortably in the field at this point, but another quality win is always welcome. Utah State does most of its damage from the perimeter, with Darius Brown (6.9 apg) often setting up wing mates Great Osobor and Ian Martinez. The Aztecs might have the edge inside with Jaedon LeDee (20.5 ppg), and he and frontcourt partner Elijah Saunders could take charge on the glass if the Aggies\u2019 treys aren\u2019t falling.\n\nThe Cougars have righted the ship after a couple early road setbacks in their Big 12 debut campaign, while the Jayhawks are in need of a high-end result to demonstrate they are the title contenders they were projected to be at the start of the season. Though Kansas center Hunter Dickinson is a difficult matchup with his size and shooting touch, Houston's relentless pressure could limit his effectiveness. The Cougars can struggle to score in stretches as well, but veteran guard Jamal Shead usually gets the ball where it needs to be.\n\nThis contest was undoubtedly scheduled intentionally on this date for maximum impact, though it rarely fails to deliver regardless. The Tar Heels would deny it, but they might have been peeking ahead a bit in Tuesday night\u2019s surprisingly flat performance at Georgia Tech that snapped their 10-game winning streak. The Blue Devils, who appear to be rounding into form and getting healthier, will obviously have UNC\u2019s attention. Duke\u2019s Tyrese Proctor will look to continue his recent hot streak against the Tar Heels, who were uncharacteristically lax in guarding the arc last time out. UNC will also need a return to form for Harrison Ingram to help against the Blue Devils\u2019 big bodies.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit farther down the rankings, but this Big 12 battle is every bit as important as the one in Allen Field House. The Cyclones look to maintain a share of the league lead and wouldn\u2019t mind another good result to show they aren\u2019t just home-court heroes, while the Bears managed to snap their three-game skid but are still in need of a top-tier conference victory. Two of Baylor\u2019s three league losses were in overtime and the other was by two points in regulation, so it isn\u2019t as though the Bears aren\u2019t close. They have plenty of scoring options but perhaps need to identify the takeover guy in clutch time. That won\u2019t be easy against the Cyclones\u2019 lock-down defense that yields just 61.8 points and forces 18.2 turnovers a game.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s two poll heavyweights were brought down a peg this week as the Volunteers were stifled by South Carolina and the Wildcats failed to close the deal against Florida, both on their respective home floors. Both now seek a needed bounce-back performance that should at minimum keep the winner in the top 10. This might sound unfathomable, but Tennessee might actually like this matchup better than its most recent tangle with the Gamecocks. Kentucky has plenty of firepower but often isn\u2019t nearly as attentive on the defensive end, putting opponents on the free-throw line more than they get there themselves. The Volunteers on the whole defends better as a team, but a hot Antonio Reeves is more than capable of trading shots with Dalton Knecht.\n\nBy now the dedicated viewer might be running out of steam, but if you have anything left in the tank you\u2019ll want to stay awake for this one. Though neither of these long-time West Coast Conference antagonists is currently in the Top 25, this first of two encounters between them is in no way diminished in importance. Both are well-positioned in the NET thanks to challenging themselves in non-league competition, and each is hoping to take advantage of this Quad 1 opportunity to bolster an at-large resume. One of them will need it, after all, since there can be only one automatic qualifier. Gonzaga lacks the consistent perimeter scoring that Zags\u2019 teams of recent vintage could count on, but Nolan Hickman has improved his accuracy of late. The Gaels, heavily reliant on their defense, will need an efficient outing from high-volume shooter Aidan Mahaney to keep the hostile crowd in the Kennel at bay.\n\nThe Badgers entered the week topping the Big Ten standings before a Thursday overtime loss to Nebraska dropped them behind the Boilermakers. Purdue, having narrowly avoided being swept by Northwestern, now look to solidify its position on the top seed line. While their big man in the middle Zach Edey is hard to miss, the Boilermakers\u2019 ability to exert game control often lies with point guard Braden Smith keeping turnovers to a minimum. Wisconsin\u2019s perimeter defense, usually spearheaded by Chucky Hepburn, will try to make entry passes to Edey adventures."}

Who was snubbed?\n\nFunko asked fans about a Jason Kelce figurine\n\nFunko had tested the waters for a possible Jason Kelce figurine earlier this week by posting a drawing of what a possible toy might look like. \"Do you feel this electric atmosphere?! How would you react if we released this Pop! Jason Kelce\u2026\" the Original Funko Pop account asked.\n\nMore than 40,000 liked the post, so apparently the discussions began \u2013 another 2,900 liked a similar post on X. Jason Kelce talked about working with Funko Pop! on a T-shirt with a charitable aspect on he and Travis Kelce's \"New Heights\" podcast on Wednesday.\n\nTo recap Jason Kelce's shenanigans for the Chiefs-Bills playoff game: He hung out with Bills' fans before the game at Highmark Stadium, doing a shot out of a bowling ball.\n\nKelce also lifted up one fan to take a selfie, and another who held a sign for Taylor Swift, so the singer who was also in the booth could see it.\n\n\"I get it. It was a little bit outlandish. I don't know why it happened. It just felt right,\" Kelce said about the celebration on the podcast. \"That's all I can say. It felt like the right thing to do.\"\n\nIt's Funko's first-ever presale of a toy. To celebrate the release of the figurine, Funko will be donating to the Patricia Allen Fund at the Oishei Children\u2019s Hospital in Buffalo. Bills quarterback Josh Allen and his family created the fund in 2020 after the passing of his grandmother Patricia Allen. The hospital has built a Patricia Allen Pediatric Recovery Wing with proceeds from the fund.\n\nThe fund started by Bills fans donating more than $1 million after learning about his grandmother's passing. Fans of other teams including the Chiefs also made donations.\n\nBarbie:Let's go to a Super Bowl party. Mattel has special big game doll planned\n\nJason Kelce's moment resulting in art in Buffalo\n\nThe cultural significance of Kelce's celebration has already been commemorated by a few already.\n\nLJ Rader, who compares sports images with works of art on the Art But Make It Sports social media accounts, likened the act to \"The Feast of Bacchus.\"\n\nCanadian artist and sports fan Samantha Wojciechowicz created her own painting of Jason Kelce celebrating. Born with a rare genetic disorder called ectrodactyly, she has two fingers on each hand. For the Kelce artwork, she used a football to paint the image. Last year, she did a painting of the brothers.\n\nTravis Kelce also has a Funko Pop figurine\n\nFor what it's worth, brother Travis already has been immortalized in figurines by Funko Pop (out of stock but sold on eBay and elsewhere). And last year's Little People Collector Line Super Bowl LVII Champions set featured Super Bowl and regular season MVP QB Patrick Mahomes, tight end Travis Kelce, defensive tackle Chris Jones and a Chiefs super fan.\n\nDepending on how Super Bowl 58 turns out, Kelce could have a repeat as a Little People figurine. Fisher-Price is planning another Little People Collector Super Bowl set ($30) with figurines of three NFL players \u2013 from either the Chiefs or 49ers \u2013 and one \u201csuper fan.\u201d\n\nWho knows, maybe there's another immortal moment coming from Jason Kelce, too.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Local health officials said they were working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to notify passengers who were seated near the person on the flight.\n\nThe California patient is the latest in a spate of recent measles cases around the country that prompted a CDC alert last week to health providers to check for the disease. The highly infectious virus is often caught by young people eligible for the vaccine who did not receive before traveling abroad, the CDC said. Measles cases are also rising globally.\n\nThe virus can cause serious issues and is potentially deadly for people who aren\u2019t vaccinated or immune to it.\n\n\u201cMeasles is spread by air and by direct contact even before you know you have it and can lead to severe disease,\u201d Dr. Muntu Davis, the LA County health officer, said in a statement.\n\nMeasles in 2024:Are you at risk of measles amid outbreaks in pockets of US? What you need to know.\n\nAfter leaving the airport, the infected person then went to a Chick-Fil-A in Northridge, California, between 8 and 10:30 p.m., health officials said. The public health department is continuing to investigate other areas the person visited.\n\nThe initial symptoms, which usually show up a week or two after exposure, include high fever, runny nose and cough, followed by a hyper-pigmented or red-colored rash at the hairline that moves down a person\u2019s body. About one in 1,000 people with measles develop brain swelling, and one to three in every thousand die, according to the CDC.\n\nLA health officials urged anyone in the vicinity of the infected person during the relevant periods to review their immunization and medical records to ensure they received their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. People who are pregnant, have an infant or have a weakened immune system or aren\u2019t immune, should contact their health provider. If symptoms develop, officials said people should stay at home and reach out to a health provider prior to visiting a hospital or clinic, so that officials there are properly prepared.\n\nLA County last saw five measles cases in 2020, and an outbreak of 20 cases in 2019. Most were in people who were not immunized or didn\u2019t know whether they had ever been immunized or previously infected with measles.\n\nA 2021-22 school year report by the state of California found about 96.7% of LA County kindergartners received their full MMR vaccine series. The national coverage for the vaccine among kindergartners was 93.1% in 2022-23, leaving about 250,000 kindergartners at risk of the disease.\n\nEduardo Cuevas covers health and breaking news for USA TODAY.

Pitts, 45, was dispatched to a gas station in the town located 145 miles south of Little Rock to deal with a man causing a disturbance, according to a release from Arkansas State Police. The police agency launched an investigation in November at the request of a district attorney to determine whether Pitts illegally detained the unruly customer, identified as a 49-year-old man.\n\nAfter an arrest warrant was issued, Pitts surrendered himself Tuesday the Chicot County Sheriff\u2019s Office, state police said.\n\nClearwater plane clashOfficials report 'several' fatalities after plane crash at Florida mobile home\n\nChief claims he let man go free\n\nChief Pitts had been called Oct. 26 to the gas station to deal with the unruly customer, who he told investigators he intended to arrest on charges of criminal trespassing, public intoxication and terroristic threatening, according to a probable cause affidavit.\n\nHowever, Pitts said he was unable to take the man to jail because the back seat of his patrol car was temporarily storing a vehicle bumper, investigators said in the affidavit. The logistical challenge, Pitts claimed, prompted him to remove the man's handcuffs, warning him not to return to the gas station.\n\nBut investigators with the Arkansas State Police came to a much more different conclusion of how the interaction transpired. The customer's account, combined with cell phone data, led investigators to determine that Pitts forced the gas station customer into his cruiser before transporting him to a remote location in Chicot County.\n\nInvestigators: Chief warned man he would 'beat his ass'\n\nWhile driving to the remote location, Pitts is accused of telling the man that he was going to \"beat his ass,\" the man told investigators. Once they reached the destination, Pitts is then accused of assaulting the man and leaving him stranded, according to the state police.\n\n\u201cUpon reaching County Road 86, (the man) alleges that Chief Pitts forcibly removed him from the patrol unit and subjected him to a brutal assault, resulting in significant injuries to his face and head,\u201d an Arkansas State Police special agent wrote in a court affidavit obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe man told investigators he had left his hat in Pitts' patrol vehicle, which he found the next day near a dumpster, according to the affidavit.

District Court\u2019s calendar, confirming that his fight over whether he is immune to the charges will delay the case.\n\nThe delay could have a ripple effect on other cases pending against the former president. The change in Washington makes it likely that Trump's first criminal trail will be in New York, where he is charged with falsifying business records on a scheme to pay hush money to an adult film star and a former Playboy mode. That trial tentatively set for March 25.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has said the judge was waiting to see what happened in other jurisdictions. He said in December he would have a better idea of the schedule after the next hearing in the case Feb. 15.\n\nIn the federal case in Washington, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan set the tentative trial date in August, weeks after the former president was indicted on three conspiracy charges and one obstruction charge.\n\nBut the case has dropped off the D.C. District Court\u2019s calendar and hasn\u2019t been rescheduled before the November election. Chutkan hasn't explained the change in the court docket.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nDelay stems from fight over whether Trump is immune to charges\n\nTrump, the likely Republican presidential nominee, has sought to delay four criminal cases until after the election. He has also argued he is immune to the federal election charges because he was president when the alleged criminality took place.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is considering his argument and the decision has no deadline, but could come at any time.\n\nWhatever the decision, the case is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court, which could take weeks or months longer to decide.\n\nChutkan had sought to stick to her schedule. But other issues must also be debated before trial, such as what evidence might be excluded and what questions will be asked of potential jurors.\n\nShe had said postponing those decisions \u201cwill not serve the interests of justice.\u201d\n\nHow does the delay in one of Trump's trials affect the others?\n\nThe delay in the federal trial, which is expected to last six weeks, could have a domino effect on the other criminal cases pending against Trump.\n\nThe delay might provide an opening for a New York trial on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments before the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNew York Justice Juan Merchan tentatively set the trial to start March 25. A hearing is scheduled Feb. 15.\n\nIn December, Bragg declined to predict the timing of the case. He said the judge was right to wait to see what happened in other jurisdictions.\n\n\"We have not forgotten about it,\" Bragg said. \"We are at the ready with our team that's got more than 100 years of experience working.\"\n\nTrump's lawyer in the case, Susan Necheles, didn't immediately responded to a request for comment about the trial date.\n\nDepending on the length of the Washington trial\u2019s delay, and when the New York trial is held, Trump\u2019s federal trial in Florida on charges he hoarded national security documents after leaving the White House could also be postponed.\n\nThe documents trial is tentatively scheduled May 20. But prosecutors and defense lawyers are still arguing about how to handle classified documents in that case.\n\nA Georgia trial on charges Trump and others conspired to interfere with the 2020 election hasn\u2019t been scheduled yet.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has asked for an Aug. 5 trial date. But that would mean the expected five month trial could overlap with the election.\n\nFulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee hasn\u2019t set a date yet.\n\nAfter one of Trump\u2019s co-defendants, Mike Roman, complained about Willis\u2019 relationship with one of her prosecutors, McAfee set a hearing Feb. 15 to determine whether the accusation will upend the prosecution of the case. Willis is set to file a written response to the charges Friday."}

He rejected extended pauses in fighting and stressed a complete stop in Israel's military siege as well as increased aid and terms of Gaza's reconstruction.\n\nBut speaking on Tuesday at a religious academy in the occupied West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue the war until Israel secured \"absolute victory\" over Hamas.\n\n\u201cWe will not withdraw the Israeli military from the Gaza Strip and we will not release thousands of terrorists,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nOver 100 hostages were released from Gaza in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners during a weeklong cease-fire in November. Only one hostage has been rescued since Hamas' deadly attack on communities along Israel's southern border sparked the war; Hamas says several have been killed in airstrikes. In December, Israeli troops mistakenly shot and killed three Israeli hostages in Gaza who soldiers misidentified as threats.\n\nMore than 27,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry said on Thursday. The Health Ministry said most of those killed were women and children; it does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths. Israel has said its military has killed thousands of Hamas militants.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n\u220e The Israeli military said on Friday it successfully intercepted a missile that approached the country from the Red Sea.\n\n\u220e Ebrahim Raisi, the president of Iran, said in a televised speech that while Iran will not start a war, it will \"respond strongly\" to \"an oppressive country or force (that) wants to bully us,\" CNN reported.\n\n\u220e Israel's military continued intensive military operations throughout Gaza on Friday. On X, the military said it killed 20 militants in Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza, and attacked Hamas infrastructure in central and northern parts of the territory.\n\n\u220e The Palestinian Red Crescent Society, an independent aid group, said Israeli troops killed several displaced civilians and injured several others at the organization's building in Khan Younis. The Israeli military has not responded to the accusation.\n\nUS attacks on Houthi combat assets in Yemen continue\n\nThe U.S. military continued attacks on combat assets in parts of Yemen controlled by the Houthis, a rebel group that's targeted Navy and commercial ships in the Red Sea since December.\n\nThree strikes were carried out on Friday by U.S. and British forces in the northern Yemeni province of Hajjah, the Associated Press reported, citing Al-Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel.\n\nLate Thursday, U.S. Central Command said it fought off a Houthi drone over the Gulf of Aden and an explosive sea drone heading toward the international shipping lane in the Red Sea. Two Houthi missiles that appeared aimed at a cargo ship missed the mark and fell in the water, CENTCOM said in a social media posting.\n\nThe Houthis began their missile and drone campaign on Red Sea shipping lanes in mid-November, forcing cargo vessels to seek other routes and raising the cost of shipping. The Houthis say the attacks are meant to show solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, ravaged by the Israeli military retaliation to the Oct. 7 Hamas assaults.\n\nIran-backed militia says it will not stop targeting US forces in Iraq\n\nAn Iran-backed militia in Iraq said it will continue targeting American troops in the Middle East, even after a powerful pro-Iran group announced a temporary suspension of its military operations against the U.S.\n\nAkram al-Kaabi, leader of the Harakat al-Nujaba militia, said Friday the group he leads will continue attacks against U.S. forces until troops withdraw from Iraq and Israel ceases its offensive in Gaza.\n\nEarlier this week, Abu Hussein Al-Hamidawi, secretary-general of Kataib Hezbollah, said the militia\u2019s fighters would adopt a \u201ctemporary passive defense\" and warned against \"hostile American action.\" His group, also called the Hezbollah Brigades, is the strongest among a collection of Iran-backed militias known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq.\n\nThe White House blames the Islamic Resistance in Iraq for the drone strike on Sunday that killed three U.S. soldiers in Jordan.\n\nIsrael's military turns focus on overcrowded city of Rafah\n\nA top Israeli official said the military will turn the focus of its military in southern Gaza to Rafah, where more than 1 million civilians have sought refuge from bombardment and ground combat.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant wrote on X Thursday that the military \"dismantled\" Hamas' footholds in Khan Younis, another city in southern Gaza, and will \"continue to Rafah.\"\n\nMore than half the population of Gaza has packed into Rafah over the last several months amid an intensifying offensive by Israel's military and orders to evacuate to the south. In recent days, thousands more have arrived.\n\nThose in the overcrowded city are living in makeshift structures, tents or out in the open. Human rights groups have warned about the rampant spread of diseases in Rafah amid a shortage of clean water, food and sewage infrastructure.\n\n\"Rafah is now a pressure cooker of despair,\" Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N. aid coordination office, said on Friday, \"and we fear for what happens next.\u201d\n\nContributing: Associated Press; John Bacon, Jorge L.

Job gains for November and December were revised up by a whopping 126,000, with the December tally upgraded to 333,000 from 216,000. The changes portray a stronger labor market in the fall than previously believed.\n\n\"The revision of last month\u2019s numbers added to today\u2019s report make clear-the economy is breaking new ground,\" says .Jane Oates, president of WorkingNation, a nonprofit that raises awareness about the challenges facing U.S. workers and former head of the Labor Department\u2019s employment and training division.\n\nAre wages catching up to inflation?\n\nAverage hourly pay also rose sharply, climbing 19 cents to $34.55 and pushing up the yearly increase to 4.5% from an upwardly revised 4.3%. Since spring of last year, pay increases have outpaced still-high inflation, giving consumers more purchasing power.\n\nIs the Fed expected to cut rates?\n\nThe blockbuster job and wage gains could make the Federal Reserve warier about cutting interest rates anytime soon. The Fed tentatively plans to lower rates three times this year but said this week that a March cut is unlikely because officials want to ensure a pandemic-related inflation spike has been tamed for the long term.\n\n\"With blowout payrolls, a large upward revision, and a low unemployment rate dreams of imminent Fed rate cuts are likely to be crushed by today's report,\" Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics.\n\nHe doesn't expect the Fed to start reducing rates until the third quarter.\n\nBut other economists are still betting the central bank will act in May. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week that a strong economy and job market can co-exist with easing inflation and would not discourage officials from cutting as long as price increases continue to slow.\n\nSince pay gains feed into inflation, January's rise in wage growth poses concerns. But the Fed will be focused mostly on whether inflation reports over the next few months show a continued slowed, says Nationwide economist Kathy Bostjancic.\n\nWhat sectors are adding the most jobs?\n\nLast month, professional and business services led the job gains with 74,000. Health care added 70,000; retail, 45,000; social assistance, 30,000; and manufacturing, 23,000.\n\nFederal, state and local governments added 36,000 jobs.\n\nIn recent months, industries that are less sensitive to rate increases and the economy\u2019s ups and downs -- such as government, health care, and social assistance \u2013 have accounted for the bulk of U.S. job growth lately. That pattern persisted to some extent last month but job gains were broader based with professional services and manufacturers hiring lots of workers.\n\nHow many hours a week do most Americans work?\n\nOne glaring weakness in the report: The average work week fell to from 34.3 hours to 34.1 hours, lowest since the depths of the pandemic in March 2020. It's unusual for employers to be giving workers fewer hours at the same time they're adding lots of employees.\n\nAt least a partial answer is that companies are still smarting from severe COVID-induced labor shortages over the past two years and are reluctant to let workers go even if their sales are flagging, Bostjancic says. They even may be adding some workers as they eye a pickup in demand down the road.\n\nSince businesses have a surplus of employees, they're giving each fewer hours on average. That could signal slower hiring in the months ahead.\n\nYet economist Lydia Boussour of EY-Parthenon says unusually cold weather last month likely payed a role in the reduced hours.\n\nHow does weather affect employment?\n\nThe January totals were expected to be skewed by some unusual crosscurrents. Cold, snowy weather in the Northeast and Midwest likely dampened employment in industries such as construction and restaurants, Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note. That seemed to play out at least partly, with construction adding a modest 11,000 jobs and restaurants and bars trimming a few thousand.\n\nA further decline was likely because unseasonably warm weather boosted employment in December, setting the stage for a pullback as temperatures returned closer to normal last month, Goldman said.\n\nAt the same time, retailers, hotels and trucking companies brought on fewer holiday workers than usual late last year, prompting fewer layoffs in January and lifting employment on a seasonally adjusted basis. That likely swelled payrolls by about 100,000, Goldman figured, more than offsetting the weather-related hit.\n\nWhat is the hiring projection for 2024?\n\nThe bigger picture is that consumer spending and job growth are likely to slow substantially this year as lower- and middle-income households cope with high interest rates, record credit card debt, still-elevated inflation and dwindling COVID savings.\n\nMoody\u2019s Analytics expects the U.S. to add an average of 72,000 jobs a month, down from 255,000 last year and 399,000 in 2022, as a post-pandemic burst in pent-up spending fades further.\n\nWill there be layoffs in 2024?\n\nBig Tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google have announced thousands of layoffs recently and some economists continue to predict a mild recession in 2024.\n\nBut most forecasters believe the nation will avoid a downturn. The same tech giants that are cutting workers in gaming and streaming are beefing up staffs for artificial intelligence and machine learning, says Ger Doyle, senior vice president of Experis, the tech hiring arm of staffing firm ManpowerGroup."}

World Heavyweight Champ Seth Freakin' Rollins has made it known that he wants Rhodes to challenge him. However, the opportunity to take down Universal Champion Roman Reigns may be too much for Rhodes to pass up. Rhodes already lost to Reigns a year ago at WrestleMania 39. Perhaps he'll be looking for some revenge.\n\nBayley will make her decision as well\n\nWomen's Royal Rumble winner Bayley will also make her title match decision on SmackDown. Her decision might be a little bit tougher though. The obvious choice would be for Bayley to go after Rhea Ripley for the World Women's Championship and give Damage CTRL control of every SmackDown and RAW title. However, after Nia Jax scared Bayley into holding off on her decision until Friday, Bayley may be having second thoughts on taking on Ripley.\n\nOf course, Bayley's only other options would be the NXT title, which wouldn't make much sense given Damage CTRL's insistence on seeing Bayley take the title from Ripley, or to go after fellow Damage CTRL member Iyo Sky for the WWE Women's Championship.

That means 30 NFL fan bases have turned their attention to the offseason, including the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nThe East-West Shrine Bowl and 2024 Senior Bowl this week are providing teams and fans a chance to see more of some of the top prospects in the draft. With that in mind, USA TODAY's Nate Davis released an updated 2024 NFL mock draft now that the first 30 picks are settled.\n\nThis latest mock draft continues dominance on offense among the top picks, with some prospects on that side of the ball jumping into the first round.\n\nNFL mock draft 2024:Five QBs taken in top 12 picks? Prepare for a first-round frenzy.\n\nWhy Bo Nix is rising in mock drafts\n\nNix started his first college football game for the Auburn Tigers against future Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert and the Oregon Ducks. Over the ensuing five seasons of football - three with Auburn, two with Oregon - he set the NCAA record for most college starts with 61.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nHis numbers at Auburn were solid but after transferring to Oregon ahead of the 2022 college football season they improved dramatically. Here's how his time at the two schools compares:\n\nSchool Games Yards Completion percentage TD INT Rating Auburn 34 7,251 59.4% 39 16 126.2 Oregon 27 8,101 74.9% 74 10 177.8\n\nIn his final year at Oregon, he led the FBS in completions, completion percentage, and passing touchdowns. That helped in Davis' reasoning for Nix going 12th overall to the Denver Broncos.\n\nHistoric college career:Oregon's Bo Nix ends 5-year college odyssey as one of most productive QBs in NCAA history\n\nThe Broncos are potentially in the mix for a quarterback in the 2024 NFL Draft after benching Russell Wilson near the end of the regular season. With Wilson likely out in Denver, Davis has the Broncos going with the most accurate quarterback in the FBS, something coach Sean Payton values. During Payton's 15 years as head coach of the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Drew Brees led the league in completion percentage six times.\n\nDavis' NFL mock draft makes Nix the fifth quarterback selected in the first round behind fellow risers J.J. McCarthy (11th to the Minnesota Vikings) and Jayden Daniels (second to the Washington Commanders). Nix struggled in the Senior Bowl which could hurt his chances of going early, but two standout years with Oregon will keep him in the conversation until at least the NFL combine.\n\nRanking college QBs:Who are the top prospects in the 2024 NFL Draft?\n\nWhich wide receivers are rising in mock drafts?\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft may feature one of the deepest wide receiver groups in recent memory. Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr., LSU's Malik Nabers, and Washington's Rome Odunze are consensus top-10 picks and are mocked in the top six in Davis' latest draft. They're not the only ones making the first round, though.\n\nNabers' running mate at LSU, Brian Thomas Jr., led the FBS in receiving touchdowns (17) in 2023. He averaged 17.3 yards per catch and stands at 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds. With a big catch radius and speed for downfield routes, ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. ranked him as the fourth-best wide receiver in this draft. He could be a dangerous deep threat and moves up to 15th overall with the Indianapolis Colts in Davis' mock draft.\n\nOne of the biggest risers in this mock draft is Oregon wide receiver Troy Franklin going 18th overall to the Cincinnati Bengals. Franklin shined in 2023 and finished tied for third in the FBS in receiving touchdowns (14) and sixth in receiving yards (1,383). He didn't make the first round in prior USA TODAY mock drafts but his elite speed could make him a fit for a team like the Bengals, who could see receivers Tee Higgins and Tyler Boyd leave in free agency.\n\n2024 NFL mock drafts:Projections for Drake Maye, Marvin Harrison, and more\n\nWhy offensive linemen are rising in mock drafts\n\nThere are seven offensive linemen in Davis' mock and some are rising up the board. Notre Dame standout Joe Alt stays in the top 10 and goes seventh overall to the Tennessee Titans but the second offensive lineman off the board in this mock is now Oregon State's Taliese Fuaga at 14th overall to the Saints.\n\nFuaga has impressed in one-on-one drills in the Senior Bowl against top competition.\n\nAlt and Penn State's Olumuyiwa \"Olu\" Fashanu are widely considered the top tackles in the draft but Fuaga's potential to play either guard or tackle makes him an intriguing prospect. Fuaga, fellow Pac-12 offensive linemen Jordan Morgan (Arizona) and Troy Fautanu (Washington), and Alabama's JC Latham could fill needs for teams along the offensive line and be selected in the second half of the first round.\n\nOklahoma's Tyler Guyton didn't make the first round of Davis' mock draft but is having a good showing at the Senior Bowl and could move up in future predictions.\n\nHow much is offense dominating 2024 NFL mock drafts?\n\nDavis' latest mock draft is an outlier compared to the last decade. In the last 10 NFL drafts, the first round has had more offensive players selected four times (2021, 2020, 2018, 2015), more defensive players selected five times (2023, 2019, 2017, 2016, 2014), and an even split once (2022).\n\nNone of the last 10 NFL drafts have been as offense-heavy in the first round as Davis' mock. This draft has 19 offensive players in the first round including an incredible 10 players in the first 12 selections. They're almost all at arguably the most important positions on offense with five quarterbacks, seven offensive linemen, and six wide receivers.\n\nThere's only been a 19-13 split in the first round once in the last decade: the 2017 NFL Draft, which leaned defense. Oddly, that year produced defensive stars like Myles Garrett and T.J. Watt but also offensive superstars like Patrick Mahomes and Christian McCaffrey. Even if a first round leans one side of the ball more than the other, fans can likely look forward to future stars on both offense and defense.\n\nGreatest NFL Super Bowl teams:The top 58 \u2013 and not all won Lombardi Trophy\n\nUSA Today's Nate Davis' NFL Mock Draft\n\n*x: Pick order is projected ahead of Super Bowl LVIII."}

This is a guy who has finished in the top 10 in Cy Young voting in each of the past four seasons, averaged 188 innings the last three years while striking out an average of 226 batters, and takes the ball every fifth day.\n\n\u201cCorbin was nothing but a warrior for us,\u2019\u2019 Brewers GM Matt Arnold said. \u201cHe was tremendous in every way, pitched in huge games for us, always took the ball, and was just a winner I\u2019m thrilled for him and his opportunity going forward.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe trade was a stroke of genius for Orioles GM Mike Elias, who is copying the blueprint left from his former boss back in their days together in Houston.\n\nThe Astros, under former GM Jeff Luhnow, tanked their way to 106, 107 and 111 losses in consecutive seasons in 2011-2013.\n\nThey reached the postseason for the first time in 2015 with their young nucleus of Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa, George Springer and Alex Bregman. Then, in the summer of 2017, Luhnow decided that it was finally the right time to trade prospects and go for it. They acquired ace Justin Verlander from the Detroit Tigers for three of their top 11 prospects.\n\nTwo months later, they were World Series champions.\n\nThen, three months after winning their first World Series title, they struck again, this time sending four players to the Pittsburgh Pirates for ace Gerrit Cole. They were back in the World Series two years later, and again in 2021, and again in 2022.\n\nThey have built a dynasty deep in the heart of Texas, reaching the ALCS in seven consecutive seasons with four American League pennants and two World Series titles.\n\nThe Orioles lost 115 games in 2018 when Elias was hired as their GM. He continued the teardown, losing 108 games and 110 games in their next two full seasons. They finally turned the corner with a winning season in 2022, and stunned everyone by winning the AL East last year with their kiddie corps, led by Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson.\n\nElias decided now is the time go for the jugular.\n\nThey went out a traded for a legit No. 1 starter.\n\nThey got their man, too, without damaging their future or present.\n\nSure, rookie infielder Joey Ortiz is a fine defensive player, and perhaps will be a Gold Glove winner one day, but there was absolutely no place for him to be an everyday player on the Orioles\u2019 stacked infield.\n\nLeft-handed pitcher DL Hall was a nice piece in the Orioles\u2019 bullpen, but he wasn\u2019t going to start any time soon, or even be a fixture in the back end of the bullpen.\n\nReally, perhaps the most painful loss for the Orioles was surrendering their competitive balance pick, the 34th pick overall in this summer\u2019s draft, considering the way they\u2019ve struck gold in recent drafts.\n\nThe Orioles will gladly trade all of that to hang a World Series flag at Camden Yards with their new ownership basking on stage with Commissioner Rob Manfred, accepting their trophy, as confetti flies off the Warehouse into the night.\n\nAs for the Brewers, well, you figure them out.\n\nOne minute, they\u2019re telling the world they\u2019re committed to winning the NL Central again, signing rookie Jackson Chourio to a record eight-year, $82 million contract before he played a game in the big leagues while signing free-agent first baseman Rhys Hoskins to a two-year, $34 million contract.\n\nThe next, they\u2019re selling the present for the future, saving about $14 million with Burnes\u2019 $15.637 million contract off the books.\n\n\u201cThe reality of our situation is that we had one year left with Corbin,\u2019\u2019 Arnold said. \u201cI think Corbin has been pretty public about how this was going to be his last year as a Brewer.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrue, Burnes didn\u2019t try to disguise his anger when the Brewers took him to salary arbitration a year ago, and then turned around and hired Scott Boras to be his agent when he hits free agency this winter.\n\nThe Brewers, who are in baseball\u2019s smallest market (at least until the Oakland A\u2019s move to Las Vegas), weren\u2019t about to win a bidding war for Burnes\u2019 services.\n\nSo, the Brewers replace Burnes with Hall, who will be given the opportunity to win a starting job this spring, and they have their shortstop of the future when they let Willy Adames walk away as a free agent after the season, unless they trade him first.\n\n\u201cI wouldn't at all look at this as any kind of rebuild at all,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis is something, in fact, that we think helps us right now and helps us in the future.\u201d\n\nBut come on, let\u2019s be honest here, when in the world has a team traded away their ace and it turned out to be a coup?\n\nThe Tigers traded away Verlander for three prized prospects, remember, and they haven\u2019t been to the postseason in 10 years. The Pirates loved the package they received for Cole in 2018. It was the last season they had a winning record. Philadelphia traded away Curt Schilling in 2000, and watched him help lead the Arizona Diamondbacks to the 2001 World Series while twice finishing runner-up in the Cy Young voting. Boston traded ace Jon Lester in 2014 to Oakland and still haven\u2019t replaced him a decade later.\n\n\u201cI understand that comes with some pain,\u2019\u2019 Arnold said, \u201cand this is not an easy decision for us.\u201d\n\nThe Brewers, of course, are in the perfect division to stay competitive. No one is talented enough to run away with the NL Central title. Yet, for a team that has reached the postseason five of the last six years, who lost manager Craig Counsell to the Chicago Cubs, and who non-tendered injured No. 2 starter Brandon Woodward, this is a huge blow.\n\nThe Brewers\u2019 pain is the Orioles\u2019 gain, with Elias saying just last week that he wasn\u2019t going to make a trade unless it was \u201cthe right deal, the right fit, the right trade.\u201d\n\nThey talked with the Chicago White Sox about ace Dylan Cease, who has two years of club control, but never came close to making an offer to tempt the White Sox. They spoke to dozens of free agent starters, but they weren\u2019t going to bid $325 million on Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and weren\u2019t going to spend $200 million on Blake Snell or $175 million on Jordan Montgomery.\n\nMaybe a year from now when the new ownership, led by private equity mogul David Rubenstein, their spending habits might be different. For now, with the Peter Angelos family still in charge, just adding $15 million to the payroll that will boost it to nearly $100 million, their largest since 2018, is a daring decision.\n\nStill, the Orioles could wind up laughing all of the way to the bank. They have perhaps the most exciting young team in the American League, and should draw 2.5 million fans for the first time since 2005.\n\nThey have a potentially powerful rotation with Burnes, Kyle Bradish, Grayson Rodriguez, John Means and Dean Kremer, with Tyler Wells and Cole Irvin as possibilities.\n\nAnd they still have the No. 1 prospect in baseball with Jackson Holliday, along with four other top 100 prospects.\n\nThey\u2019ve got the makings of their own dynasty.\n\nSee you in October.\n\nMaybe November, too.\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale"}

Austin was searching for a home game to complete its upcoming football schedule.\n\nA brand-new program from Oakland, California, offered to help.\n\nThe Lincoln University Oaklanders aren\u2019t a Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) school like the Lumberjacks. Nor are they affiliated with Division II, Division III, the NAIA, the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), or any other football division or conference.\n\nBut because the Oaklanders are classified as a \u201ccountable opponent\u201d under the NCAA\u2019s rules, Stephen F. Austin confirmed the statistics from the game would still count. So, they played.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got to fill games, you\u2019ve got to fill games,\u201d Stephen F. Austin athletic director Ryan Ivey explained.\n\nThe Oaklanders got bludgeoned in the game, 61-13, but they pocketed $50,000 for participating.\n\nIt was the first of 14 contests they\u2019ve played against FCS teams over the past three years \u2013 a series of lopsided losses that have helped keep their threadbare program alive.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports research found that Lincoln is one of the few college football programs in the country with no ties to a governing body. And beyond the troubling allegations levied by current and former players and coaches about the program, there are questions about how teams like the Oaklanders are able to exist in the first place.\n\nHow can a school with no football facilities or access to federal financial aid money recruit former Division I football players, as Lincoln does? How can a team with meager financial resources still manage to play every game on the road, as Lincoln does? And how can a program with no oversight from the NCAA schedule games against FCS schools on a consistent basis?\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how Lincoln, and other schools like it, stay alive at the bottom of college football\u2019s ladder.\n\nWhat is a \u2018countable opponent?\u2019\n\nThere are roughly 1,100 schools in the NCAA, spread across three divisions. But sometimes, usually out of necessity, those schools must go outside the NCAA to fill their schedules.\n\nIn an effort to fairly represent the statistics and results from those games, the NCAA established a set of criteria that opposing schools have to meet in order for the contest to count. Then, in 2015, it refined those rules after a series of athletic teams from dubious schools began appearing on NCAA schedules.\n\n\u201cCompetition against these teams has led to inflated statistics and results, some of which we feel have compromised the integrity of our national statistics and records,\u201d NCAA director of media coordination and statistics David Worlock wrote in a 2015 memo to membership.\n\nUnder the NCAA\u2019s revised rules, the pool of countable opponents automatically includes the 333 schools in the NAIA and NCCAA, as well as about 100 others who meet baseline academic requirements. Each school must be a \u201cfour-year, degree-granting institution\u201d that is accredited by a regional body for its sports team to qualify as a countable opponent.\n\nSo is Lincoln an accredited school?\n\nYes. Lincoln University is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges \u2013 though it does have some nontraditional quirks.\n\nThe school has historically catered to international students, who made up two-thirds of its undergraduate student population as recently as 2015. And it also has a substantial number of international faculty. According to its website, nearly half of Lincoln\u2019s professors earned at least one of their degrees outside of the U.S.\n\nTen faculty members studied in Russia, including the school's president, Mikhail Brodsky, who earned multiple advanced degrees at a university in Moscow.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to teach students. My goal is not athletics,\u201d Brodsky, who also owns a Russian bathhouse in San Francisco, told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education, Lincoln had 370 full-time students as of Fall 2022, the most recent year for which statistics are available.\n\nIts most recent academic catalog shows that it offers four types of business degrees with various concentrations, including marketing management and international business. It also offers degrees in one unrelated field: Diagnostic imaging.\n\nDoes Lincoln have sports teams besides football?\n\nThe Oaklanders football team is one of at least five athletic programs offered by the school. Lincoln also competes in men's and women's basketball and men's and women's soccer. According to its website, it has also hired coaches for baseball and softball, and lists track and field as a future offering.\n\nThe athletic department's most recognizable figure is an NBA legend: Gary Payton, who coaches the men's basketball team.\n\nIt is unclear if Lincoln\u2019s athletic department follows the gender equity provisions of Title IX, because the school has not filed the athletics data that most of its peers are required to submit under the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act.\n\nLincoln is not subject to the act because it is currently not eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs for students.\n\nWait, students at Lincoln can\u2019t get financial aid?\n\nNot at the moment.\n\nAn Education Department spokesperson told USA TODAY Sports in an email that the university lost its access to federal aid programs, more commonly known as FAFSA, in 2021 due to an accreditation issue. Specifically, Lincoln switched to its current accreditor while it was still under sanctions from its previous one.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Education Department later found that Lincoln had also not met state regulations, which would\u2019ve made it ineligible for FAFSA even before it switched accreditors.\n\nBrodsky said the university has applied to rejoin the federal aid program.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a crime that it\u2019s taken from us because we didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nMultiple former football assistants said Lincoln\u2019s financial aid status caused confusion among players about what sort of assistance would be available to them. The school\u2019s head football coach and athletic director, Desmond Gumbs, said the terms of each player\u2019s aid were clearly spelled out in the letter of intent each signed during the recruitment process.\n\nWhy did players go to Lincoln?\n\nMany current and former players told USA TODAY Sports they went to Lincoln for the same reason: A chance to play against the Division I teams listed on its schedule.\n\nIn 2023, the Oaklanders played eight FCS teams, including four Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The schedule was a focal point of Lincoln coaches\u2019 recruiting pitches, players said. Some viewed it as a stepping stone.\n\n\u201cI was using the school to get the film I need to get out of there,\u201d long snapper Etem Ulusan said.\n\nKicker/punter Steven Earnest said he was on the roster at Point University, an NAIA school, last year when a coach from Lincoln called during fall camp and offered him a scholarship.\n\nHe said he had never heard of Lincoln before but figured he was better off kicking against Division I schools than those in the NAIA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the schedule is what got everyone here,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThe only thing is I don\u2019t really know how they get the schedule, because you saw, we get smoked every game.\u201d\n\nThe Oaklanders went 0-12 last season and have won just three of their 33 games.\n\nWhy do NCAA programs schedule teams like Lincoln?\n\nIvey acknowledged that he didn\u2019t know much about the Oaklanders when he scheduled them in 2021. All he knew is that they would fit a need. The Lumberjacks had just switched conferences and needed a home game on a specific date that would count toward their final record.\n\n\u201cThe challenge with football scheduling is these games are scheduled years in advance,\u201d Ivey said. \u201cWe needed to fill a game so we were able to fill it with them.\u201d\n\nWestern Oregon athletic director Randi Lydum said Lincoln first reached out to her in 2021 about scheduling a game in the fall. She knew it would be a home game, and likely a win.\n\nLocated in Monmouth, Oregon, the Division II Wolves sometimes struggle to schedule home games because their home stadium is more than an hour's drive south of Portland and they can\u2019t offer a large payout to visiting teams, Lydum said. But they offered to pay for Lincoln\u2019s bus trips to and from the Portland airport and one night of hotel rooms at a nearby Hampton Inn.\n\nWestern Oregon won that first game, 55-16, then scheduled Lincoln again in 2022 and 2023 \u2013 two more wins. It is the only school to schedule the Oaklanders every year.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s kind of the same thing as if some of the big D1 (teams) schedule schools like us,\u201d Lydum said.\n\nContact the reporters at tschad@usatoday.com and jpeter@usatoday.com"}

We have to run a program the way it\u2019s supposed to be ran, not halfway (expletive).\u2019\u2019\n\nMikhail Brodsky, the president at Lincoln University, fired back when told of Payton\u2019s complaints \u2013 similar to complaints lodged by former football players and assistant football coaches.\n\n\u201cGary is a spoiled child,\u2019\u2019 Brodsky said. \u201cWe have to understand he is a star and he wants everybody to service him. And if somebody\u2019s not servicing him, he\u2019s frustrated.\u2019\u2019\n\nDesmond Gumbs, Lincoln's athletic director and head football coach, said Payton's teams have traveled to Hawaii in each of their three seasons.\n\nPayton said he took the job for a chance to work with players in his hometown of Oakland.\n\n\"I'm here for these kids, basically,'' Payton said. \"That's about it. It's nothing else.''\n\nBut he also indicated his frustration has escalated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve stuck around too long,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe should have been better than this.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe team is scheduled to play the final game of its regular season Feb. 24, and Payton said he would not step down as coach before then.\n\n\"I've got good kids,'' he said. \"I think if I quit right now I'd be quitting on the players because they came here because of me.''\n\nGary Payton says players were deceived\n\nFormer Lincoln football players said they incurred unanticipated costs because they were promised more than they received after they arrived at the school. Gumbs, the school\u2019s athletic director, denied the allegation.\n\nBut Payton suggested something similar happened to basketball players.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, if we come out and be honest with the (athletes) and say, \u2018Yo, this is what we got. This is what you going to have to do. But we can help you with this,\u2019 the (expletive), it\u2019d be different,\u2019\u2019 Payton said. \u201cThen these players wouldn\u2019t come in here expecting something that they\u2019re not having \u2026 \u2019\u2019\n\nPayton said three players left because they were \u201clied to,\u2019\u2019 but he did not provide additional information about what happened or say when the players left.\n\nLincoln's most recently available tax records show that Payton made $112,500 during the 2021 calendar year. Brodsky wrote in an email that Payton was paid an additional $90,000 in the early part of 2022 before the university stopped paying him \"due to (a) lack of funds.\"\n\nPayton has worked the past two seasons as a volunteer and said that, in the absence of funding from the university, he's used some of his own money to help keep the program running.\n\n\u201cSome days I come in here and I don\u2019t have a trainer because he\u2019s got to go and work and do something else,\u2019\u2019 he said. \"We don\u2019t have a full-time trainer because we can\u2019t pay nobody.''\n\nPayton also said the team is behind on payments at Open Gym Premier, the practice facility in Oakland that Lincoln's team uses. \"No other details on my end,'' Matt Kanne, CEO at Open Gym Premier, wrote in a text message.\n\n\u201cWe got stuff up in here that\u2019s going on that\u2019s just crazy,'' Payton said. \"But it\u2019s a time to put your foot down. My foot is down.\u2019\u2019\n\nLincoln president shifts onus onto Gary Payton\n\nBrodsky said Payton should accept responsibility for some of the financial issues.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s spending money like crazy,\u2019\u2019 Lincoln\u2019s president said, noting that the basketball team\u2019s travel party has included 12 players and seven staff members. This year the team has traveled to Seattle, New Mexico and Hawaii, according to assistant coach Glen Graham.\n\nThe team's results are not listed on the school's athletic website, but Graham said the team went 5-3 during 2021-22, a season shortened by COVID-19; 19-12 in 2022-23; and is 15-6 this season.\n\nLast year, Payton and his agent approached Brodsky about the possibility of hiring someone to raise money for the athletic department. But Brodsky said it would be too expensive and he put the onus back on Payton.\n\n\u201cIf Gary would really want to do something for sport, he has to raise money using his name. Not for himself, but the university,\u2019\u2019 Brodsky said. \u201cMy goal is to teach students. I honestly don\u2019t care what Gary thinks as a coach because if I teach students in Oakland, I\u2019m successful. If they get an education, I\u2019m successful. If they are not professional players, I don\u2019t care \u2026\n\n\u201cI told Gary many times about this. We had open discussions, we respect each other, but he doesn\u2019t understand that this is not a professional team.\u2019\u2019\n\nAthletic director tells Gary Payton: 'You killed us'\n\nWhile watching Payton lead practice last month, Gumbs predicted success.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, give Gary a few more years with the right support, he\u2019ll fill the Oakland (Arena),\u2019\u2019 Gumbs said, referring to the former home of the Golden State Warriors.\n\nBut Payton seemed to shoot down the idea when he launched into a tirade about problems at the school.\n\nOf Gumbs\u2019 role in the situation, Payton said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what he do. But don\u2019t keep giving me dreams. Dreams. Dreams. Because all this (expletive) is dreams. Because this program ain\u2019t right and my players ain\u2019t getting what they\u2019re supposed to be getting.\u2019\u2019\n\nGumbs has shared similar hopes with the football players and assistant coaches. He\u2019s talked of Lincoln playing home games at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, which was home to the Raiders before the NFL team relocated to Las Vegas in 2020. After three seasons, the football team has yet to play a single home game.\n\nWhen Payton finished an interview with USA TODAY Sports and walked toward his office, Gumbs said to Payton, \u201cYou killed us.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo which Payton shot back, \u201cI didn\u2019t kill us. I told the (expletive) truth!\u2019\u2019\n\nContact reporter Josh Peter at jpeter@usatoday.com"}

He said he's optimistic about the program's future even though the team has no place to play home games, limited resources and a host of former players and coaches critical of the program.\n\nLike the team, Gumbs has endured hard times.\n\nOver the past two decades, he\u2019s been hit with foreclosure proceedings, bankruptcy filings and civil lawsuits over allegedly unpaid bills. But none of that stopped Gumbs from landing the job as head football coach and athletic director at Lincoln in 2020 despite no apparent prior experience in college sports.\n\nOr stop him during Lincoln's 2022 football season from spearheading a boxing event that featured Terence Crawford, who was widely considered the sport's top pound-for-pound fighter. Or stop him from working with Suge Knight on a potential TV series chronicling the life of the imprisoned co-founder of Death Row Records.\n\n\"He\u2019s a true hustler,\" said Mario Thornton, a former police officer who said he has coached with Gumbs and known him for more than two decades.\n\nDesmond Gumbs makes foray into boxing\n\nDuring the 2022 season, the week Lincoln was preparing to play Texas Southern, boxer Adrien Broner announced he\u2019d signed a three-fight deal worth at least $10 million with a company called BLK Prime spearheaded by Gumbs.\n\n\"I told my man Desmond that he\u2019s coming into boxing at a unique time,\" Broner said at the time.\n\nA company called BLK Prime Ltd registered in England lists Gumbs as its officer, according to a British corporate record. Zab Judah, a retired world champion boxer who has worked with Gumbs on boxing matters, said Gumbs makes all decisions for BLK Prime and related entities.\n\nThough Gumbs said he tried to keep his involvement in boxing quiet, it became hard to do after BLK Prime signed Broner.\n\nThen, a little more than two weeks after Lincoln lost its season finale to Southern Utah, 55-0, Crawford publicly disclosed BLK Prime had guaranteed him $10 million to fight David Avanesyan on Dec. 10 in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nCrawford, with his WBO welterweight belt on the line, knocked out Avanesyan in the sixth round at the CHI Health Center. The announced attendance was 14,630, and the fight was available on pay-per-view through the BLK Prime app for $39.99.\n\nThe promoter for the event was \"BLK Prime (principal Desmond Gumbs),\" according to Aaron Hendry, who heads the Nebraska Athletic Commission.\n\nCrawford had no comment for this story, according to his publicist, Julie Goldsticker.\n\nIn January, referring to his father\u2019s wisdom, Gumbs told USA TODAY Sports the Crawford-Avanesyan fight \"started with an idea, the 75-25 \u2026 I have the same vision at Lincoln.\"\n\nIn February 2023, Broner announced on social media that he and BLK Prime had decided to part ways. \"They just couldn't deliver everything that I needed at this point of my career,\" Broner said.\n\nDesmond Gumbs working with Suge Knight\n\nStarting with the high school ranks, Gumbs has been coaching football since the 1990s. But his life always has consisted of more than football.\n\nThe entertainment industry has captured his interest.\n\nGumbs directed films such as \"Straight Out\" in 2003, \"Rude Boy: The Jamaican Don\" in 2003 and \"Don\u2019t Blink\" in 2007, mostly with little-known actors.\n\n\"I\u2019ve had more things that didn\u2019t work out than things that did, entertainment-wise,\" Gumbs said.\n\nIn April 2023, Suge Knight told TMZ he was working with BLK Prime on a TV series that would chronicle his life.\n\nIn June, BLK Prime announced it was holding casting calls in several major cities across the country. Then, of the project, BLK Prime posted on its website, \"Coming this fall.\"\n\nThe fall came and went.\n\nNo premiere. No new announcements.\n\n\"A lot's happened since last fall,\" Gumbs said, but he provided no details about the future of the project.\n\nBut he also insisted the project with Knight is still in the works.\n\n\"I talked to Suge three times today,\" Gumbs said. \"I talk to him a few times a day every day. So I know him enough that he didn\u2019t sign with Netflix, he didn\u2019t sign with Showtime. He signed with BLK Prime, right?\"\n\nTerri Hardy, press secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), said by email the CDCR is not aware of such a project involving Knight and BLK Prime. And, Hardy added, \"It\u2019s important to note that incarcerated people cannot, by law, profit from any activity or business.\"\n\nKnight, who is serving a 28-year prison sentence for a fatal hit-and-run, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBefore Lincoln, there was Stellar Prep\n\nFollowing the real estate crash of 2007-08, Gumbs said, he was \"completely broke.\" In fact, Gumbs still owed more than $1.2 million from a bankruptcy case as of 2022, records show.\n\nMalcolm Leader-Picone, an attorney in the case, said in 2021 he unsuccessfully tried to garnish Gumbs' wages from Lincoln University. Gumbs said he does not draw a salary from Lincoln and the school's president, Mikhail Brodsky, said there was no choice but to bring Gumbs on as a volunteer when the athletic department began.\n\n\"We never had funds for it and would never hire Desmond or anybody else for the position if it is paid,\" Brodsky said by email, adding that Gumbs signed documents confirming his volunteer status until the athletic department can be \"self-supporting and generate funds.\"\n\nGumbs has cited his experience in schools as credentials for his role at Lincoln.\n\nIn 2011, Gumbs said, he opened Stellar Preparatory High School, a private school in the Bay area. Like Gumbs has done at Lincoln, he built a football team from scratch at Stellar Prep.\n\nHis two sons and eight other former players went on to play college football, according to Stellar Prep's website. But, not unlike Gumbs' team at Lincoln, Stellar Prep sometimes found itself overmatched. For example, there was a game against Half Moon Bay High School in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"We only have 16 kids,\" Gumbs told the Half Moon Bay Review before the game, which Stellar Prep lost 47-14. \"It\u2019s ironman football for sure. But we\u2019re just glad to be playing.\"\n\nGumbs said he\u2019s proudest of having provided a free education to underserved Black, Hispanic and Polynesian students. \"I didn\u2019t charge anyone anything,\" he said.\n\nAsked how he paid for the school and provided free education despite going broke during the real estate crash, Gumbs replied, \"Three letters \u2013 God.\"\n\nEach year the school serves no more than 40 students, according to Gumbs. Though online records from the California Department of Education show that the school closed June 30, 2023, Gumbs says it is still open.\n\n\"I think legitimately he was trying his best to make something good happen,\" said Justin Redemer, who between 2011 and 2020 was the head coach at Hayward High School, less than a mile from the building where Stellar Prep has been housed. \"Whether or not that happened at Lincoln, I think his intention there was the same.\"\n\nNow, Gumbs and the two schools are intertwined.\n\nA decade after it opened, Stellar Prep secured accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Through that process, Gumbs met Brodsky, the two men said.\n\nWith Lincoln\u2019s enrollment on the decline, Brodsky said, Gumbs convinced him that an athletic department would boost enrollment. \"It was a decision I made based on what I heard from Desmond,\" Brodsky told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nIt began with an idea.\n\nContact reporter Josh Peter at jpeter@usatoday.com."}

The San Francisco 49ers earned a spot in that game thanks to a 34-31 comeback win over the Detroit Lions. That clinched the team's first trip to the Super Bowl since the 2020 NFL playoffs.\n\nMany of the players from that team are still on the roster but there's one big difference at quarterback. Second-year starter Brock Purdy leads the 49ers' offense in their quest for a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about him:\n\nBest of the best:The 58 greatest NFL teams to play in the Super Bowl \u2013 and not all won Lombardi Trophy\n\nWhere is Brock Purdy from?\n\nPurdy was born on December 27, 1999 in Queen Creek, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix. His father Shawn pitched in four minor league baseball levels and his sister Whittney played softball at Southeastern University.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nAccording to the high school sports coverage website MaxPreps, Purdy started at quarterback for Perry High School for three years. He totaled 5,422 yards (4,405 passing, 1,017 rushing) and 67 touchdowns (57 passing, 10 rushing) as a senior to lead Perry to the 6A Division AIA State Championship game. The Pumas lost 49-42 to state powerhouse Chandler High School.\n\nThat senior season earned him 2017 Arizona High School Football Player of the Year from the Arizona Republic. Purdy beat out future Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson and South Carolina quarterback Spencer Rattler for the award.\n\nWhere did Brock Purdy go to school?\n\nThe recruiting website 247Sports rated Purdy as a three-star prospect and the 50th-ranked quarterback in the Class of 2018. Many future NFL quarterbacks were ranked ahead of him, including Trevor Lawrence (first), Justin Fields (second), Dorian Thompson-Robinson (sixth), Matt Corral (eighth), and Will Levis (49th).\n\nPer 247Sports, Purdy received offers from Iowa State, Alabama, Boise State, Texas A&M, and UCF. He chose Iowa State from that group and joined the Cyclones' football team starting in the 2018 season.\n\n'Stuff that you can't measure':Super Bowl-bound QB Brock Purdy was ahead of the curve at Perry, coaches recall\n\nBrock Purdy college stats\n\nPurdy played in 10 games as a freshman for Iowa State, starting eight of them, after entering the 2018 season as the third-string quarterback. He set school freshman records for passing yards and passing touchdowns.\n\nAs a sophomore, he led the Cyclones to a 7-6 record. He set a school record for total offense with 510 yards against Louisiana-Monroe and put up six total touchdowns in a one-point loss to a ranked Oklahoma Sooners squad.\n\nIowa State improved to 9-3 in Purdy's junior season thanks to future New York Jets running back Breece Hall's stellar play. Purdy won his first bowl game that year with a 34-17 win over Oregon in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nAs a senior, Purdy set a career-high in completion percentage (71.7) as the Cyclones went 7-6 again. Hall's improvement lessened the scoring load on Purdy and he had a career-low 20 total touchdowns in 2021.\n\nPurdy holds the career records for passing yards, completions, attempts, completion percentage, passing touchdowns, and the top two longest passing touchdown streaks in Iowa State history.\n\nWhere was Brock Purdy drafted?\n\nPurdy declared for the 2022 NFL Draft with mixed projections as to when he'd be selected. Draft Wire didn't include him in a top 300 prospects ranking; Pro Football Focus rated him as the 165th prospect of the draft; NFL.com rated him as the 15th-best quarterback in the class and graded him as a priority undrafted free agent.\n\nAfter 261 names were called, the San Francisco 49ers made Purdy the final and 262nd pick of the 2022 NFL Draft, earning the title of Mr. Irrelevant.\n\nBrock Purdy NFL stats\n\nPurdy entered his rookie season as the 49ers' third-string quarterback. Season-ending injuries to starter Trey Lance in Week 2 and backup Jimmy Garoppolo in Week 13 changed things quickly. Purdy took over for Garoppolo and led the 49ers to seven consecutive wins, including the playoffs, before suffering a torn UCL in the 2023 NFC championship game in the 49ers' 31-7 loss. He came back as the full-time starter in 2023.\n\nHere's how his stats look in his first two seasons as the 49ers' quarterback:\n\nYear Record Yards TD INT Completion percentage Rating 2022 5-0 1,374 13 4 67.1 107.3 2023 12-4 4,280 31 11 69.4 113.0\n\nAnd his playoff statistics:\n\nYear Record Yards TD INT Completion percentage Rating 2022 2-1 569 3 0 65.1 109.8 2023 2-0 519 2 1 61.4 111.5\n\nBrock Purdy's ranking in San Francisco history\n\nSan Francisco has a history of great quarterbacks. Hall of Fame quarterbacks Joe Montana and Steve Young combined for five Super Bowl victories, four MVP awards, and four Super Bowl MVP awards. Fellow Hall of Famer Y.A. Tittle won the 1963 MVP award and made seven Pro Bowls over 10 seasons with the 49ers.\n\nThere's also standout quarterbacks who haven't made the Hall of Fame but still shined for 49ers. John Brodie won the 1970 MVP award and made two Pro Bowl teams; Jeff Garcia made three consecutive Pro Bowls and led the team to playoff berths in 2001 and 2002; Colin Kaepernick led the team to a Super Bowl in 2012 behind electric playoff performances.\n\nPurdy already ranks 11th in passing yards and 10th in passing touchdowns in franchise history. He holds the 49ers record for best completion percentage with at least 10 games played.\n\nHe became the first 49ers rookie quarterback to start and win a playoff game. In 2023, he set the franchise single-game record for completion percentage at 95.2% in Week 4, passing yards in a season with 4,280 in 16 games, and passer rating in a season with 113.0.\n\nThe right guy:Stop picking on 49ers' QB Brock Purdy. He takes so much heat for 'absolutely no reason'\n\nBrock Purdy's ranking in NFL history\n\nPurdy's played in just 30 NFL games between the regular season and playoffs. Because of that, he doesn't meet the criteria for many NFL career leaderboards requiring at least 1,500 regular season pass attempts (Purdy's at 614).\n\nIf he were included, Purdy's 111.4 passer rating and 68.7% completion percentage would be the best career marks in NFL history.\n\nHe's also set multiple NFL firsts and records, including:\n\nFirst Mr. Irrelevant to throw a touchdown pass in a regular season game.\n\nFirst quarterback to go 6-0 as a starter with at least two touchdown passes in each game to begin his career.\n\nTied for the most games with a passer rating over 130 (6) and 140 (4) in a season.\n\nBrock Purdy awards\n\nPurdy earned NFC Rookie of the Month honors twice as a rookie in December 2022 and January 2023. He also made the PFWA All-Rookie team in 2022.\n\nBrock Purdy's personal life\n\nPurdy grew up as a Miami Dolphins fan and has worn the number 13 since his youth football days in honor of Dolphins Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino.\n\nPurdy proposed to his girlfriend Jenna Brandt in July 2023. The two met at Iowa State where Brandt played for the Cyclones' volleyball team before she transferred to Northern Iowa.\n\nHis younger brother Chubba was a four-star prospect from Perry High School and spent two years each at Florida State and Nebraska before transferring to Nevada ahead of the 2024 college football season.\n\nPurdy's recent brand endorsements include Alaska Airlines and Toyota.\n\nRun it back:Let's do this again, shall we?

CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince later wrote on X the company made a mistake in \"not being more kind and humane\" in laying off its workers.\n\nThe trauma of losing a job can be severe \u2212 and it gets exacerbated if the loss comes suddenly or gets delivered in a cold, unfeeling manner.\n\nThis is because many people base their sense of self around what they do for work. When that gets stripped away, it can feel like losing your purpose.\n\n\"It's our identity we take on. It's our livelihood. It's our income. It can be our socialization,\" Kessler says. \"It's such a part of our life, and we underestimate the trauma that occurs when those losses happen.\"\n\nWhen people do get laid off, many want to know why, even if the reason has nothing to do their performance. Many times, however, companies stick with vague platitudes, instead of being specific about why someone's lay off was necessary.\n\n\"Often people hear, 'It's not personal,' but it's personal to you,\" Kessler says. \"Of course, you want to try to understand the numbers. Of course, you want to try to understand the reasons. Of course, you want to know who made the decision and not be talking to strangers.\"\n\nErik Anderson, a licensed marriage and family therapist, says Pietsch's video encapsulates the frustration and absurdity many laid-off employees feel.\n\n\"Here's this woman confronting a very depressing situation that leads to a loss of meaning, a loss of faith,\" he says. \"I think that really does contribute to feelings of depression and even struggle functioning in the world.\"\n\nIs your workplace toxic?'We're a family here,' and other major red flags to watch for\n\nMany who experience trauma want to take power back\n\nPietsch isn't alone. Last month, Chloe Shih shared her unfiltered reaction to finding out she was laid off from Discord via an email, and TikTok user @jewishmillennial shared her morning routine as she awaited official confirmation of her lay off. Their TikTok videos garnered 4.4 million and 3.8 million views, respectively.\n\nThough some may find it inappropriate to share difficult experiences like this online, experts say it can feel empowering and make others going through something similar feel less alone.\n\nAmy Morin, a psychotherapist, author and host of the podcast \"Mentally Stronger,\" says people may be driven to film themselves going through traumatic situations in order to feel a sense of agency in the process.\n\n\"It's about saying, 'I'm going to own the story... I'm going to say, this is what happened to me today, and when I share it on my own terms, I somehow feel empowered.' \"\n\nKessler says he hopes the viral videos serve as a reminder that how someone delivers bad news matters.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we're all human beings dealing with human beings,\" he says. \"That doesn't mean we can't humanize even the bad things that happen. You can break up with someone without abandoning them. You can release someone from their work without making them feel uncared for and depersonalized. It's really raising awareness that we can do this better.\"\n\nFeel the urge to 'quiet quit'?Time to check in with your mental health, experts say"}

Those were the days on which the government released new jobs data and, in doing so, offered a sort-of-real-time assessment of how President Obama was doing in steering the country out of the recession that began several years prior.\n\nIn October 2012, those numbers showed continued improvement, to the White House\u2019s relief: The economy had added 114,000 jobs in September. But Jack Welch, one of the biggest names in the business world and an endorser of Obama\u2019s 2012 opponent, wasn\u2019t buying it.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable jobs numbers..,\u201d he wrote on then-Twitter. \u201c[T]hese Chicago guys will do anything..can\u2019t debate so change numbers.\u201d\n\nThe implication was that the numbers were fake, that the economy was faring worse than those numbers would suggest, and so the administration must have been goosing them. This was obviously not true, but that the allegation was made at all was telling: Welch felt either like the numbers were wrong or that it was politically useful to pretend they were, or both.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLittle did we know then that this was a preview of things to come.\n\nThis Friday was the first in February, so the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its estimates for job changes in January. The numbers were very good, beating expectations handily.\n\nIn fact, since Joe Biden took office, the country has added jobs every month. His first year was obviously boosted by the faster-than-normal addition of jobs in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. That said, there have been seven months since the start of 2022 in which the country added more jobs than were added in the best month of Donald Trump\u2019s first three years in office. In 2023 alone, the country added almost half the total number of jobs that were added from 2017 to 2019.\n\nLooking at annual change, you can see the increase in employment under Biden. That big dip in employment 2020 was reversed by May 2022.\n\nThe White House points to this number frequently, often contrasting growth under Biden\u2019s administration with the net loss under Trump\u2019s \u2014 which includes the losses of the pandemic. It is one of several data points to which the White House cites to show that, despite rumblings to the contrary, the economy is doing well. The stock market is up, they\u2019ll say, correctly, as are wages. More people are working in manufacturing now than at any point since the recession 15 years ago \u2014 though the number of people in the labor force is also much larger.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s critics and Americans more broadly point to another countervailing set of data: prices. Yes, the spike in the rate of inflation is over, but prices are higher than they were several years ago.\n\nFor months, the increase in prices outpaced increases in wages, though that pattern has reversed over the past year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolling released by CNN on Friday shows that about half of Americans think the economy is improving or at least stable, while half think that it is continuing to get worse. That\u2019s not great for Biden on the surface, but CNN\u2019s Ariel Edwards-Levy notes that this is an improvement over recent months.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nEarlier this week, Gallup released data showing a similar, modest turnaround. People are still feeling the effects of inflation, but views are turning more positive.\n\nIn other words, the negative sentiment that\u2019s driven consideration of the economy particularly since 2022 \u2014 when gas prices spiked \u2014 appears to be softening.\n\nBut that sentiment isn\u2019t only driven by objective metrics any more than Jack Welch\u2019s skepticism was in 2012. A lot of it is also politics.\n\nConsider the results when CNN broke out its question about the economy by party. Half of Democrats think the economy is improving. Half of independents think it is improving or stable. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans think it\u2019s getting worse.\n\nPart of this is motivated reasoning. When projected GDP growth was negative for the second quarter in a row in 2022, there was a strong push on the right to declare that the country was in recession. It wasn\u2019t, as subsequent data has shown. With the midterms looming, this was a good indicator of how economic data would be treated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s been a dramatic polarization of economic data in recent years, particularly on the right. Gallup data show that Republican sentiment on the economy plunged at the start of the recession that began in 2007. It remained low during the Obama administration \u2014 and then skyrocketed under Trump. There was no real reason for that massive jump, as the numbers shown at the start of this article suggest, but, then, sentiment is necessarily subjective.\n\nWhat\u2019s notable, though, is that Republican sentiment plunged once Biden took office \u2014 to levels below where they\u2019d been during the recession.\n\nThat\u2019s visible, too, in the University of Michigan\u2019s Survey of Consumers. The same pattern: a huge spike under Trump and a huge plunge under Biden that outpaces the post-recession era.\n\nThis is almost certainly a function in part of Trump\u2019s self-promotion. He was relentless about hyping the economy, cherry-picking data to suggest that it was better than it had ever been. It was a habit that leveraged existing thermostatic shifts in opinion \u2014 that is, that public opinion often changes when political leadership does \u2014 with the effect of amplifying them. Even now he is trying to take credit for the surge in the stock market, a claim that even the endlessly loyal Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business finds hard to accept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, Biden can\u2019t fix. Particularly running against Trump, he\u2019s not going to be able to convince most Republicans that the economy is getting better. He can probably continue to peel some away, assuming the existing trends in the economy continue, but not much more than that.\n\nThere is an interesting detail to pick out of this for those looking forward to November. That year was a bad one, relatively speaking, with costs increasing, gas prices soaring and the sense of optimism about the pandemic hobbled. Even among Democrats, sentiment about the economy was dour. And then Republicans underperformed in the midterms."}

Industry leader McDonald\u2019s raised its prices by 10 percent last year \u2014 on top of the 10 percent they went up the year before that \u2014 and chains such as Chipotle and Chick-fil-A are steadily and substantially hiking their prices, too.\n\nConsumers, many of whom count on drive-throughs for sustenance on a budget, are supersized mad about it, too. Diners\u2019 tales of the eye-popping amounts they paid for their food \u2014 a $16 Big Mac meal in Idaho in 2022 and an $18 one in Connecticut last year \u2014 have gone viral.\n\nTo appeal to the pinched, some chains are focusing on making their value menus, which typically feature lower-priced, a la carte items, more attractive. Chief among them is Taco Bell, which has long been known as the destination for the broke and hungry. Last month, it debuted a retooled \u201cCravings Value Menu\u201d of 10 items, each for $3 or less. The lineup, which includes four existing items and six new ones, is aimed at people looking for \u201cmore satiating, meal-sized items,\u201d and not just snacks, the company said in a news release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe chain\u2019s recent ad featuring the band Portugal the Man plays up its role as the original go-to spot for cheapsters. \u201cIt was the one restaurant we could afford on like our $3 per diem,\u201d one of the musicians says. \u201cYou were living when you went to Taco Bell.\u201d\n\nSo it seems beggars can be choosers after all \u2014 but which of the chain\u2019s \u201cvalue\u201d items are actually bargains? To find out, we tried all of them, a collection that costs just over $20 total and weighs in at nearly four pounds of food. (The total: $20.71 for 3.78 pounds.)\n\nThe prices listed below are those on the chain\u2019s website, though I should note that the prices at my nearest location, inside Washington\u2019s Union Station, were higher \u2014 perhaps because you expect to pay more for just about everything at a train station that\u2019s often flooded with tourists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how they stacked up:\n\nCheesy Roll Up\n\n$1 / 3 ounces\n\nThis slight specimen, which consists of nothing but grated cheese melted and rolled in a tortilla, is the cheapest item on the menu, but honestly, it didn\u2019t seem like a great deal. \u201cIt looks like a pencil eraser,\u201d one colleague said, before biting into it. \u201cAnd it kind of tastes like a pencil eraser.\u201d (To be fair, it probably suffered the most of any of the value-menu array from the delay between ordering and eating, since there\u2019s nothing to distract you from that unfortunately seized-up cheese.) At best, it\u2019s something you could imagine ordering to keep a post-errands, meltdown-approaching toddler from ruining the trip home.\n\nCheesy Bean and Rice Burrito\n\n$1.19 / 6.5 ounces\n\nBeans and rice are a budget diner\u2019s staples, and they reunite here for my favorite item on this menu. Pleasantly salty refried beans form the bass line of this straightforward combination, and I\u2019m here for that. I didn\u2019t pick up on much of the \u201ccreamy jalape\u00f1o sauce\u201d that was allegedly in the mix, but a dab from one of Taco Bell\u2019s hot sauce packets (\u201cfire\u201d is my go-to) perked up the flavor. This is what I would order for myself to fend off a hangry fit.\n\nSpicy Potato Soft Taco\n\n$1.19 / 4 ounces\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother winner for vegetarians, for whom Taco Bell is the rare fast-food chain with varied options \u2014 or anyone wary of most fast-food proteins. The potatoes were decently crispy, and the chipotle sauce added complexity, though maybe not in a good way, due to a faux-smoke note that I found off-putting.\n\nDouble Stacked Taco\n\n$1.99 / 4.75 ounces\n\nTaco Bell has a knack for pairing crunchy textures with soft, and this item employs the chain\u2019s fun party trick of layering a hard taco shell within a soft tortilla, glued together with some nacho cheese sauce (a configuration that not only creates a pleasant juxtaposition but also cuts down on the mess of a crumbling shell). Alas, the beef brings the whole thing down \u2014 I personally dislike the fine, nearly paste-like texture of Taco Bell\u2019s ground beef mixture. But if you\u2019re a fan, this is otherwise appealing.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nStacker\n\n$2.19 / 5.25 ounces\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf biting into six layers of tortilla encasing a relatively thin filling (of ground beef, cheese and nacho cheese sauce) is your idea of a good time, this one is for you. If that sounds like a carb-heavy, low-flavor proposition [raises hand], you should look elsewhere for your snacking needs. This might be an unpopular opinion, since the Stacker has a fan following that was vocally upset when the item was discontinued in 2017. I suspect, though, that their enthusiasm for the thing might have had something to do with its original price tag of just a buck. At more than twice what it used to cost? They might prove to be fair-weather friends.\n\n3 Cheese Chicken Flatbread Melt\n\n$2.29 / 5 ounces\n\nOkay, I get that carbs are often the cheapest way to add heft to a menu item, but the thick, doughy blanket provided by the titular wrap is just too much. At the same time, it\u2019s not enough, since it offers no textural contrast to the soft fillings. Taco Bell\u2019s chicken \u2014 with a bit of pleasant chew, served here in thin strips \u2014 is an improvement over the beef, but again, there\u2019s an appearance by the chain\u2019s chipotle sauce and its faux-smoke redolence that would make me say pass (or at the very least swap in a different sauce).\n\nChicken Enchilada Burrito\n\n$2.49 / 7.25 ounces\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis combination of chicken, rice, cheese, sour cream and red sauce was another win for me. I started to suspect that the taco artists who prepared my order employed a very light hand with certain sauces, because as I found with the bean and cheese burrito, there didn\u2019t seem to be much red sauce. That would have added a welcome punch to the party. Another squeeze from a packet, though, and I got the balance I was looking for. Bonus: This burrito felt hefty enough in which to make a meal.\n\nLoaded Beef Nachos\n\n$2.99 / 11 ounces\n\nThis aptly named fella is, indeed, loaded, with chips heaped with refried beans, beef, nacho cheese, sour cream, red sauce and guacamole. I\u2019d advise eating this hot off the drive-through, because the base will quickly go soggy under all those accoutrements. And it goes without saying that this is definitely not a car-friendly dish, since it requires some deft scooping to manage. I was rightly suspicious of the guac, fearing that a fast-food version of my favorite dip would disappoint. It had a pleasant lime-forward flavor, but it suffered from a thinner consistency than the freshly mashed kind \u2014 and I found it creepy that the mixture showed no sign of browning hours after I purchased it. But if it\u2019s bang for your buck you\u2019re after, this chonky dish clocks in as a particularly good deal.\n\nCheesy Fiesta Potatoes\n\n$2.59 / 5.2 ounces\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not sure who, exactly, this petite bowl is for. People who really like forks? Those who insist upon a side item to go with their entrees? It\u2019s pretty simple, just cubes of potatoes topped with nacho cheese and sour cream \u2014 and pretty bland and beige.\n\nCheesy Double Beef Burrito\n\n$2.79 / 8.6 ounces"}

Right now, Memphis doesn\u2019t appear to have any, which is a big part of why the Tigers are among Division I\u2019s most puzzling free-falling teams. The stunners. The cheers. The home runs, hat tricks and gameday magic. Don\u2019t miss out with The Sports Moment, a newsletter for the biggest sports news. ArrowRight Coach Penny Hardaway\u2019s squad has dropped four in a row in American Athletic Conference play, its longest league losing streak since 2017. Memphis (15-6) hosts Wichita State on Saturday, and a setback against the 9-12 Shockers (who are tied for last in the American) would leave the Tigers with a five-game slide in conference play for the first time since 2000.\n\nBut would it really be a, ahem, shocker if Memphis falls its next time out after it stumbled at home against 8-13 Rice on Wednesday?\n\nMemphis isn\u2019t in the middle of a conventional slide. Sure, the other teams it lost to in late January are respectable. South Florida (14-5) has done fine work under first-year coach Amir Abdur-Rahim to match its victory total from all of last season. Tight losses such as a two-point setback at Tulane (12-8) happen from time to time. And UAB (14-7) has proven a tough out in its first year in the league.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even some of the Tigers\u2019 relatively recent victories \u2014 by two at home over SEC doormat Vanderbilt just before Christmas, in overtime at home against a defensively limited Texas San Antonio bunch, in giving up 86 points to a less-than-explosive Wichita State team \u2014 offered warnings.\n\nHardaway\u2019s teams have woven two elements into their success. There was a significant Memphis presence on the roster, a byproduct largely of his own ties to the city but also a strong provincialism about the program that reflects its place as the longtime center of the area\u2019s sports scene. And the Tigers made up for whatever they missed on the offensive end by defending with zeal.\n\nThey scored much more easily on the way to NCAA tournament berths the past two years but still defended well (if not quite at the elite level they achieved in 2019-20 and 2020-21). This season, the offense is decent but the defense has reached its lowest point in the six-year Hardaway era.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been especially poor of late, and while guard Caleb Mills\u2019s season-ending left knee injury last month is no help, it isn\u2019t a catchall explanation. Memphis is poor at denying second chances and is mediocre at defending the three-point line. Both have gotten worse of late (opponents are 41.1 percent from three over the past four games), but they weren\u2019t great to begin with.\n\nThis isn\u2019t like Villanova\u2019s five-game skid, which includes getting swept by Marquette, losing by a point to Connecticut and losing at St. John\u2019s. Those results make some sense. So does Nevada dropping four of five after it hit the teeth of the Mountain West schedule. The explanation for Michigan, which was lauded during a 3-0 start and is 4-14 since, is even easier. The Wolverines just aren\u2019t good.\n\nBut Memphis has a decent collection of victories. It won at Texas A&M and knocked off Clemson and Virginia, all in a three-game span in December. It also upended a handful of teams (Arkansas, Missouri and VCU) that haven\u2019t turned out to be as good as expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, it seems like Memphis isn\u2019t, either.\n\nGame on at South Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina appeared on few lists of potential surprise teams at the start of the season. The Gamecocks weren\u2019t good at much of anything while going 11-21 in Lamont Paris\u2019s first season in charge last year, and they were picked to finish last in the SEC\u2019s preseason poll.\n\nThings were bound to get a little better as Paris \u2014 a former Wisconsin assistant who took Chattanooga to the NCAA tournament in 2022 \u2014 established his plan. But heading into February with an 18-3 record that features victories over Kentucky and Tennessee? That\u2019s something else altogether.\n\nThe Gamecocks have four players averaging in double figures, including Meechie Johnson (15.1 points per game) and Wofford import B.J. Mack (14.0). They\u2019ve done that despite playing at the No. 349 adjusted tempo out of 362 teams, according to KenPom.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Carolina also just got Vanderbilt transfer Myles Stute back from a three-game absence, and he promptly scored 13 points with three made three-pointers against Tennessee on Wednesday.\n\nNational polls mean only so much, but it\u2019s hard to ignore first-time-in-a-long-time stats like the ones the Gamecocks have compiled. The 63-59 victory in Knoxville this week was the program\u2019s first on the road against a top-five team since toppling Kentucky in 1997. And South Carolina hadn\u2019t collected two top-10 wins in three games since winning at Duke and North Carolina in February 1968.\n\nWhether the Gamecocks have a deep run in them is far from certain. But they\u2019ve already matched their largest victory total since their 2017 Final Four appearance, they\u2019re defending the perimeter at a high level since the start of SEC play, and they\u2019ve won three road games in a row entering Saturday\u2019s visit to Georgia. Few may have seen South Carolina coming, but it is within a game of the SEC lead and far from finished this season.\n\nMid-major spotlight\n\nGreen Bay\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListening to Sundance Wicks\u2019s voice mail greeting offers a spot-on sense of Green Bay\u2019s first-year coach.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to bring your own juice,\u201d Wicks booms infectiously.\n\nHe sure doesn\u2019t.\n\nA man who peppers his conversation with quotations and pop culture references, who is adorned in a green-and-white plaid jacket in the photo on his bio page on the Phoenix\u2019s website and whose enthusiasm is palpable even on a phone call is presiding over one of the best turnarounds in Division I.\n\nGreen Bay has a long history of success. It was exceptional during a run in the 1990s under Dick Bennett, famously picking off Jason Kidd-led Cal in the first round of the 1994 NCAA tournament. But the past three years were rough under Will Ryan, leading to his firing in the middle of last season before a 3-29 finish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Wicks, who has the Phoenix at 15-9 overall after Thursday\u2019s 79-56 rout of IUPUI and has energized a vibrant fan base.\n\n\u201cThat whole community gets behind us,\u201d Wicks said. \u201cYou can kind of forget pretty fast where we were in the last three years at 16-71 to all of the sudden this year being 15-9, because they want to have that memory like a goldfish, like Ted Lasso says. You want to forget how it was the last three years.\u201d\n\nWicks, who had a two-year stint at Division II Missouri Western, spent the past three seasons as an assistant at Wyoming. It was there he got to know junior guard Noah Reynolds, who followed him to Green Bay.\n\nReynolds leads the Horizon League in both scoring (20.8 per game) and assists (5.1) in conference play, and his consistency provided a foundation for a team with 12 new players on a 15-man roster to acclimate. But he is far from the Phoenix\u2019s only option.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreshman David Douglas Jr. has three 20-point games in his past four outings. Forward Elijah Jones is shooting 62.7 percent, including 47.8 percent from three-point range. Green Bay has seven players averaging between 5.4 and 8.7 points.\n\n\u201cWe got Noah Reynolds and what I call the Crazy Eights,\u201d Wicks said. \u201cWe have eight guys who essentially play different roles for us that have scored in double figures. We\u2019re probably the hardest scout in America, because when you have eight guys that are playing different spots \u2014 starting, not starting \u2014 eight different guys who all scored 12 points in a game at some point this year, you\u2019re going to sit there and go, \u2018Who do we stop next?\u2019\u201d\n\nWicks credits players for committing to the Phoenix after it closed out last season at No. 361 (out of 363) in both the NET and the KenPom.com rankings. But beyond the boundless energy \u2014 \u201cjuice,\u201d in Wicks\u2019s parlance \u2014 is a coach who has figured out an ideal way to deploy his roster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe argues that if you don\u2019t have overwhelming talent, there are two ways for a team to separate itself in basketball today. One is to play fast/fast \u2014 running, jumping and trapping on defense, pushing the pace on offense. The other is slow/slow, which combines a defense making opponents feel like every possession is a trip to the dentist and a deliberate approach on offense.\n\nGreen Bay is definitely the latter, ranking 350th in KenPom\u2019s adjusted tempo metric. But the Phoenix is also third in Horizon League play in offensive efficiency, and it has distinguished itself as a team that shoots lots of threes (seventh nationally in percentage of field goal attempts beyond the arc) and makes plenty of them. Plus, Green Bay smothers opponents from the outside.\n\nIt\u2019s quite the homage to Bennett, whom Green Bay fans revere for taking the Phoenix to four NCAA tournaments from 1991 to 1996.\n\n\u201cThey actually really appreciate it,\u201d Wicks said. \u201cI make sure they\u2019re reminded we are playing Bennett basketball around here. The Green Bay way is gritty, not pretty. But what\u2019s funny is there\u2019s a little bit of the new-school twist that I\u2019ve kind of pulled the wool over their eyes a little bit in the sense of we shoot a lot of three-pointers. We\u2019re still grinding it out defensively, but we\u2019re going to have the pretty side of basketball, too.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the most beautiful part: At 10-3 in the Horizon League, Green Bay sits in first place with seven games to go. That should be enough to juice up any Phoenix supporter.\n\nWeekend highlights\n\nHouston at Kansas (Saturday, 4, ESPN): The Cougars (19-2, 6-2 Big 12) head to Allen Fieldhouse for the first time as a conference rival of the Jayhawks (17-4, 5-3), who thrashed Oklahoma State on Tuesday to bounce back from a loss at Iowa State. Kansas will be no worse than a half-game out of first in the Big 12 as it hits the midpoint of league play if it wins, and two behind Houston with a trip to face the Cougars still to come if it loses.\n\nDuke at North Carolina (Saturday, 6:30, ESPN): The host Tar Heels (17-4, 9-1 ACC) are coming off an unexpected loss at Georgia Tech as they head into their first showdown with the Blue Devils (16-4, 7-2). This game will feature the ACC\u2019s best guard (Carolina\u2019s RJ Davis) and its best big (Duke\u2019s Kyle Filipowski), and it\u2019s not hard to envision a big game helping either of them eventually land conference player of the year honors.\n\nIowa State at Baylor (Saturday, 8, ESPN2): Did Baylor (15-5, 4-3 Big 12) rediscover its footing by dispatching Central Florida this week to snap a three-game skid? Or were three losses by a combined nine points (and two in overtime) not worth getting worked up about in the first place. Beating the Cyclones (16-4, 5-2), who had a midweek open date, would help settle that question.\n\nTennessee at Kentucky (Saturday, 8:30, ESPN): This one lost a bit of its shine as the Volunteers (15-5, 5-2 SEC) lost at home to South Carolina on Tuesday and Kentucky (15-5, 5-3) stumbled in overtime against Florida at Rupp Arena a night later. But it\u2019s still one of the SEC\u2019s marquee games, and neither wants to be looking at a two-game slide in the middle of conference play.\n\nSaint Mary\u2019s at Gonzaga (Saturday, 10:30, ESPN): The first of (at least) two editions of the West Coast Conference\u2019s best rivalry unfolds at the Kennel, where Gonzaga (16-5, 7-1) has not lost to the Gaels (17-6, 8-0) since 2018. Given their skimpy r\u00e9sum\u00e9, the Bulldogs have plenty of work to do, and while other games loom larger (at Kentucky this month, the return trip to Saint Mary\u2019s and the WCC tournament), this would be a helpful victory."}

Professional and business services, which covers a range of white-collar jobs that had been hit hard by interest rate hikes, added 74,000 jobs in January, soaring past the sluggish average monthly gain of 14,000 jobs in 2023. Fueled by a rapidly aging baby boomer population, health care added 70,000 jobs, with the strongest gains in ambulatory health care, hospitals and nursing homes.\n\nRetail gained 45,000 new jobs, mostly at general merchandise retailers, and manufacturing added 23,000 jobs, though both industries have shown little overall change since early 2023. Government added 36,000 new roles, mostly in federal and local government, as wages have risen enough to keep up with the private sector.\n\n\u201cCorporate America hit the accelerator to meet the increase in demand,\u201d Brusuelas added. \u201cThe economy accelerated in the fourth quarter of the year. We\u2019re seeing a rational response by firms to meet that demand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAverage hourly wage growth accelerated sharply in January, rising by 0.6 percent, to $34.55 an hour, in part because higher paying industries boosted their payrolls after months of tepid growth. Over the past 12 months, hourly wages have risen by 4.5 percent, raising workers\u2019 standard of living, especially the lowest earners. Federal Reserve policymakers are closely watching wages, hoping to see more moderated wage growth as a sign that inflation is under control.\n\nThe strong labor market report will get a close review at the Fed, where policymakers are trying to pinpoint the right time to lower interest rates for the first time since 2020.

At a news conference this week, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said officials need a bit more time to be completely sure that inflation will keep trending down.\n\n\u201cWe look at stronger growth. We don\u2019t look at it as a problem. I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth,\u201d Powell said during a news conference. \u201cWe want to see a strong labor market.

Last week, the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose to an 11-week high. Amazon, Microsoft, Google and many other tech companies said they will cut tens of thousands of jobs this year, and retailers such as Macy\u2019s and REI have announced workforce reductions. UPS also announced about 12,000 layoffs this week, as the transportation and warehousing industry has reversed some of the massive expansion experienced during its pandemic e-commerce boom. Layoffs more than doubled between December and January, from 34,817 to 82,307, according to employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut economists aren\u2019t concerned about layoffs concentrated in a few industries triggering a broader meltdown. Layoffs are still trending below their pre-pandemic levels, according to data released by the Labor Department on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIn this low-unemployment environment, most of the laid-off workers will likely manage to find new jobs fairly quickly,\u201d said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. \u201cWhile some individual workers may struggle to find comparable work, the layoffs are unlikely to have an effect in the aggregate.\u201d\n\nLast year the public sector, which includes education, caught up with its pre-pandemic employment levels, after struggling for years with an understaffing crisis. More robust pay and benefits packages have made those jobs more attractive to workers.\n\nLindsey Rogers, 27, and her husband, Jared, public school teachers in Baker City, Ore., saw their household income double at the start of this school year, rising by around $48,000, because of mandated salary increases in their new union contract.

The cheers. The home runs, hat tricks and gameday magic. Don\u2019t miss out with The Sports Moment, a newsletter for the biggest sports news. ArrowRight But for the most part, the backlash to the allegations have focused on Hockey Canada and the culture of junior hockey there. The NHL, the game\u2019s biggest stage, had largely avoided it \u2014 until now.\n\nMore than five years after a woman accused members of the Canadian junior team of sexual assault, four active NHL players and one former NHL player now in Europe left their professional teams and reported to London, Ontario, this week to face criminal charges. Their identities, shrouded for years, were made public, and police are expected to hold a news conference Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael McLeod, a center for the New Jersey Devils, and his teammate, defenseman Cal Foote, turned themselves in, along with Philadelphia Flyers goalie Carter Hart and Calgary Flames forward Dillon Dub\u00e9. The fifth player, winger Alex Formenton, plays in Switzerland, though his NHL rights are owned by the Ottawa Senators. All five players were granted leaves of absence from their teams; the Flames initially cited Dub\u00e9's absence as being for mental health reasons.\n\nThrough their attorneys, the players all denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe charges are the culmination of a scandal that has built in Canada for more than five years, with media attention and a growing political firestorm seemingly forcing police and prosecutors to revisit sexual assault allegations they had previously shelved \u2014 and which appear to have been virtually ignored until now by the NHL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spokesperson for the NHL, which hosts its All-Star Game this weekend in Toronto, said Tuesday the league had no comment \u201cat this time.\u201d The league and its clubs haven\u2019t said when they learned the names of the players charged.\n\nBut Amos Guiora, a law professor at the University of Utah and former chair of the Gymnastics Canada Task Force for Assault, said it was unlikely that team and league officials were unaware of rumors connecting these players to the allegations. \u201cI think they made a cold calculation that the fan base will tolerate this if he\u2019s able to put a puck in the net,\u201d Guiora said.\n\nA quiet settlement\n\nAll five of the players were part of the 2018 Canadian world junior team that won gold at that year\u2019s World Junior Championships, an annual showcase of potential NHL talent. That summer, members of the team attended a Hockey Canada fundraiser in London, where they were honored for their title.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was at a bar in London, the woman later claimed in her lawsuit, that she met one of the junior hockey players and returned to his hotel room, where they had consensual sex. Afterward, the woman claimed, \u201cseven or eight\u201d of the hockey players\u2019 friends arrived in the room and sexually assaulted her. The lawsuit doesn\u2019t name the woman or the players; The Washington Post doesn\u2019t typically identify alleged victims of sexual assault unless they ask to be named.\n\nThe woman\u2019s family reported the alleged sexual assault the next morning to Hockey Canada, which then notified the London police, according to later testimony in the Canadian Parliament. But both entities were apparently stymied by the task of even identifying the alleged perpetrators. Hockey Canada initially took no action, and the police closed their investigation in February 2019 without filing charges. The allegations did not become public.\n\nBy the time of the alleged assault, in June 2018, all five players had been drafted by their respective NHL teams. One, Formenton, had already made his NHL debut. It\u2019s common for players to require a year or two of development before becoming contributors, and McLeod, Hart and Dub\u00e9 all played in the NHL in the 2018-19 season. Foote began his professional career with Syracuse of the American Hockey League, one level below the NHL, in 2018 and made his NHL debut in January 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations erupted into view in May 2022 when a Canadian outlet reported that Hockey Canada had settled a multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed by a woman who alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by eight unnamed players from the 2018 world junior team. Hockey Canada reportedly used funds from a secret account bankrolled by registration fees from its members to settle the suit on behalf of all defendants \u2014 including hockey players whose identities it purported not to know.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe ensuing outcry and pressure from Canadian Parliament led to both Hockey Canada and police in London reopening investigations into the incident, eventually leading to charges.\n\nThe Senators did not re-sign Formenton, who instead signed with Swiss club Ambri-Piotta. At the time of the signing, the Swiss club acknowledged that Formenton was a member of the national junior hockey team under scrutiny. \u201cShould the new investigation by the Canadian police reveal elements that are currently unknown,\u201d the team said, \u201cthe club and the player have reserved the right to reevaluate their contractual relationship.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the other members of the 2018 juniors team returned to their NHL cities for training camp that fall. Many of them \u2014 including Dub\u00e9 and Foote \u2014 issued statements denying their involvement. The NHL also opened an investigation, which Commissioner Gary Bettman recently said is ongoing.\n\n\u201cThe process is continuing and we\u2019re trying to bring it to a conclusion; it\u2019s complicated, it hasn\u2019t been easy for a whole host of reasons,\u2019\u2019 Bettman said in December. \u201cBut we\u2019re continuing to progress on the process.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018Reasonable grounds\u2019\n\nAfter reopening the investigation, London police said in December 2022 that they had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe five players committed sexual assault. They asked a court to approve additional investigative measures, including search warrants to access the hotel room and thumb drives that contained text messages between the players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NHL\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with its players gives the commissioner the power to suspend players pending a criminal investigation in situations in which a failure to do so \u201cwould create a substantial risk of material harm to the legitimate interests and/or reputation of the League.\u201d But while allegations remained under investigation by the NHL, Hockey Canada and London police, the players were not publicly identified and kept playing.\n\nDub\u00e9 was the first to leave the ice, taking a leave of absence from the Flames on Jan. 21. In a statement Tuesday, after news broke that he was among the players charged, the Flames said they had \u201cno knowledge of pending charges\u201d when Dub\u00e9 made the request.\n\n\u201cWe take this matter very seriously,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cBecause the matter is now pending legal proceedings, we will have no further comment at this time. We had no knowledge of pending charges at the time Dillon\u2019s request for a leave of absence was granted.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Flyers granted Hart a leave of absence Jan. 23, citing personal reasons. When Flyers General Manager Daniel Briere met with the media the next day, after the Globe and Mail\u2019s report came out, he read a prepared statement.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of this morning\u2019s press reports of a very serious matter. We will respond appropriately when the outcomes of the investigations are made public,\u201d Briere said Jan. 24. \u201cThe NHL has been very clear that teams should refer all investigation-related questions to them. In the meantime, members of the organization, including Flyers players, will not be commenting further.\u201d\n\nMcLeod and Foote were both granted leaves of absence from the Devils on Jan. 24. Formenton\u2019s team in Switzerland released a statement on Jan. 24 saying that Formenton had been granted a leave of absence and allowed to return to Canada.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael McCann, director of the Sports and Entertainment Law Institute at the University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of Law, said that the NHL acted as expected given that the players had not been publicly identified. \u201cWithout knowing who the names of the players are, its hard to have an expectation to take action,\u201d McCann said.\n\nBut Rita Smith, a senior adviser to the NFL on issues related to domestic violence and sexual assault, said that she found it unlikely that the players\u2019 employers would be in the dark about the allegations. \u201cWhether they were publicly identified or not, the teams themselves should have heard about it,\u201d Smith said, adding that those teams then had an obligation to inform the league. \u201cThe reality is that if they could avoid it or ignore it I think most of the leagues would do that because it creates real conflict to take action.\u201d\n\nSmith said that sports leagues nonetheless have an obligation to conduct their own investigations and take action without waiting for cover from law enforcement. \u201cDomestic violence and sexual assault are highly unreported and rarely prosecuted, and so you can\u2019t wait for the criminal justice system to figure this out,\u201d Smith said.\n\nBut the NHL is under less scrutiny than the NFL, at least in the United States. And the cultural hold of hockey over Canadians could help explain the culture of silence, said Guiora, the Utah law professor."}

The Wildcats women had never sold out cozy Welsh-Ryan Arena, so the availability of tickets to a game 3\u00bd months off for a program that had been to the NCAA tournament twice in the past quarter century hardly merited a mention.\n\nOn Oct. 25, those tickets \u2014 mostly general admission, with no assigned seats \u2014 sold out. And on Wednesday \u2014 the day Northwestern hosted Iowa \u2014 fans began lining up at 10 a.m. By that point, the cheapest ticket available for resale on Ticketmaster was $243. The line eventually curled more than halfway around the building.\n\nThis is the Caitlin Clark effect, and college basketball has rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 seen anything like it. On Saturday night, the Hawkeyes guard comes to Maryland, where the Terrapins will try to limit the player who leads the nation in both scoring and infatuation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStart with the latter because the fact that Clark almost certainly will finish her career as the NCAA\u2019s all-time leading scorer is secondary to the impact she\u2019s having on her sport. Northwestern\u2019s experience as a host is hardly unique. Xfinity Center, Maryland\u2019s home arena, will be sold out for just the fourth time for a women\u2019s game in its 22-season history. Yeah, Iowa is coming off a Final Four appearance, is 20-2 and ranked third in the country. But that\u2019s not the reason this game sold out all 17,950 tickets \u2014 in December.\n\nLive look at the line outside of Welsh-Ryan Arena two hours before Caitlin Clark and the Iowa Hawkeyes tip off against Northwestern.\n\n\n\nFolks are wrapped halfway around the building. pic.twitter.com/2VOvjtbQvY \u2014 Julia Poe, on strike \u270a\ud83c\udffb (@byjuliapoe) January 31, 2024\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never really seen this around one player,\u201d said Rose DiPaula, Maryland\u2019s director of strategic communications, who has worked closely with the Terrapins women\u2019s program for more than a decade. \u201cTeams, maybe. But this is different.\u201d\n\nCheck out the impact. On Jan. 2, 3,263 loyal Purdue fans filed into Mackey Arena to watch the Boilermakers women host Rutgers. Eight days later, Clark and the Hawkeyes arrived for the next home game, and the crowd of 14,876 blew past Mackey\u2019s listed capacity \u2014 the fourth sellout in program history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis after Iowa ushered 55,656 folks into its football stadium to watch the women play an exhibition before the season started. This after 15,196 fans came close to filling an NBA arena in Charlotte \u2014 more than 900 miles from Iowa City \u2014 for a neutral-site game against fellow Final Four participant Virginia Tech. This in the midst of a season in which all of the Hawkeyes\u2019 Big Ten games, home and away, have been sellouts.\n\nSo what precedes Clark\u2019s visit to College Park is not mere hype. Clark justifies it all with her play. There is good reason that tickets for Saturday\u2019s matchup were available on the resale site SeatGeek for $86 (just two, and they\u2019re gone by now) while the same site offers tickets to Maryland\u2019s next home game, against Penn State on Feb. 18, for $4.\n\nShe has game. She has game for days. What is analogous in college basketball history \u2014 men or women? Stephen Curry at Davidson? Eh, maybe. The Fab Five at Michigan? That was a group effort. Same for the Connecticut women during their 111-game winning streak \u2014 a streak that included a win in December 2016 at Maryland, the Terps women\u2019s most recent sellout.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s just something visceral to how Clark plays and what she\u2019s doing. There\u2019s no 2024 sports highlight I have watched more than Clark nailing a buzzer-beater to top Michigan State back on Jan. 2. I realize it\u2019s early in the year, but it could be February 2025, and I might say the same thing.\n\nAnd in all honesty, \u201cnailing a buzzer-beater\u201d does the exchange a disservice. The score was tied when Iowa put the ball in play with just more than 20 seconds left. The announcers on NBC\u2019s streaming service, Peacock \u2014 yes, all of Iowa\u2019s Big Ten games are available to a national audience \u2014 began the call by saying, \u201cIowa\u2019s just got to let Caitlin Clark be Caitlin Clark.\u201d\n\nWhat that meant, in this instance: guard Molly Davis, working the ball to forward Hannah Stuelke on the three-point arc, her back to the basket. Clark, cutting to her right to get open to receive a pass, then pump faking, then sliding to her left and back. When she launched her 20th three-pointer of the night, both of her feet were on the Hawkeyes logo that spans midcourt. When it went through for points 38, 39 and 40 of the game, she ran with her arms extended away from her teammates and toward the Iowa crowd, her shoulders shrugged as if to say, \u201cWhat else did you expect?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat else would we expect? It is a special trait in an athlete to be able to handle such scrutiny \u2014 from an opposing defense or an opposing crowd \u2014 and manage it so sublimely. At a time when women\u2019s college basketball is rife with stars \u2014 LSU\u2019s Angel Reese and Connecticut\u2019s Paige Bueckers foremost among them \u2014 Clark is playing a different game.\n\nTo wit: Clark\u2019s average of 32.1 points per game through Wednesday was more than six points higher than her next closest pursuer (USC\u2019s JuJu Watkins at 25.8.) That difference between Clark and Watkins \u2014 6.3 points \u2014 matches the difference between Watkins and West Virginia\u2019s Ja\u2019Naiya Quinerly and UNLV\u2019s Desi-Rae Young \u2014 26 spots down the national scoring list. She makes a best-in-the-nation 5.23 three-pointers a game, a full three-pointer more than anyone else.\n\nAgainst Northwestern, she passed both Missouri State\u2019s Jackie Stiles and Ohio State\u2019s Kelsey Mitchell to move into second place on the NCAA Division I all-time scoring list. She finished with 35, her fifth straight 30-point game. That pushed her career total to 3,424 points, 103 off the mark set by former Washington star Kelsey Plum."}

Whatever its outcome, the salacious allegations have already given Trump ammunition for attacks aimed at discrediting the prosecution. \u201cWhen is Fani going to drop the case,\u201d he asked on social media, \u201cor should it be dropped for her?\u201d\n\nRoman\u2019s defense attorney, Ashleigh Merchant, told The Post in a brief exchange that she, rather than her client, unearthed the information that underpins the claims against Willis and Wade. Roman has embraced the move: When fellow conservative operatives wrote on X that Roman was \u201cthe guy who busted Fani Willis\u201d and that his 127-page court filing was \u201can object lesson in why you don\u2019t indict the oppo guy,\u201d he clicked like on the posts.\n\nOver a career as a political operative and investigator, including for the conservative Koch brothers\u2019 network, he has been described as intensely private and driven in his work. He has hired former CIA analysts to train his staff, arranged for drones to surveil campaign rallies and used military terminology, according to former colleagues. While working for Trump in 2020, he recruited poll-watchers for what the campaign called the \u201cArmy for Trump,\u201d oversaw election-day operations and played a key role in organizing the \u201calternate elector plan\u201d that is central to the charges in Fulton County, records show.\n\nMerchant declined to answer detailed questions for this article. Roman did not respond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoman, 52, climbed to the upper echelons of Republican politics from hardscrabble beginnings in North Philadelphia, in a strongly Catholic blue-collar neighborhood within the city\u2019s so-called \u201cBadlands.\u201d\n\n\u201cMike\u2019s got street smarts,\u201d Philadelphia lawyer Bruce S. Marks, a friend of Roman\u2019s for more than 30 years, told The Post in 2020. \u201cHe\u2019s not some Ivy League guy with a bow-tie.\u201d\n\nRoman got a break in politics in 1993 knocking on doors for Marks\u2019s Republican campaign for the Pennsylvania state Senate. Marks appeared to lose in a close race, but overturned the result in federal court by proving that his Democratic opponent benefited from fraudulent absentee ballots. The case caused Roman to fixate on voter fraud years before it became central to Republican politics.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I was just absolutely hooked on election security, and I\u2019ve been doing that ever since,\u201d Roman said at the March 2022 event in Harrisburg, held by the Conservative Partnership Institute. A recording of it was obtained by Documented, a liberal-leaning watchdog group, which shared it with The Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy 2000, Roman was working for the Pennsylvania Republican Party. Michael DuHaime, a veteran GOP consultant who got to know Roman 20 years ago, said Roman\u2019s upbringing as a Republican in Philadelphia\u2019s bare-knuckle ward politics, historically dominated by Democrats, made him extraordinarily suspicious of Election Day chicanery.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s tough as nails,\u201d said DuHaime. \u201cHe was content to not be super well-known, and he didn\u2019t do the networking that a lot of people do.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Roman launched an independent website dedicated to exposing election \u201cfraud, cheating and dirty tricks.\u201d A video he published showing members of the New Black Panther party outside a Philadelphia polling place, one holding a billy club, was picked up by Fox News and sparked a years-long controversy.\n\nDuring the 2008 campaign, Roman worked for the presidential campaigns of former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). The campaigns paid him and a small consulting firm he had formed a total of more than $142,000 in pay and expenses, according to campaign finance reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround that time, Roman was sued several times over small debts, court records show. As the global economy collapsed, Roman and his partner, Adrienne McAllister, fell behind on repaying their mortgage. In July 2009, their lender moved to foreclose on their modest Philadelphia house.\n\nTwo months later, McAllister filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows a filer to repay debts through monthly installments and can protect against foreclosure. McAllister reported in her bankruptcy filings that she and Roman owed more than $12,400 in overdue mortgage payments and that she owed thousands in other debts. She would file for bankruptcy four more times over the next decade, even as Roman in some years received six-figure incomes.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nMcAllister did not respond to questions.\n\nRoman and McAllister have seven children together, according to court records and social media posts. They have long referred to each other online and to some friends as husband and wife. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re married,\u201d Marks said. \u201cNo, I did not go to the wedding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut across her five bankruptcy petitions, McAllister described Roman as her \u201clive-in boyfriend\u201d or the father of her children, and wrote that he contributed between $2,100 and $5,500 per month to help cover household expenses. Roman would later give his marital status as \u201csingle\u201d to the Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office when he was booked on the charges in Georgia. The Post was unable to find any official record suggesting that they ever wed.\n\nIf they were married, McAllister would have been required to disclose Roman\u2019s income in her bankruptcy filing and to pay more each month toward her debts, according to bankruptcy attorneys.\n\nAround the time of McAllister\u2019s first bankruptcy proceeding, Roman began working for the Public Engagement Group Trust, a little-known firm in Arlington, Va., that said it aimed to raise public awareness of government spending and free markets. Its tax returns show that Roman was paid $180,000 between July 2011 and June 2013 to work as trustee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trust was part of a network of conservative nonprofits backed by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, The Post has previously reported. In November 2013, according to disclosure forms he later filed as a Trump appointee, Roman switched to a higher-profile arm of the Kochs\u2019 political empire: Freedom Partners, a conservative political advocacy giant, which in the previous year had reported revenue of $255 million. He served as vice president of research, earning $286,377 in 2014, according to the organization\u2019s tax return.\n\nThe bland job title belied the aggressive purpose of the unit he led, which Politico dubbed \u201cthe Koch intelligence agency.\u201d\n\nRoman\u2019s unit compiled a \u201cWeekly Intelligence Briefing,\u201d with information about political races and recommendations about where the network\u2019s donors should contribute, according to a person who worked there with Roman and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the organization\u2019s internal operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoman was instructed by the Koch network\u2019s leadership to keep the unit under wraps and seemed to relish the task, the person said. \u201cHe was like, \u2018If you want us to be secretive, we\u2019ll be secretive.\u2019\u201d\n\nFreedom Partners was later folded into other parts of the Koch network. In response to questions from The Post about Roman\u2019s work, a network spokesman said that \u201cthe department carried out standard policy and political research that you typically see in campaigns.\u201d\n\nRoman insisted on housing the unit, which grew to about two dozen people, in a windowless office near the Koch network\u2019s main offices in Arlington, the person said. There, Roman became suspicious that an environmental group with an office on the same floor might be monitoring them, the person added. Roman researched the group but found nothing to substantiate his suspicions, according to the person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMike wasn\u2019t afraid about being aggressive,\u201d the person said, adding that Roman\u2019s concern was partly justified because left-leaning advocacy groups routinely tried to dig up damaging information about the Koch network.\n\nMembers of Roman\u2019s unit were also tasked with attending donor retreats to make sure that liberal activists did not infiltrate the gatherings and that no sensitive documents were left behind, the person said.\n\nRoman brought in former CIA analysts to train the team, the person said, and purchased a drone the unit used to surveil political rallies in Virginia\u2019s 2013 gubernatorial race.\n\nIn 2016, Roman worked for Trump\u2019s long-shot presidential campaign, overseeing volunteers who observed at the polls on Election Day to look for irregularities. When Trump won, Roman joined the transition team.\n\nRoman was made a special assistant to the president and White House director of special projects and research, reporting to then-White House counsel Donald McGahn and earning $115,000 per year. Roman was a private investigator of sorts for McGahn\u2019s office, responsible for vetting potentially controversial nominations, according to a former senior administration official.\n\n\u201cIt would be like, \u2018We\u2019ve heard an appointee might have a shady business deal,\u2019 or \u2018Counsel is hearing something about a presidential nominee that could cause a huge problem for us. Can you figure it out?\u2019\u201d the former official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive White House work.\n\nAs he joined the White House in January 2017, Roman reported to government ethics regulators that he had received more than $505,000 in pay and severance for his work at Freedom Partners and as a political consultant during 2016.\n\nEleven days after he signed his ethics report, Roman also signed an official declaration that he and McAllister were \u201cexperiencing a financial hardship.\u201d The declaration, part of an application to an Obama-era federal program to help struggling homeowners, was submitted in one of McAllister\u2019s bankruptcies. The couple secured a reduced interest rate and a lengthened 40-year repayment period, according to another document filed in that bankruptcy, but the couple\u2019s lender eventually succeeded in foreclosing on their house and sold it.\n\nFor the 2020 election campaign, Roman was responsible for Trump election integrity efforts. He was charged with recruiting thousands of poll watchers and ensuring that a network of pro-Trump lawyers were ready to sue state authorities, a former senior campaign official said.\n\n\u201cWe had 50,000 volunteers signed up and trained, 10,000 lawyers that had been recruited,\u201d the former campaign official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly for the campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s the best Republicans have ever done on this by multitudes.\u201d\n\nAs director of Election Day operations, Roman scooped up intelligence from his network of observers around the nation, hunting for reports of irregularities. He warned in a September 2020 radio interview that far-left activists could destroy Trump ballots, and he stoked claims of fraud in Election Day tweets about Democrats in Philadelphia. \u201cThey are stealing it,\u201d he wrote in one post.\n\nAfter Trump lost in 2020, Roman was deeply involved in the president\u2019s efforts to overturn the result, participating in activities that Georgia prosecutors allege amounted to racketeering.\n\nWorking alongside some of Trump\u2019s lawyers and top aides, Roman helped coordinate the alternate elector plan in which Republicans in states Biden won signed official-looking paperwork purporting to cast electoral college votes for Trump instead. Emails circulated by Roman about the plan, including a detailed spreadsheet tracking the effort in several states, were later published by the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. When asked in a committee interview about his post-election activities, Roman repeatedly invoked his rights under the Fifth Amendment, which protects against self-incrimination.\n\nIn Fulton County, Roman is charged with seven counts, including conspiring to impersonate a public officer, to commit first-degree forgery and to file false documents. Following his indictment in August, he organized an online fundraising campaign to pay for his defense against what he described as the \u201chighly partisan, media hungry District Attorney.\u201d So far he has raised $59,000 toward a goal of $300,000.\n\nGoing on the offense against the prosecutor was a trademark Roman tactic, according to the former senior official on Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign. \u201cThis is a classic Mike Roman move,\u201d the former official said. \u201cWhen I saw the filing, I said, \u2018That\u2019s Mike.\u2019 It\u2019s a good one.\u201d"}

We asked 14 centenarians from around the world to reflect on what it takes to live a healthy and happy life, and to share the advice they would have given to their younger selves. Here\u2019s what they said. Advertisement Choose the right life partner Leonard Samuel \u2018Sam\u2019 Baker, 101 Location: Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nLeonard Samuel \u201cSam\u201d Baker, 101, is a World War II veteran who had a nearly four-decade career in government. He\u2019s retired, but hasn\u2019t stopped working: He writes children\u2019s books and received a patent for a football helmet he developed to reduce concussion risks. But of all the things he\u2019s done, he said, one of the best was \u201cmarrying Janet.\u201d His advice: Choose the right partner and appreciate the time you have.\n\nBaker lives in Scottsdale, Ariz. He met his wife in Sacramento in 1954. Janet was \u201ca perfect soul mate,\u201d he said. She was calming and always gave good advice.\n\nBaker served for decades at the federal agency that established and maintained the national coordinate system, a precursor to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. When his career required him to move, Janet moved with him \u2014 seven times in the first year of their marriage. She \u201cnever complained,\u201d Baker said \u2014 even when he had to spend up to seven months at sea, and she and their children had to stay behind.\n\n\u201cI kept asking myself for a long time, \u2018Did I ever tell her enough times how much I loved her?\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Leonard Samuel \u201cSam\u201d Baker Janet died of a heart valve condition at 88. \u201cI was lost for a while\u201d after that, Baker said. \u201cI kept asking myself for a long time, \u2018Did I ever tell her enough times how much I loved her?\u2019\u201d It took him years to process his grief. \u201cYou have had these 50-some ... years of togetherness, closeness. And suddenly, it\u2019s taken away from you,\u201d he said. But he realized he was \u201cstill whole, and God still had plans for me.\u201d New hobbies and pursuits keep his mind engaged. And, he said, it\u2019s good to have goals. He wants to live to 105 because he wants \u201cto try to solve the water problem in Arizona, and it will take until 105 to do it.\u201d His life feels \u201cfull,\u201d though there is always \u201csomething missing,\u201d he said. \u201cJanet isn\u2019t here to enjoy it with me.\u201d Do what you love\n\nShitsui Hakoishi, 107\n\nLocation: Nakagawa, Japan\n\nAt 107, Shitsui Hakoishi is determined to claim a Guinness World Record. \u201cThe title for oldest barber in the world is currently 108 years old, so I need to work until I\u2019m 109,\u201d she said.\n\nHakoishi moved from a rural town in Tochigi prefecture to Tokyo at the age of 14 to train as a barber, a male-dominated industry at the time. She received her license at 19 years old, on what she called the \u201chappiest day of my life.\u201d Not long after, she experienced the saddest \u2014 when her husband was killed fighting in World War II. She moved back to the countryside of Tochigi prefecture, to the town of Nakagawa, and opened her own barber shop, which she still runs today. She devoted her life to cutting hair.\n\nThe key to a long life, Hakoishi said, is a career that fills you with joy. \u201cMy job is my passion,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery day is a blessing.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about her younger self, Hakoishi said: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of her. She worked hard. But I wish I could tell her to eat well and take better care of herself.\u201d\n\nShe credits her ongoing health to tea that she makes out of dried Japanese ginger, dayflowers and thistle. She drinks three cups with every meal. In 2021, Hakoishi carried the torch for 1.3 miles as part of the relay for the flame-lighting ceremony at the Tokyo Olympic Games, an accomplishment that fills her with pride.\n\n\u201cI have always told my children: Don\u2019t get angry, don\u2019t hate, don\u2019t envy,\u201d she said. \u201cI have always lived by these words.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t neglect your education\n\nQueenie Evelyn \u2018Robbie\u2019 Hall, 100\n\nLocation: Stowmarket, Suffolk, Britain\n\nWhen Robbie Hall thinks back on her 100 years on Earth, she has one main regret. \u201cI wish I had had a decent education,\u201d Hall, of Stowmarket, England, said. She would tell her younger self: \u201cGet yourself a decent education. And then you can\u2019t go wrong.\u201d\n\nHall grew up in southeast England during the Great Depression. When Hall turned 14 \u2014 then the legal age when children could leave school \u2014 her aunt offered to pay for her to attend secretarial college. But Hall would have to pay the bus fare. \u201cI knew how hard-up things were,\u201d she said. Though Hall \u201cloved school,\u201d she left. The chance to earn a living working at a boarding school felt like her best option.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I wanted was pocket money,\u201d she recalled. Her mother washed other families\u2019 clothing to feed Hall and her five siblings. After losing his factory job, Hall\u2019s father received government unemployment benefits.\n\nToday, Hall wishes she had made a different choice \u2014 and stresses to everyone, but particularly women and girls, the importance of pursuing an education. For her, it\u2019s not just about the crucial skills you learn, but the ease with which educated people can move through society, even when they come from humble upbringings. Hall has passed up other opportunities in her life because \u201calways, at the back of things, I feel my lack of education,\u201d she said. \u201cStudy well, study hard.\u201d\n\nStay true to your principles\n\nBikram Singh Grewal, 100\n\nLocation: Chandigarh, Punjab, India\n\nBikram Singh Grewal started his career as a government engineer around the time India and Pakistan became independent states, when he was in his early 20s. \u201cHold your ground in being principled,\u201d was his advice to his three children \u2014 even if there are consequences to standing up for what\u2019s right.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much money or wealth you have accumulated,\u201d said Grewal, in an interview from his home in Chandigarh, India, before he died on Jan. 31 at the age of 100. \u201cThe true hallmark of success is performing your professional duties diligently and honestly.\u201d\n\nIn his personal life, too, Grewal followed a strict discipline in his diet and exercise routine. He ate five fruits and five vegetables everyday and played golf till the age of 93. \u201cI believe it is a combination of a good diet, exercise and a fixed sleep schedule that can help anyone in reaching the age of 100,\u201d he said.\n\nLearn tolerance\n\nColin Bell, 102\n\nLocation: Sidcup, Greater London\n\nColin Bell \u2014 who was married for 73 years \u2014 has learned the importance of patience and a sense of humor in his 102 years. But these virtues didn\u2019t come as easily in his 20s when he and his wife, Kathlyn, had children. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand the importance of kindness and tolerance at that age,\u201d said Bell, who lives in southeast London. \u201cI like to think that I\u2019ve developed it since.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand the importance of kindness and tolerance at that age. I like to think that I\u2019ve developed it since.\u201d \u2014 Colin Bell He now wishes he could tell that younger self to \u201cbe kind\u201d and \u201cmore tolerant,\u201d particularly of his two children. Bell said serving in the Royal Air Force during World War II affected him as a father in ways he has come to regret. The military was a \u201charsh and unyielding\u201d environment, he recalled. Upon leaving active service when the war ended, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I brought that attitude into my home,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time I became a grandfather \u2026 I had learned tolerance, I had learned kindness,\u201d he said. \u201cMy lovely Kath was my tutor because she was an incredibly kind and tolerant woman. \u2026 I think over the years it rubbed off on me.\u201d Cherish your friendships\n\nMadeline Paldo, 101\n\nLocation: River Grove, Ill.\n\nAt age 101, Madeline Paldo finds it remarkable that she still has friends. They come over for lunch, including a friend of 60 years, AnnLeola Gervasio. \u201cThere\u2019s always action over here,\u201d said Paldo, of River Grove, Ill., a suburb of Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s like a swinging door.\u201d\n\nWhen Paldo and her husband were raising their two sons, they would meet once a month with seven other couples who lived around Chicago. They called the group \u201cClub 14.\u201d The couples would visit each other\u2019s houses to chat; some would play pinochle, a card game. \u201cYou could just stop in and visit,\u201d Paldo said. \u201cEverybody had their doors open. They had the pot of coffee on all the time. You could stop by anybody. But today you can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nClub 14 got smaller as the group got older. Gervasio and Paldo are the only two from the club who are still alive. Paldo\u2019s husband died in 1991. Her advice: \u201cEnjoy your friends while you have them,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a few through the years but the ones I\u2019ve got, I cherish.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink positive\n\nPearl Taylor, 103\n\nLocation: Dayton, Ohio\n\nPearl Taylor was 39, with 10- and 13-year-old sons, when her first husband left her. She recalls sitting on her bed, \u201cvery upset and depressed,\u201d when she found a forgotten gift from a friend: \u201cThe Game of Life and How to Play It,\u201d a guide to spiritual philosophy and positive thinking by Florence Scovel Shinn.\n\nIn those days, \u201cpeople did not divorce. Whatever happened, we would stay with our partner,\u201d said Taylor, from her home in Dayton, Ohio. The philosophy in the book \u2014 which, at 103, she still reads from every day \u2014 taught her \u201cEverything in our life, our whole life \u2014 we create it\u201d and to believe in the importance of self-worth, she said.\n\n\u201cEverything in our life \u2014 we create it.\u201d \u2014 Pearl Taylor Taylor, who was born in Cuba, and raised in Kingston, Jamaica, moved to the United States in 1947 and was a factory worker at a tire company for 25 years. Last year, Taylor started sharing life lessons on TikTok, with the help of her granddaughter. \u201cThe mind is very, very powerful,\u201d Taylor says in a video that\u2019s been viewed more than 900,000 times. \u201cWhatever thought you think, good or bad, it\u2019s coming from your mind. And, so, it materializes.\u201d Learn from your elders\n\nMar\u00eda Ambrocia Ruiz Guti\u00e9rrez, 101\n\nLocation: Santa Cruz, Guanacaste, Costa Rica\n\nMar\u00eda Ambrocia Ruiz Guti\u00e9rrez, 101, grew up on her family\u2019s farm in Santa Cruz, in Costa Rica\u2019s Guanacaste province, where her parents \u2014 and eight siblings \u2014 guided her. \u201cMy viejitos were very good,\u201d Ruiz said, referring to her parents. Her advice: Learn by watching and listening to elders and others who love and support you.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nHer father taught her to work the land, help with the vegetable garden, ride horses and tend to the cattle, pigs and chickens. Ruiz remembers her mother as caring and hard-working, making sure the children had nice clothes, which she would sew, and notebooks for school. \u201cWhen we went out, she would tell us, \u2018May God be with you, my little children. Behave well, don\u2019t hurt anyone so that they don\u2019t bother you,\u2019\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want us to be spoiled.\u201d\n\nRuiz cleaned people\u2019s homes, worked on farms and, until recently, created and sewed dresses for traditional Guanacaste dancers.\n\nRuiz, who still lives in Santa Cruz, now has her own large family. A single parent to 10 children for most of her life, she\u2019s a grandmother of 22, great-grandmother of 24, and great-great-grandmother of six.\n\nBelieve in your own potential\n\nMildred \u2018Milly\u2019 Skjordahl, 110\n\nLocation: Tucson\n\nWhen Milly Skjordahl was young, her father told her that she could do anything he could \u2014 as long as she worked hard. Skjordahl, who got her first job at 14, said she always did. But she lacked confidence and passed up opportunities because she didn\u2019t think she was \u201cgood enough.\u201d\n\nNow 110, Skjordahl wishes she could tell her younger self to believe in herself. \u201cI didn\u2019t have self-confidence, but I should have had it,\u201d she said. \u201cIn retrospect, I could have done almost anything.\u201d\n\nSkjordahl was born in 1913 in Hammond, Ind., in a poor family. She \u201ccouldn\u2019t wait\u201d to work, she said. During school holidays, she worked in a grocery store, where she made about 25 cents (less than $4.50 today) an hour. She gave most of her paycheck to her parents and kept a small amount for pocket money. At 16, Skjordahl graduated high school. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the money to go to college,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was just a dream.\u201d\n\nShe went on to work at the bicycle maker now known as Schwinn. She rose through the ranks and became one of the highest-paid woman there, she said. Her manager asked about taking on more responsibility. But, she said, she \u201cgave them the impression that I\u2019m happy where I am.\u201d Growing up poor also made her feel like she wasn\u2019t meant for greater things, she said. \u201cI could have been a real career woman,\u201d said Skjordahl, who quit her job to raise her sons. \u201cBut I just preferred to stay in the background.\u201d\n\nNow in an independent living community in Tucson, she keeps up with the news, visits friends and paints. Skjordahl\u2019s advice to others: \u201cDon\u2019t be a slacker.\u201d\n\nKeep asking questions\n\nBetty Reid Soskin, 102\n\nLocation: Richmond, Calif.\n\nBetty Reid Soskin worked as a clerk for a segregated labor union during World War II. With her first husband, she opened a record store that served the Black community in the Bay Area. She\u2019s been a political activist since the 1960s and served as the oldest ranger in the National Park Service.\n\nBut she is reluctant to dispense specific advice, since she learned the most in life by just continuing to ask questions, she said, from her home in Richmond, Calif. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to learn. We have a whole lifetime in order to figure out what those things are, and I am still learning, even at 102.\u201d Life is about \u201casking the questions over and over again,\u201d Soskin said. \u201cAnd each time you ask them, they deepen.\u201d\n\nSoskin said she became a park ranger at age 85 because she wanted to tell people who visited the park where she worked, Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historic Park, her story as a Black woman who lived through racial segregation during wartime.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 20, life was ahead of me. When I was 30, I still had life ahead of me,\u201d Soskin said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m now 102, and life is still ahead of me.\u201d\n\nBe kind\n\nMatilda \u2018Mattie\u2019 Clune, 102\n\nLocation: Oneonta, N.Y.\n\nMatilda \u201cMattie\u201d Clune, 102, has raised eight children, spent decades teaching fifth-graders, volunteered in her community and helped care for 17 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren. Clune, who lives in Oneonta, N.Y., said no matter how hectic life gets, it\u2019s important to help people and show up for your loved ones. Her advice: \u201cLive your life in a kind way. If you can, help somebody without making a big to-do about it,\u201d she said. \u201cKindness always comes back to help you.\u201d\n\nWhen she was in her late 70s, Clune volunteered at the thrift store of a hospice. Then, when her husband was diagnosed with bone cancer, they needed the hospice\u2019s support. He died in 2001, but she continued to volunteer there for 15 years. \u201cIt was a very rewarding experience for me,\u201d she said.\n\nRecently, Clune said, a friend said she brings \u201csunshine\u201d wherever she goes. \u201cI guess that sunshine helps brighten my day, too,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNever stop reading\n\nPaul Dudley, 100\n\nLocation: Bixby, Okla.\n\nShortly after graduating from high school in 1941, Paul Dudley noticed a different car parked in the family driveway: a 1932 Ford Roadster. He asked his father whom it belonged to. \u201cIt could be yours,\u201d his father said. \u201cBut on one condition: You have to go to university.\u201d Dudley recalled, \u201cI said no. I had too much I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nNow 100 years old, Dudley, of Bixby, Okla., would tell his younger self not to pass on the chance to further his education. \u201cThe fact that I did not go to college is something I regret,\u201d said the World War II veteran and member of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma.\n\nAfter he served as an aviation mechanic and electrician in the war, his first wife, Dee, pressed him to go to college under the GI Bill of Rights. He felt he had other responsibilities. \u201cI had a family to support,\u201d said Dudley, who has two children. \u201cI had just joined the fire department and was working odd jobs to make ends meet.\u201d\n\nDudley, who worked at the Tulsa Fire Department for almost 40 years before retiring as deputy fire chief, eventually made it to junior college \u2014 as a teacher conducting classes in firefighting administration. He would tell young recruits not to ignore their education: \u201cSpend an hour every day reading. You cannot get enough education. There is always something you can learn.\u201d\n\nKeep moving\n\nTreasure Zimmerman, 103\n\nLocation: Coronado, Calif.\n\nTreasure Zimmerman, 103, calls herself \u201ca little\u201d independent. When she was in her early 20s, her mother didn\u2019t want her to marry the man she met in college because it meant she wouldn\u2019t stay in Kansas City. She married him anyway. \u201cGuess how many years it lasted? Only 53,\u201d Zimmerman said with a laugh from her home in Coronado, Calif. \u201cI had a good man.\u201d\n\nThat independence has empowered Zimmerman to jump into all sorts of adventures. For her 95th birthday, she drove by herself in her red Jaguar convertible from California to Kansas City. After World War II, when her husband started flying planes as a hobby, Zimmerman learned to fly, too. She ended up flying with a friend on a cross-country all-women\u2019s derby from Bakersfield, Calif., to Atlantic City. They finished 11th out of 60 planes in the Powder Puff Derby.\n\nStaying on the move has helped her live a long life, she said. A former physical education teacher, Zimmerman still walks every day with her dog Gigi, a 12-year-old Havanese. Her advice: \u201cEven when you\u2019re not feeling good, keep walking, keep moving,\u201d she said.\n\nStay determined\n\nWalter Alfred, 102\n\nLocation: Mumbai\n\nWalter Alfred\u2019s dreams were too big to be contained to the small town of his birth in southern India. He relocated to Mumbai at 17, initially living with a relative who helped him get an entry-level non-journalistic job at a news agency.\n\nHe taught himself shorthand typing and began to help reporters. His first reporting assignment followed. \u201cI had no mentor. It was sheer hard work and determination,\u201d he told his daughter, Anita Soans, in May.\n\nAlfred then became a foreign correspondent for Press Trust of India, the country\u2019s premier news agency, covering consequential world events including the assassination of Indian independence leader Mohandas K. Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi, and the Vietnam War.\n\nAlfred, of Mumbai, died Sept. 13, 2023, at the age of 102, a week before his birthday. Before he died, he offered this advice: Persevere through adverse circumstances. \u201cI lived this long due to focus and hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cAlways resilient, never fearful.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post is continuing to report on centenarians, and we want to know about their experiences.

A select group that is superior in terms of ability or qualities to the rest of a group or society.\u201d \u2014 Oxford Languages College admissions officers often made quite an impression on Doug Lemov\u2019s children when, as prospective matriculants, they visited campuses. Lemov writes that often the first thing admissions staff said was: \u201c[Fill in the name of elite college here] is not a school for people who want to spend their time in the library.\u201d One admissions representative urged prospective enrollees not to worry about the requirement to take a \u201cquantitative\u201d class. \u201cReally it\u2019s easy to get around. Almost anything can count as a quantitative class.\u201d\n\nThe evidence abounds: Supposedly elite institutions \u2014 like most of today\u2019s so-called elites \u2014 are nothing of the sort (see above). Lemov explains why.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLemov, an educator and writer about schooling, has published in Education Next a scalding essay (\u201cYour Neighborhood School Is a National Security Risk\u201d) about the crisis in the nation\u2019s most important supply chain. It supplies knowledge, understanding and shared principles, such as the merits of meritocracy.\n\nFollow this author George F. Will 's opinions Follow\n\nHigh schools, Lemov writes, are discouraging students like a young woman (now a biochemistry major in college) of his acquaintance. She took seven AP (advanced placement) courses, including calculus and college-level linear algebra. Her grade average was 96. But given rampant grade inflation, 93 was about average at her school, where the top of the bottom half of students reached \u2014 let\u2019s not say earned \u2014 90.\n\nHer school considered \u201ccompetition\u201d a source of \u201cstress\u201d (which occurs when something important is at stake), so the \u201chonor roll\u201d included more than half the students. The school embraced what Lemov calls \u201cinscrutable grading.\u201d A\u2019s and B\u2019s were replaced with jargon concerning about 30 skills (e.g., \u201cstudent can write sentences to create meaning\u201d), and students show \u201cmastery,\u201d \u201cpartial mastery\u201d or \u201cemerging mastery\u201d about this or that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMaking everyone equally successful,\u201d Lemov writes dryly, \u201cmakes a lot of people happy.\u201d Teachers get few complaints about grades from pupils or parents. The only losers are ambitious students who are deprived of the signals of merit, and the nation, which is deprived of excellence.\n\nAs high school transcripts become deliberately uninformative, and colleges abandon standardized tests for applicants, happy admissions offices have no inhibitions on their policies of \u201cequity\u201d and \u201csocial justice.\u201d Meaning discrimination for favored and against disfavored racial groups.\n\nUnexacting secondary schools seed college campuses with students spoiled by unearned flattery. They bring to college a complacent sense of entitlement. Writing in National Review, Frederick M. Hess of the American Enterprise Institute explains \u201cthe political consequences of campus sloth.\u201d Idleness breeds extremism and \u201cperformative rebellion\u201d among students who, \u201cbasting in a progressive hothouse,\u201d are \u201cincreasingly exempted from meaningful expectations of rigor.\u201d This is partly because campuses have burgeoning therapeutic bureaucracies that manufacture fragility by fretting about students\u2019 serenity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerformative bullying and wokeness flourish when, Hess says, \u201cstudents view admission to elite universities as the finish line instead of the starting gate.\u201d Hess says, \u201cWe\u2019ve normalized a college culture in which students believe that 20 or 25 hours of class and study time combined constitutes a full week.\u201d Besides, why study when grade inflation makes ersatz excellence so abundant? Harvard\u2019s average GPA was 3.0 in 1967, but 3.8 in 2022. At Yale last year, more than 80 percent of students in the proliferating \u201cstudies\u201d (e.g., women\u2019s studies; gender and sexuality studies; African American studies; ethnicity, race and migration studies) got semester grades of A. In math, engineering and economics (lots of \u201cquantitative\u201d courses), 55 percent or less got A\u2019s.\n\nLemov and Hess clarify why high schools and colleges are producing a national security crisis: The domestic supply of college graduates with advanced scientific skills \u2014 which are acquired in \u201cquantitative\u201d courses, not \u201cstudies\u201d \u2014 cannot begin to meet the nation\u2019s need for economic vitality and military preparedness. Lemov cites the Economist\u2019s estimate that by 2030 the U.S. high-tech sector will face a shortage of 1.4 million qualified workers, while each year only 70,000 students on U.S. campuses complete undergraduate engineering degrees. America depends on other nations\u2019 high schools and colleges for the foreign students who in 2016-2017 earned 54 percent of U.S. master\u2019s degrees and 44 percent of U.S. doctoral degrees in STEM fields."}

Oh, never mind. - The Washington Post", "domain": "washingtonpost.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMI7UlAowt9F0", "text": "When House Speaker Mike Johnson invited President Biden to give his State of the Union address on the unusually late date of March 7, people were puzzled. Now, the mystery can be revealed. House Republicans delayed the State of the Union so they could use the time to foment a state of disunion.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court last month sided with the Biden administration in a dispute with Texas over border barriers, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) asserted that the high court\u2019s order \u201cis unconscionable and Texas should ignore it.\u201d Never mind that two conservative justices joined in the order. Roy suggested that an appropriate response would be to \u201ctell the court to go to hell.\u201d\n\nReacting to the same ruling, Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) sounded a call to arms, posting on social media that \u201cthe feds are staging a civil war, and Texas should stand their ground.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), nearing the one-year anniversary of her secessionist call for \u201ca national divorce,\u201d announced: \u201cNow the Biden [administration] is at WAR with Texas.\u201d\n\nFollow this author Dana Milbank 's opinions Follow\n\nHouse Republicans continued the disunion theme this week, staging a news conference and a hearing to encourage Texas to fight the administration \u2014 and the Supreme Court. Rep. Brian Babin (R-Tex.), implying treason by the Biden administration, praised his state because it \u201cstood its ground against an invasion and an administration that clearly wants the opposing forces to win.\u201d And an earthy Rep. Randy Weber (R-Tex.) said of the Supreme Court: \u201cMaybe we ought to tell them to go butt a stump.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just words. These dime-store confederates are actively sabotaging the government they serve \u2014 by blocking it from mounting an effective response to the historic surge of migrants along the southern border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in October, Biden requested $13.6 billion in emergency funding for border protection, including the hiring of 1,300 additional Border Patrol agents and 1,600 asylum officers, as well as more funds to counter fentanyl smuggling. Because of Republicans\u2019 objections, Congress still hasn\u2019t approved a penny of it.\n\nAnd now, even as House Republicans wail about a \u201ccrisis\u201d and an \u201cinvasion\u201d at the border, they are mobilizing to kill a bipartisan deal emerging in the Senate to reform asylum claims and to beef up border security \u2014 regarded as the toughest immigration legislation in decades. Biden says he would \u201cshut down the border right now\u201d if given the authorities in the proposal.\n\nInstead of declaring victory and embracing the legislation they have long demanded, House Republicans are moving to impeach the administration\u2019s lead negotiator on the proposal \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas \u2014 on charges so flimsy they do not identify a crime of any kind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn lieu of allegations of high crimes or misdemeanors, the impeachment articles, approved early Wednesday by the House Homeland Security Committee, charge that Mayorkas \u201cterminated asylum cooperative agreements\u201d with Central American countries. There\u2019s just one problem with this: Secretary of State Antony Blinken is the one who terminated those.\n\nThe articles further charge that Mayorkas \u201cwillfully refused to comply with the detention mandate\u201d in the Immigration and Nationality Act. In fact, that standard has never been met in the decades it has existed \u2014 because Congress has never provided the funds.\n\nAnd the articles propose impeachment because Mayorkas \u201cterminated contracts\u201d for President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall. Congress\u2019s own investigative arm blessed the legality of the border wall \u201cpause,\u201d which, in any event, was Biden\u2019s policy, not Mayorkas\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnderlying the slipshod articles is this fundamental absurdity: House Republicans plan to impeach Mayorkas next week for \u201cfailure to enforce the law\u201d at the border \u2014 while at the same time loudly encouraging Texas to ignore the law at the border, as well as the highest court in the land.\n\nMuch has been said about the mental acuity of the octogenarian Biden and the soon-to-be octogenarian Trump. But the public figure who appears to be struggling the most with his memory lately is the 52-year-old speaker of the House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have a catastrophe at our southern border,\u201d he said after ascending to the speakership in October. \u201cInaction is unacceptable, and we must come together and address the broken border.\u201d He felt so strongly about this that he insisted last fall that border legislation must be enacted before he would allow emergency military aid to Ukraine to go through the House. \u201cI explained that supplemental Ukraine funding is dependent upon enactment of transformative change to our nation\u2019s border security laws,\u201d he wrote after a White House meeting. He told House Republicans in a private meeting that the demand for border legislation would be their \u201chill to die on.\u201d\n\nOther House Republicans had already said much the same. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the minority whip at the time, argued in 2019: \u201cThis is a broken system that needs to be fixed. It takes congressional action. You need to change the law.\u201d\n\nSome Senate Republicans, led by James Lankford (Okla.) did exactly that, negotiating a border-security compromise with Democrats and the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut then Trump intervened. Though he had long demanded that Congress \u201cchange our old, broken, ridiculous, weak immigration laws,\u201d the former president now panned the very idea, saying \u201ca border deal now would be another gift to the radical left Democrats.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, Johnson forgot everything he had previously said about border legislation. In an about-face, he decided Biden had \u201cample authority\u201d to enforce border security on his own, without the congressional action he had demanded until senators of both parties actually took him up on it. But Johnson didn\u2019t stop there. He went to the House floor on Wednesday and, in his first speech there since accepting the gavel, he ridiculed their \u201cso-called deal\u201d \u2014 sight unseen (\u201cI\u2019m working off of reports. I haven\u2019t seen the text\u201d) \u2014 as \u201cmadness\u201d and a \u201csurrender.\u201d\n\nThe speech was a splendid heap of contradiction. On one hand, the speaker sounded alarms about an \u201copen border\u201d and a \u201csoft invasion\u201d by \u201cmilitary-aged single men\u201d from \u201cterrorist regimes,\u201d \u201ccoming into our country to do only God knows what.\u201d On the other, he proposed to do absolutely nothing about it, saying Biden has \u201call the tools and the executive authority necessary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s as reckless as it is ludicrous. As my colleague Catherine Rampell artfully detailed, Biden has taken more executive actions than Trump did on immigration; many of Trump\u2019s border actions were struck down in court, including by Trump-appointed judges; and other policies \u2014 end catch-and-release! \u2014 can\u2019t be implemented because Congress hasn\u2019t provided the funds.\n\nConfusingly, Johnson still asserted during his floor speech that legislation with \u201ctransformational policy changes\u201d was still needed. But he was certain that the bipartisan Senate deal, which he hadn\u2019t seen, wasn\u2019t it. Yet even as he said that no immigration legislation was needed unless it was transformational, Johnson brought four decidedly non-transformational immigration bills to the floor this week that mostly rehashed existing law.\n\n\u201cI think I need to go to the Capitol physician and see if I can get a neck brace, because I have whiplash following the logic of some of my Republican friends,\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said during the floor debate. \u201cWe heard all year that we need to pass a bill in order to fix the immigration crisis at the border, and then ... we\u2019re told we don\u2019t need a bill, we don\u2019t need a law. Then here we are today dealing with four more bills.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is the new standard. The hysteria about a crisis along the border is matched only by a determination to do nothing about it. Rather than solve the problem, they prefer to have an issue for the 2024 campaign.\n\nAt a news conference on Monday, House Republicans invoked the \u201ccrisis\u201d on the border no fewer than 21 times and the \u201cinvasion\u201d at least eight times. A news conference by Republican leaders on Tuesday morning brought a dozen more mentions of a crisis \u2014 an \u201cunmitigated\u201d and \u201chistoric\u201d crisis, the \u201cmost pressing\u201d in history.\n\nA House Judiciary subcommittee hearing also on Tuesday morning on the \u201csouthern border crisis\u201d produced 19 more mentions of a crisis, and a whopping 113 mentions of an invasion.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Republicans brought their minor immigration bills to the floor. \u201cWe are here to address an ongoing crisis,\u201d said Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Tex.), leading the debate. \u201cThe word \u2018crisis\u2019 has been a hard one for my friends on the other side to absorb. \u2026 If this doesn\u2019t sound like a crisis to you, I don\u2019t know what would.\u201d\n\nResponded McGovern: \u201cHe thinks this is \u2018Beetlejuice\u2019; If they say \u2018crisis\u2019 three times, the crisis goes away.\u201d He told Republicans, \u201cShame on you for ginning up all this hate and all this vitriol and not wanting to be part of the solution.\u201d\n\nNow that Johnson\u2019s bluff has been called, we know that his GOP conference isn\u2019t in any hurry to find solutions to the fentanyl epidemic, MS-13 gangs, human trafficking or illegal border crossings. \u201cLet me tell you, I\u2019m not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating,\u201d Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Tex.) told CNN of the emerging border legislation.\n\nThis leaves two unsettling possibilities: Do House Republicans not really believe that there is a humanitarian and security crisis at the border? Or, worse, do they believe there\u2019s a crisis but would rather exploit it than solve it?\n\nHouse Republicans\u2019 usual legal allies have turned against them in their capricious attempt to impeach a Cabinet secretary for the first time in 148 years. Alan Dershowitz, Michael Chertoff and the Wall Street Journal editorial page have all criticized the Mayorkas impeachment, and even Jonathan Turley, House Republicans\u2019 all-purpose witness, has said there is no \u201ccognizable basis here for impeachment.\u201d\n\nIn fact, there is only one, non-cognizable basis for impeachment, and that is Marjorie Taylor Greene. She has been calling for Mayorkas\u2019s impeachment for 2\u00bd years, raising money off the effort, and she twice tried to force snap impeachment votes on the House floor last fall, until Republican leaders gave her a guarantee that they would schedule Mayorkas\u2019s impeachment.\n\nThis produced a pair of hearings by the Homeland Security Committee to fabricate a rationale for impeachment.\n\nAt the first, on Jan. 10, Rep. Morgan Luttrell (R-Tex.) asked law professor Frank Bowman whether selling fentanyl that kills a lot of people could be \u201cconsidered a high crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m unaware that the secretary has sold any fentanyl,\u201d the professor replied.\n\nThe congressman then asked whether Bowman would \u201cconsider slavery a high crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there any evidence that Secretary Mayorkas has enslaved anyone?\u201d the professor answered.\n\nThwarted, Luttrell abandoned his line of questioning. \u201cThis is getting a little bit more complicated than I thought it was going to be,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe take the use of impeachment extremely seriously,\u201d committee Chairman Mark Green (R-Tenn.), opening this week\u2019s markup of the impeachment articles against Mayorkas. Green has previously demonstrated his seriousness about Mayorkas\u2019s impeachment by telling political donors to \u201cget the popcorn.\u201d Green also previously invoked \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory, divining that Mayorkas\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d was to \u201cfundamentally change the population of the United States, and I believe to empower the Democrat Party in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nImpeachment ringleader Greene offered the panel a lesson on the Constitutional Convention. \u201cHistorical evidence is overwhelming that the Founding Fathers intended impeachment to be used to deal with the commission of indictable crimes and the abuse of power,\u201d she read. Except she pronounced it indickt-able. The real indictment is of Republicans, who are being led to impeachment by such a constitutional authority as Greene.\n\nThe session followed the usual pattern.

One measure of the quality of debate: Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) denounced Mayorkas for failing to provide testimony \u2014 \u201cthe committee has yet to receive a response\u201d \u2014 apparently unaware that, as the chairman had already noted, Mayorkas did provide testimony.\n\nRep. Rob Menendez (D-N.J.) tried to amend the impeachment articles to note that much of the supporting material had been provided by anti-immigrant organizations termed hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Republicans responded by shutting down the hearing and approving the error-plagued articles without further debate.\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re not debating it,\u201d Green said after cutting off amendments.\n\nThe ranking Democrat, Bennie Thompson (Miss.), called the Republicans \u201ccowards.\u201d\n\nBut the markup had gone on long enough \u2014 about 15 hours \u2014 to establish beyond a doubt that, despite their protests to the contrary, Republicans were impeaching Mayorkas because they disagreed with Biden\u2019s border policies.\n\nGreene, denouncing the administration\u2019s supposed \u201copen-border policies,\u201d said that impeachment was a way \u201cto push back on these policies.\u201d\n\nHiggins alleged that \u201cexecutive policy out of our White House, out of your president \u2026 is why our country is disintegrating, America. And who\u2019s ultimately responsible for that? The expert that President Biden hired. That\u2019s who we\u2019re impeaching today.\u201d\n\nRep. Carlos Gimenez (R-Fla.) said that \u201cPresident Biden and Secretary Mayorkas changed the policy\u201d at the border, and \u201cthe only remedy that we have is impeachment.\u201d\n\nThus have House Republicans set a new standard under which any future policy dispute between a president and Congress could be grounds for impeachment. And to what end? Even if Mayorkas is impeached by the House, there is zero possibility he would be removed by the Senate."}

So do my pals and I \u2014 especially when they include a sparkling ceviche in a paper-thin pastry shell served on a scalloped gold plate as fetching as the cubes of yellowtail, chiles and Meyer lemon. It\u2019s an amuse-bouche that does what it\u2019s supposed to do, whet the appetite for more.\n\nWe open the silver menu to find a nice surprise; since it opened in late September, Alias has added a five-course vegetarian option. Priced the same as the regular list at $145, including 22 percent for service, it\u2019s a splurge that welcomes a wider audience, like the six nonalcoholic drinks, including a sparkling \u201cCherry Lane\u201d made with sour Italian cherry, lime and soda. A seat at the counter costs a Jackson more and comes with frills such as a welcoming glass of champagne, foie gras and other luxe accents. The upgrade also places diners in front of the top chef, 27, who finishes dishes started in a vast kitchen behind a frosted window with the restaurant\u2019s name.\n\nBurke grew up in Warrenton, where his early interest in food led him to a job in the prepared food department at Wegman\u2019s when he was in high school, after which he moved to California to cook and met his future wife along the way. The couple subsequently relocated to Spain for three months and returned to Virginia in 2019, where both landed jobs at the esteemed Inn at Little Washington, and later, L\u2019Auberge Provencale in Boyce, Va., and Three Blacksmiths.\n\nThe first course is grilled salmon burnished with a Calabrian chile glaze and a pale green puree of watercress and apples for some, a petite tower of whipped sweet potatoes layered with wilted spinach and a glossy crown of greens for others. Out of the gate, it\u2019s clear that no matter which menu you\u2019re eating from, the kitchen treats everyone as equals. A second course of sliced roasted chicken showered with earthy shaved black truffles fits a fancy feast, as do housemade ravioli stuffed with carrots passed through a meat grinder twice with mustard seeds, fresh ginger and other warm spices.\n\nThe pasta, sunny with aji amarillo, tastes as vivid as it looks. Stephen Burke says he has worked with everyone on the team before, which shows in the smooth culinary performances. One sous chef spent three years in Peru and another hails from Mexico, backgrounds that also explain the menu\u2019s international flourishes.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer a surprise to get bread midway through dinner anymore, not in upscale restaurants at least. Alias still manages to delight customers with fluffy hot rolls that suggest a marriage between French brioche and Japanese milk bread offered with butter churned behind the scenes. (Gluten-free sourdough focaccia is the alternative.) As with the opening snack, the mode of delivery \u2014 a shallow dish that looks like a tree stump \u2014 is as engaging as the occupant. The bread is put to good use on Burke\u2019s sauces, including a spectacular sauce for rabbit coaxed from dried chiles, chocolate and kidneys for a pleasant mineral note.\n\nThe food is dropped off with a few words of explanation, not so long that the waiters sound as if they\u2019re reading from a script or worse, that you feel the need for them to pull up a chair to deliver the speech. I know a few D.C. restaurants that could take the hint.\n\nLook up from your plate and you\u2019ll see an industrial black ceiling, old rugs to warm up poured concrete floors and yellow walls hung with black-and-white photographs of Vint Hill when it was known as a military intelligence base. Listen and you might hear James Taylor, the Eagles or Roberta Flack singing. Save for a barn door, little evidence remains of the former occupant, Cafe at Farm Station.\n\nYou might not share my recollections from January. The menu changes every few weeks. Too bad you can only read about the plump marinated lamb rack, ringed in a jus of pomegranate and sorghum, or the grilled oyster mushrooms, lounging on buttery pureed potato and surrounded by almond cream. Come spring, the bulk of Alias\u2019s produce and herbs will be from the nearby Small Little Farm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe misses are few. The third-course rabbit is a little dry, but I admire its haunting sauce and its staging: a green necklace of parsley pistou adorned with vegetable bites. Bars of salt-roasted celery root on the meatless menu are upstaged by whipped red lentils seasoned with cumin, clove and turmeric. But most of the evening is so lovely, those things are almost forgotten when we start texting friends the next day about this exciting discovery.\n\nDessert brings a choice between a selection of American cheeses and an ultra-moist molasses cake alongside wine-poached pears and vanilla ice cream. Bonbons appear. Pressed coffee is served with a charming little sand clock. The owners sweat the small stuff.\n\nNot to take away from the work of pastry chef Brittany Davis, who previously cooked for salmon fishermen in Alaska, but the sweetest thing at Alias isn\u2019t on the menu. Atticus \u2014 the owners\u2019 6-month-old son \u2014 makes occasional appearances whenever the kitchen door opens, offering a glimpse of the toddler on a toy John Deere tractor, or when Dad brings him out near the end of dinner to show him off to admiring customers. (Fear not: The Burkes have babysitters and staff keeping watch in the background.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy posse leaves sated but not stuffed, with parting gifts of miniature flaky chocolate croissants (now chocolate mousse cakes) that are gleefully dispatched the next day. \u201cThe treats are great in the car, too,\u201d says Kelly, who knows diners all too well.\n\nJust like the restaurant that inspired it, Alias is a place we can\u2019t wait to experience again.\n\nAlias"}

Haley, who was U.N. ambassador under President Donald Trump, has finally stepped up criticism of her former boss and 2024 rival. She has attacked Trump\u2019s cozy relationship with authoritarians, his mental fitness and his spending record.\n\nBut perhaps her most striking line of attack was this: \u201cThis is a man who now wants to go and put 10 percent tariffs across the board, raising taxes on every single American,\u201d Haley said Monday on CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s going to raise the cost of anything from baby strollers to appliances under Donald Trump. Middle-class families can\u2019t afford that.\u201d\n\nHaley was referring to Trump\u2019s promise to jack up taxes by 10 percent on all imports into the United States, regardless of whether they\u2019re from friends or foes. Trump also reportedly plans to levy a 60 percent tariff on all Chinese goods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump and his allies, such as Stephen Miller, have claimed that these tariffs would be paid by icky foreigners and bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs. Recent evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nFollow this author Catherine Rampell 's opinions Follow\n\nWhen Trump was president, he levied tariffs on everything from steel to washing machines to hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of products from China. These trade wars were studied exhaustively by serious economists at Harvard, Princeton, the Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund, the University of Chicago, etc. Four separate studies determined that the costs of these tariffs were borne mostly or entirely by Americans in the form of higher prices.\n\nThere\u2019s also ample evidence that Trump\u2019s trade wars hurt U.S. jobs. That\u2019s because many of the things he tariffed were inputs that American manufacturers buy to produce their own goods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made steel and aluminum. But there are many more workers employed by U.S. firms that purchase these materials (automakers, appliance manufacturers) than those that produce it. The result was an estimated 75,000 fewer jobs in manufacturing attributable to metal tariffs alone.\n\nThe numbers look worse if you consider other countries\u2019 retaliatory tariffs.\n\nU.S.-produced soybeans, bourbon, motorcycles and other important exports were all hit with such foreign taxes, which hurt U.S. competitiveness abroad. A separate working paper released this week found that those retaliatory tariffs cost jobs, particularly in U.S. farming. This was despite Trump\u2019s costly attempts to bail out farmers hurt by his trade wars.\n\nIn a second term, Trump\u2019s plans to escalate these economic standoffs would likely cause much more pain. Exactly how much Trump\u2019s additional tariffs would hurt the economy is hard to know because it depends on how harshly other countries retaliate. Early comments from European leaders, though, suggest blowback could be fierce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCapital Economics, a private economic analysis firm, estimated that Trump\u2019s policies would subtract up to 1.5 percent from U.S. gross domestic product and \u201ctrigger a rebound in inflation that could force the Fed to raise interest rates again.\u201d Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, ballparks that the 10 percent global tariff alone would increase overall prices alone by two to three percentage points. That\u2019s about double today\u2019s pace of inflation.\n\nIf inflation is your top election issue \u2014 or your party\u2019s \u2014 this seems worth paying attention to.\n\nYet somehow, most Republican politicians (except Haley) have been curiously mum. A few grumbled when Trump began his tariff spree in 2018, but they were soon cowed. The import duties remained relatively popular among the GOP base, partly because the fallout of trade barriers is not always intuitive and also because Trump\u2019s co-partisans were too spineless to point it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRegarding tariffs, Governor Haley is doing what politicians, including Republicans, do not do clearly enough or often enough \u2014 especially when President Trump is proposing the tariffs: state that they are a tax on consumers,\u201d says Michael Strain, the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s director of economic policy studies.\n\nTrump\u2019s daft trade agenda could be a slam-dunk issue for Democrats. They\u2019ve bungled it.\n\nDemocrats (accurately) blasted Trump\u2019s trade wars when he was in office. In 2019, for example, then-candidate Joe Biden said, \u201cPresident Trump may think he\u2019s being tough on China. All that he\u2019s delivered as a consequence of that is American farmers, manufacturers and consumers losing and paying more.\u201d\n\nBut as president, Biden has mostly kept his predecessor\u2019s tariffs in place or swapped them out for different trade restrictions. This despite Biden\u2019s stated commitment to increasing competition (which tariffs reduce) and lowering prices (which tariffs increase). In fact, his U.S. trade representative, Katherine Tai, said this week that trade strategy should care less about \u201clower prices.\u201d"}

In the third part of the series, the aging Michael Corleone has been trying to distance himself from his old mafia businesses and ties. But inevitably crises flare up that demand his attention. \u201cJust when I thought I was out, they pull me back in,\u201d he cries.\n\nPresident Biden might be thinking just that as he wonders how to respond to the recent attack on U.S. forces that claimed the lives of three American soldiers in Jordan.\n\nEver since George W. Bush\u2019s second term, American administrations have been seeking to reduce their exposure to the Middle East. The argument makes logical sense. The United States imports only a tiny amount of oil from the region. Its efforts at regime change and reform in Iraq backfired spectacularly. The most important challenges to the U.S.-led international order come from Russia in Europe and China in Asia. The Middle East is a side show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut crises come not at times and places of your choosing. And the withdrawal of American power has itself set in play a series of moves that are now shaping the region. As Washington has lost interest in the Middle East, anti-American militias have been gaining strength and influence \u2014 from the Houthis to Hezbollah to the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (the umbrella group believed to be responsible for the attack that killed the American troops).\n\nFollow this author Fareed Zakaria 's opinions Follow\n\nIran is allied to all these groups, which helps it preserve its influence and weight in the region. Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has provided an ideal opportunity for these forces, because they can claim to be protesting Israel\u2019s actions \u2014 and in thus asserting themselves, demonstrating their might and gaining legitimacy.\n\nIronically, the Biden administration, which has been working hard to prevent these militia attacks from turning into something bigger, now needs to decide whether to itself escalate and respond massively. Biden is under pressure at home from Republicans who will accuse him of looking weak. Senators such as Lindsey Graham (S.C.) are urging him to strike Iran to preserve America\u2019s credibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA large U.S. escalation would be a mistake. These militias thrive on conflict with established armies. The Houthis endured nearly a decade of massive Saudi bombardment and came out largely unscathed. As Henry Kissinger noted in a Foreign Affairs essay on Vietnam mere weeks before becoming Richard M. Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, there is a simple rule: \u201cThe guerrilla wins if he does not lose. The conventional army loses if it does not win.\u201d The tragedy of U.S. foreign policy is that having seen the dilemma so clearly, once Kissinger entered government, he got seduced by the need to preserve American credibility and perennial pressure not to look weak. He supported massive military action against the North Vietnamese forces, which ultimately failed. The North won in Vietnam by not losing and the United States lost by not winning.\n\nIran\u2019s proxies are trying to stir up as much chaos as possible to force the United States and Israel into large-scale strategic blunders, which would among other things spoil a possible normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The attacks by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq on U.S. forces have a specific goal \u2014 pressure the government of Iraq to expel U.S. forces stationed in that country. The group\u2019s militias are the very ones that support the current Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad. In a battle between Washington and these militias, the Baghdad government would have to side with these groups that sustain it in power. This would complete the takeover of Iraq by Iran, symbolized by the expulsion of U.S. troops. And it would further the larger Iranian goal of unraveling the U.S.-built security system in the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe Biden administration will have to respond to the attacks on U.S. troops, but it should search for a way to do so that does not involve a major escalation. The Iranians have signaled in several different ways that they are not looking to escalate either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most effective response to this broader Iran-backed push against U.S. interests in the region would be to show not that Washington can escalate militarily \u2014 which of course it can \u2014 but that it can de-escalate politically. That means using the crisis in Gaza to create conditions for longer-term stability by addressing Israel\u2019s need for security and Palestinian aspirations for a state. Success on this front would then make it much easier for not just Saudi but also broader Arab-Israeli reconciliation. That kind of political and diplomatic response would not appease the war hawks in Washington, but it would be the most effective counter to America\u2019s foes."}

But prices painfully remain high for one particularly frequent purchase: groceries. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend. ArrowRight Grocery prices have jumped by 25 percent over the past four years, outpacing overall inflation of 19 percent during the same period. And while prices of appliances, smartphones and a smattering of other goods have declined, groceries got slightly more expensive last year, with particularly sharp jumps for beef, sugar and juice, among other items.\n\nStubbornly high grocery prices represent a critical drain on the finances of tens of millions of people and remain, along with housing, perhaps the most persistent economic challenge for the Biden administration as it tries to convince Americans the economy is back on solid footing. For all the attention on gas prices and housing, more than two-thirds of voters say inflation has hit them hardest through higher food prices, according to a November 2023 survey by Yahoo Finance/Ipsos. That\u2019s more than 50 percentage points higher than any other category.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there is no immediate fix for policymakers. Grocery prices remain elevated due to a mixture of labor shortages tied to the pandemic, ongoing supply chain disruptions, droughts, avian flu and other factors far beyond the administration\u2019s control. Robust consumer demand has also fueled a shift to more expensive groceries, and consolidation in the industry gives large chains the ability to keep prices high, economic policy experts say.\n\n\u201cI think people are waiting for prices to return to what they call \u2018normal\u2019 \u2014 and with the exception of a few things, like eggs \u2014 we\u2019re not going to see that. We\u2019re going to see prices stabilize, and that\u2019s likely it,\u201d said Dawn Thilmany, an agricultural economist and professor at Colorado State University.\n\nThe Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning think tank, reported Friday that almost 30 percent of the rise in grocery prices has been driven by just five categories of food particularly vulnerable to supply chain shocks, including beef, chicken, fruits and vegetables and snacks.\n\nNot all the news is bad. The rate of growth for grocery prices substantially cooled last year, falling to 1.3 percent from 11.8 percent the year before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while grocery prices overall are up, some food items saw substantial declines. Egg prices, after soaring, fell by more than 20 percent last year. Lettuce prices fell 17 percent, and tomato prices fell by more than 7 percent, among similar other drops.\n\nThat momentum is expected to continue: The Agriculture Department expects grocery prices to drop 0.4 percent this year.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until last year \u2014 three years into the pandemic \u2014 that we made big strides on ending the labor shortages. So it\u2019s going to take some time,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, an economist who worked at the Federal Reserve. \u201cDisinflation is not going to happen in all parts of the economy equally at the same time.\u201d\n\nPointing to a decline in the costs being paid by producers, the Biden administration has said grocery stores can do more to alleviate the sticker shock facing shoppers. An administration spokesman also cited actions it has taken so far to ease fertilizer prices, improve the capacity of the meat and poultry industries, and advance an antitrust agenda to increase competition in the agriculture sector. The Groundwork Collaborative report urged the Biden administration to go further, including by finalizing new rules to reduce concentration in the meatpacking industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPresident Biden has made clear that as input prices fall, corporations should pass those savings on to consumers,\u201d White House spokesman Michael Kikukawa said in a statement. \u201cThe Administration is cracking down on exploitative and anti-competitive behavior in meat and poultry markets, supporting state law enforcement efforts to stop practices that raise food prices, and pursuing all available avenues to lower grocery prices for families.\u201d\n\nThe high grocery prices reflect a number of economic factors. The run-up in food costs began early in the pandemic, when supply-chain snarls and worker shortages collided with rampant demand for groceries. But more recent developments continue to keep prices high: Droughts and extreme heat have dampened production of fruits and vegetables. Dry spells in India and Thailand have curtailed sugar exports. And an ongoing avian flu outbreak, the largest in U.S. history, sent chicken and egg prices soaring, though egg prices fell after an initial spike.\n\nHigher wages at processing plants, warehouses and grocery stores have also added to costs. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 prompted a spike in commodity prices for wheat, corn and vegetable oils that are finally settling back down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, demand for food \u2014 particularly meat, nuts and fresh produce \u2014 has remained elevated, as Americans splurge on higher-quality specialty goods and organic items, according to Thilmany, of Colorado State University. Households are generally allocating more to groceries than they were before the pandemic, even after accounting for inflation, in part because their buying habits have changed, she said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cPeople started spending a ton on groceries during covid and for a large subset of Americans, that\u2019s stuck,\u201d Thilmany said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m still going to get that rib-eye or New York strip even if it costs more\u2019 \u2014 and that pushes prices further up.\u201d\n\nThe White House Council of Economic Advisers also found in a new report that grocery store profit margins remain higher than their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn Phoenix, Quentin Vaterlaus and his family are spending 70 percent more on groceries than they did before the pandemic. Their weekly supermarket hauls added up to more than $6,000 last year, up from about $3,500 in 2019, in part because they\u2019re eating better, with more fresh herbs, whole wheat pastas and Kalamata olives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, he says they\u2019re shopping around more, toggling between Fry\u2019s Food, Safeway and local farmers markets for the best deals.\n\n\u201cHigher prices have caused us to shop around a lot more or simply go without,\u201d said Vaterlaus, 37, a data analyst whose household income has risen 40 percent since 2019. \u201cWe look at the weekly deals and only get what is on sale or needed.\u201d\n\nGrocery prices tend to play an outsize role in peoples\u2019 perceptions of inflation. Unlike more infrequent expenses \u2014 car insurance, say, or property taxes \u2014 that might deliver a similar dose of sticker shock, the sheer frequency of grocery trips makes price increases harder to swallow, said Ross Steinman, a psychology professor at Widener University who studies consumer behavior. \u201cWhen you\u2019re buying a carton of eggs or a gallon of milk every week, it\u2019s staring you right in the face over and over,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLow-income families have been hit hardest by rising grocery prices, and they spend 31 percent of their income on food, compared with 8 percent for wealthier ones. Food insecurity is rising and food banks around the country report significant increases in demand in the past year, particularly after the expiration of extra pandemic food stamps last February. (Still, the Biden administration has also approved the largest-ever expansion in the food stamps program, resulting in an extra $36 per recipient per month at the time.)\n\nThe Rhode Island Community Food Bank in Providence now serves about 80,000 people a month, up 20 percent from a year ago, according to Andrew Schiff, the food bank\u2019s chief executive.\n\n\u201cThis is absolutely the effect of high food prices,\u201d he said. \u201cThe high cost of groceries, combined with much higher rents and utility bills, has been a big burden for low-income families. We do believe that if food goes down, that will be a very big help. That\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping for \u2014 that in the next year, food prices will decline.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJasmine Sanders works two jobs, at H&R Block and at a home health-care company, but still struggles to afford food for herself and her two young children in Helena, Mont.\n\nThe single mother receives about $200 a month in food stamps, enough to buy two weeks\u2019 worth of groceries, she said. Sanders and her son are lactose intolerant, requiring her to buy pricier items like oat milk and dairy-free yogurt. But she\u2019s cutting back where she can, buying more generic items and less fresh produce, and has started stopping by a local food pantry once a month.\n\nThe difficulty of putting food on the table is making Sanders, 23, rethink her political leanings. Until a few weeks ago, she wasn\u2019t planning to vote in this year\u2019s presidential election because both candidates seemed the same, \u201csitting at those fancy desks, making decisions for rich people.\u201d But lately, people at work have started talking politics and she\u2019s started to change her mind. Sanders feels her financial footing slipping away, and says she worries about the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt the moment, Trump is looking like the better guy,\u201d she said. \u201cLast time, I thought he had too many scandals. But now with inflation going on, with prices the way they are, it seems like he wants to make the economy better for people like us.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Donald Trump\u2019s policies are poised to make grocery prices higher, not lower. The former president is campaigning on placing new tariffs on trillions of dollars of imports and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, which would likely make costs significantly higher for domestic beef, chicken and dairy products. But for now at least, the politics of high grocery prices appears much more likely to be a problem for Biden."}

But the operative word in that sentence is \u201chistory.\u201d For the first time on record, most American students are whisked to school in a private vehicle. Skip to end of carousel Department of Data We here at the Department of Data are dedicated to exploring the weird and wondrous power of the data that defines our world. Read more. End of carousel In 2022, youths of almost every age shifted from bus to Buick, with 53 percent of U.S. students getting dropped off at school or driving themselves, according to our analysis of the recently revamped National Household Travel Survey. The survey, from the fine folks at the Federal Highway Administration, collects detailed transportation data, including trip logs, from about 17,000 Americans in about 8,000 households.\n\nAs carting kids around has become the defining act of modern parenthood, the K-12 experience has increasingly revolved around the school pickup line. (Don\u2019t bother Googling that. One actual example: \u201cWill you be my student loans? Because I\u2019d like to have you around for the rest of my life.\u201d)\n\nFor an expert evaluation of school pickup lines, we called University of Kansas economist Misty Heggeness. When she moved from school-bus-saturated suburban Maryland to the transit-challenged outskirts of Kansas City, Kan., Heggeness discovered her own \u201cdeeply personal hell\u201d \u2014 two hours a day spent waiting in, or driving to, an endless queue of SUVs and sedans in front of her children\u2019s middle and high schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a researcher who measures gender inequality and the burdens that mothers face, Heggeness understands the value of parents\u2019 time. She even calculated how much the district would owe her for daily kid deliveries, if it paid her a going rate \u2014 which, of course, it does not. It\u2019s a lot. Heggeness said she can\u2019t believe other parents aren\u2019t as ripsnorting riled up as she is.\n\n\u201cWhy is nobody fixing this?\u201d she asked us, rhetorically. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t parents speaking up?\u201d\n\nPerhaps answering her own question, she later explained that \u201cthe experiences of the pandemic made parents much more willing to put up with these types of shenanigans just to get the kids back in school.\u201d Then this \u201creally inefficient equilibrium \u2026 became the new routine.\u201d\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic accelerated a shift long in the making, said Dave Cowan, a genial walking-and-biking-to-school booster with the nonprofit Safe Routes Partnership. Fifty years ago, feet and pedals dominated the school transportation scene, but that depended on schools being built in the heart of dense neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved our schools to where land is less expensive and more expansive, but less accessible to those walking and bicycling,\u201d Cowan told us. \u201cWhen we build schools on the edge or out of town, we create a long-term transportation problem because now we commit to a lifetime of transporting students to that school.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA crisis like the pandemic amplifies the structural issues we\u2019ve built into our schools, Cowan said. Some bus drivers refused to work because of the health threat. Others cashed in on their commercial drivers\u2019 licenses to make far more money elsewhere in the booming transportation industry. In recent months, drivers have been some of the most in-demand workers in the entire country, according to data from Indeed that compares job openings with their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nTo papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 over the driver shortfall, schools are slashing bus service, changing hours, canceling days and even paying parents to drive their own offspring. Philadelphia, for example, pays parents $300 a month, or $3,000 a year per household. The program began in 2020 and now includes 16,000 students, not far below the 23,000 students who use yellow buses (but well below the 55,000 who rely on public-transit fare cards).\n\nA little deeper in the transportation survey, we found that not all parents were responding to bus cutbacks by driving their own children. Rising pickups were driven entirely by parents like Heggeness \u2014 those with college degrees. Before the pandemic, about 55 percent of kids with at least one parent who had a four-year college degree were driven (or drove) to school. By 2022, that was 62 percent. Their bus ridership fell by a corresponding amount.\n\nMeanwhile, students whose parents don\u2019t have a four-year degree have seen a slight rise in school bus use. Unlike their better-off friends, their use of private vehicles hasn\u2019t budged. They\u2019re even walking and biking to school less often.\n\nThe proliferating pickup lines seem to be driven more by necessity than choice. The ride to school isn\u2019t exactly quality time. Heggeness reminds us that \u201cfor most parents, getting their kids out of the house in the morning for school is not a pleasant experience.\u201d And experts like Daniel Mendoza, who researches atmospheric sciences and internal medicine at the University of Utah, say the long lines of idling internal combustion engines pose an obvious health risk.\n\nTo speak with Mendoza is to stumble into the eye of an emissions-research hurricane. With almost every sentence, he points to a new analysis underway, a new sensor or ventilation system he\u2019s testing, or a new social experiment he\u2019s conducting. Much of it focuses on how pollution affects students, schools and communities in unequal ways \u2014 a particularly urgent issue in Salt Lake, where winter inversions along the Wasatch Front trap dispiriting brown air in a \u201cpollution blister\u201d around the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven its hassles and hazards, why are more educated \u2014 and probably more affluent \u2014 parents more willing to brave the line? Matt Crespi, program director of the Civic Mapping Initiative at the National League of Cities, spends his life deep in the weeds of Americans\u2019 transportation decisions. So, we asked him.\n\nCrespi suggested that we consider a new factor: Could bus ridership be falling because more people are \u2014 like the economist Heggeness \u2014 moving to places with poor bus coverage? After all, college-educated Americans are substantially more mobile than their less-educated friends.\n\nIndeed, data supports this theory. Some of the fastest-growing states in the pandemic era are also the ones with the worst bus service, according to data from School Bus Fleet, a trade magazine with a self-explanatory title. Fewer than a third of public-school kids in Idaho, the state with the fastest-growing child population from 2019 to 2022, get to school by bus. If we split the country in two \u2014 the half with worse bus service and the half with better bus service in the 2018-2019 school year \u2014 we see that the child population in the worse half grew almost twice as rapidly.\n\nBut fewer than 1 in 10 Americans move their house in a given year. So Crespi pointed us toward a bigger factor: remote work. Flexible workplaces and schedules have obviously made it easier for Heggeness and her peers to slip away from work and cart around the kids.\n\nNot all parents have that privilege. Among those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, 39 percent worked remote or hybrid in December, compared with just 7 percent of people with a high school diploma or less, according to our friends at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBut if their parents can\u2019t interrupt their shift at the factory or the Fuddruckers to pick up kids, what are the children of less-fortunate parents doing? Given that researchers have found a strong link between lower socioeconomic status and high absenteeism, it seems likely that some of them have not gone to school at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApplied economist Michael Gottfried, now at the University of Pennsylvania, called this idea perfectly plausible. And he would know: His research into the causes and consequences of absenteeism in America\u2019s schools has been cited just about everywhere. It also has transformed him into an unabashed bus booster.\n\n\u201cI believe the bus is a lifeline for students,\u201d he told us.\n\nHe said districts looking to trim spending often see yellow buses as relatively easy to cut, because they don\u2019t directly involve teaching and protections for support staff are weaker. But that overlooks their effect on attendance.\n\n\u201cThe bus literally takes kids to school. Like, that is its function,\u201d Gottfried said. \u201cIf we\u2019re concerned about absenteeism \u2014 which we are \u2014 we\u2019re literally getting rid of something whose job is to take kids to school.\u201d\n\nTo measure the scope of America\u2019s attendance crisis, we called Liz Cohen, who read 127 books last year while raising three kids and collecting data on chronic absenteeism in public schools at FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University\u2019s McCourt School of Public Policy.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve always had populations of kids who attended school less regularly,\u201d she said, \u201cthere has really been a seismic shift since covid.\u201d\n\nCohen and her colleagues found that about 25 percent of public K-12 students in the typical state missed more than 10 percent of the most recently completed school year. That\u2019s almost double the rate for the school year ending in 2019, according to figures from about two thirds of U.S. states and D.C.\n\nCohen, Heggeness, Gottfried and others agreed that the long-run cost of students missing school obviously would be far higher than anything schools might be saving by cutting back on bus service.\n\n\u201cIt might seem obvious, but when you don\u2019t go to school, you\u2019re not going to learn as much, so you\u2019re going to perform less well on tests,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cYour grades are going to go down. You are less likely to succeed on all sorts of measures.\u201d\n\nGood day! The Department of Data runs on your quantitative curiosity. What are you wondering about: What are the most common thermostat settings? Are kids these days less likely to wear coats in cold weather? How do U.S. state economies compare with European states and provinces? Just ask!"}

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight The issue looms over both the case they will hear this month and the 2024 campaign. President Biden and other critics of the Republican presidential front-runner say that the attack was an insurrection under any definition and that Trump was the clear instigator. They note that more than 1,200 people have been charged with crimes related to the events of that day, with more than 850 of them convicted.\n\nTrump himself faces 91 charges across four cases, two of which are related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But insurrection is not among the charges, and he was acquitted by the Senate after the House impeached him on charges that included inciting an insurrection. Trump and his supporters say the lack of insurrection charges shows that the term does not apply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Supreme Court has the power to settle the matter, but it\u2019s not clear that it will. The justices are due to hear arguments Thursday, and though they are widely expected to resolve whether he is eligible, they could choose to decide the case on narrow grounds that sidestep the question of insurrection.\n\nThe case centers on a Civil War-era provision of the Constitution and raises issues that have lain dormant for more than a century. Interviews with legal scholars and historians reveal sharply divergent opinions that do not always follow ideological lines, reflecting why some believe it\u2019s so difficult to predict where the court\u2019s six conservatives and three liberals will land.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say where the court\u2019s going to go on this,\u201d said University of Notre Dame law professor Derek Muller. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many ways.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorado\u2019s top court concluded in December that the attack was an insurrection and that Trump is an insurrectionist who is barred by the Constitution from serving as president again. The Colorado justices ruled he could not appear on the state\u2019s primary ballot but put their decision on hold while Trump pursued an appeal.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to consider the Colorado challenge and will probably issue a ruling that addresses whether Trump can appear on ballots for all states. Maine\u2019s secretary of state has also ruled Trump ineligible, but a state court has said the Supreme Court needs to have its say before the secretary of state can make any decision.\n\nThe justices \u2014 three of whom were nominated by Trump, cementing a conservative majority \u2014 could rule in his favor without ever answering whether the attack was an insurrection or whether Trump is an insurrectionist. The court could avoid those questions by determining that Trump never took an oath that subjects him to the part of the Constitution barring insurrectionists from office; finding that the presidency is not covered by that provision; or ruling that Congress, rather than the judiciary, gets to decide who is barred from office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case nonetheless poses an issue that scholars have wrestled with in recent months \u2014 how Americans after the Civil War believed the country should deal with former government officials who participate in insurrections and try to return to office, and whether Trump\u2019s actions qualify.\n\nThree years after the end of the war, in 1868, the United States adopted the 14th Amendment and its Section 3, which bars from office those who took an oath to the Constitution if they \u201cshall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\u201d The provision was adopted to keep Confederates from returning to power but was written broadly enough to account for future insurrections.\n\nVoters and lawyers laid the groundwork for the legal challenge to Trump two years ago, when they filed a lawsuit that resulted in the removal of a county commissioner in New Mexico because of his role in the Jan. 6 attack. The theory gained currency in August with the publication of a draft of a law review article by two conservative law professors, William Baude of the University of Chicago and Michael Stokes Paulsen of the University of St. Thomas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGerard Magliocca, an Indiana University law professor who served as an expert witness for those challenging Trump\u2019s candidacy, said during testimony in the Colorado case that insurrection as it was understood in the 1860s was \u201cany public use of force or a threat of force by a group of people to hinder the execution of the law.\u201d\n\nOfficials at the time interpreted Section 3 expansively and, even before it was adopted, often considered remote links to insurrection to be disqualifying, he said. Congress in one case declined to seat a representative-elect from Kentucky because he had written a letter-to-the-editor early in the Civil War advocating violence against Union soldiers if they entered his state. It also barred a representative-elect from Maryland because he had given $100 to his son before he joined the Confederate army, Magliocca testified.\n\n\u201cDuring Reconstruction, \u2018engage in insurrection\u2019 was understood broadly to include any voluntary act in furtherance of an insurrection against the Constitution, including words of incitement,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s pugnacious speech to supporters on the Ellipse on Jan. 6 \u2014 as well as his tweets before and on that day \u2014 featured prominently during the hearing in Colorado. Trump urged his supporters to come to Washington for a \u201cwild\u201d gathering, lied about how the 2020 election was conducted, and told the crowd to march to the Capitol and \u201cfight\u201d for him as Congress debated finalizing Biden\u2019s victory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe fight like hell, and if you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore,\u201d he told the crowd in a speech that also mentioned the need to remain peaceful.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nTrump\u2019s backers attacked police officers and besieged the Capitol, delaying the certification of the election results for hours. Amid the assault, Trump lambasted Vice President Mike Pence, who was overseeing the joint session of Congress. Trump waited hours to tell members of the mob to go home, and told them he loved them as he directed them to disperse.\n\nTrump remained at the White House during the attack, watching it on television. The House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 assault recommended that he be charged with four crimes for his role in the day\u2019s events, including inciting or assisting an insurrection.\n\nBut Robert Delahunty, a Claremont Institute fellow who testified as an expert for Trump in the Colorado case, said someone would have to take up arms to be considered an insurrectionist \u2014 something Trump did not do.\n\nAnd, Delahunty noted, Section 3 is focused on those who commit insurrection against the Constitution. \u201cIt\u2019s not just any plain-vanilla insurrection,\u201d he testified, adding that there is no clear definition of insurrection against the Constitution. Congress, not the court, should be the one to set that definition, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 have been charged with assaulting officers, destroying government property, obstructing an official proceeding, engaging in seditious conspiracy and committing other crimes. Neither Trump nor anyone else has been charged with insurrection. Prosecutors have a range of charges they can file in serious cases and typically go with the ones that are easiest to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, said University of Maryland law professor Mark Graber.\n\n\u201cIt was never considered an element of Section 3 that you need a criminal conviction,\u201d he said, noting that after the Civil War many former Confederates were disqualified from office even though they had not been charged with insurrection or treason.\n\nThe Supreme Court case raises difficult questions, however, about who determines what qualifies as an insurrection and when someone is subject to Section 3. An expansive interpretation of Section 3 by the Supreme Court could lead to a spate of challenges against candidates for president and other offices. Recently, four voters in Illinois asked the state elections board to bump Biden from the ballot for his border policies, alleging he has violated Section 3 by giving aid to the country\u2019s enemies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSamuel Issacharoff, a law professor at New York University, said in an interview that he doesn\u2019t believe there is a clear definition for insurrection and is troubled by the idea that courts or election officials could prevent candidates from running.\n\n\u201cI think one has to be careful when we\u2019re starting to look at law professors using 19th-century dictionaries to ban somebody from the political process who got 75 million votes three years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nIssacharoff said he opposes Trump and believes he\u2019s a danger to democracy. But, he added, \u201cI think there\u2019s another danger to democracy, which is the exclusion of candidates who the people want to vote for.\u201d\n\nJill Lepore, a Harvard University history professor, said senators should have prevented Trump from running again when they considered his impeachment. Now, it\u2019s up to the courts.\n\n\u201cRepublicans in Congress have essentially forsaken their constitutional duty,\u201d she said by email. \u201cDo I wish they had not? Yes. But that doesn\u2019t change the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which disqualifies Trump. You may not like it. I may not like it. Who knows, the majority of the country may not like it. But that the majority of the country does not like it or even that it has not heard of it is not an argument against it.\u201d\n\nStanford Law professor Michael W. McConnell said in an interview that it is difficult to argue that Trump engaged in insurrection because he did not tell the crowd to attack anyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo say he engaged in the insurrection, even if it was an insurrection, seems like an enormous stretch,\u201d said McConnell, who teaches a course on the post-Civil War changes to the Constitution, including enforcement of Section 3. \u201cWhat did he do? We\u2019ve all watched his horrific appearance at the Ellipse. He wasn\u2019t telling them to attack Congress. He was telling them to march on the Capitol and to express their anger at what he wanted them to think was a stolen election.\u201d\n\nWhether the attack on the Capitol was an insurrection is a more complex question, said McConnell. \u201cInsurrection was a very serious thing \u2014 not a mere riot or rebellion,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be very careful about defining it down to include riots.\u201d\n\nScholars have also been debating whether the authors of the 14th Amendment meant for Section 3 to apply to the presidency, and for Congress to take further action before it could be enforced.\n\nKurt Lash, a University of Richmond law professor, said that \u201cthis cannot be adequately researched, vetted, debated and arrived at some type of scholarly consensus\u201d before the election, let alone before the Supreme Court has to rule on the case. He and his peers have spent recent months researching speeches, debates and other records from the years after the Civil War to understand what people at the time considered to be the sweep of Section 3.\n\nWithout a clear answer on whether the presidency is subject to Section 3, Lash said, Trump should be allowed on the ballot. The United States is governed by the idea \u201cthat we\u2019re ruled by the people, that our fundamental rules come from the considered deliberation and decision of the people themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you look for evidence that they engaged in considered deliberation, and here I don\u2019t think we have it.\u201d\n\nGraber, the University of Maryland law professor, disputed Lash\u2019s notion that democracy is better served by allowing Trump\u2019s name to appear on the ballot. In most European countries, \u201cthe only people who are eligible for democratic election are people who play by the democratic rules,\u201d Graber said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a democratic case for disqualification. There are democratic values on both sides.\u201d"}

On Thursday, the European Union approved a roughly $54 billion aid package after being delayed for weeks by opposition from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\n\u201cOur partners\u2019 stocks of missiles, air defense interceptors and ammunition for artillery is becoming exhausted, due to the intensity of hostilities in Ukraine, but also from a global shortage of propellant charges,\u201d Zaluzhny wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZaluzhny also criticized the \u201cweakness of the international sanctions regime\u201d of Ukraine\u2019s Western partners, which he said meant that \u201cRussia, in partnership with certain others, is still able to deploy its military-industrial complex in pursuit of a war of attrition against us.\u201d\n\nHe proposed that the key to Ukraine\u2019s victory was a sweeping futuristic upgrade of warfare capabilities including drones.\n\nUkraine\u2019s \u201cnumber one priority,\u201d he wrote, should be to create an \u201centire arsenal of (relatively) cheap, modern and highly effective, unmanned vehicles and other technological means,\u201d such as electronic and cyberwarfare.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for our armed forces cannot be underestimated,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is to create a completely new state system of technological rearmament.\u201d\n\nOne benefit of the high-tech strategy, he said, would be to provide real-time intelligence for Ukrainian forces, \u201cwear down\u201d the enemy and place \u201cfewer soldiers in harm\u2019s way, thus reducing the level of human losses.\u201d\n\nZaluzhny suggested that it would not take long for Ukraine to achieve this overhaul.\n\n\u201cTaking everything into account at this moment,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe think the creation of such a system could be achieved in five months.\u201d"}

The cache of information published by WikiLeaks, dubbed Vault 7, went online in several batches across 2017. It laid out many of the CIA\u2019s cyber capabilities and methods. The leak was the largest data breach in the history of the CIA and among the largest leaks of classified information in U.S. history, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York said Thursday in a statement announcing the sentencing.\n\nIt \u201cprofoundly damaged the CIA\u2019s ability to collect foreign intelligence against America\u2019s adversaries,\u201d put operatives in danger, damaged national security and cost the agency hundreds of millions of dollars, the prosecutors said.\n\nSchulte, 35, was convicted in 2022 of crimes including illegal gathering and transmission of national defense information. It was the second trial after a hung jury and mistrial on the most serious charges in 2020. He faced another trial relating to possessing thousands of child pornography images and videos, discovered on his computer during an FBI investigation into the leak, and was convicted on those charges in September. His sentence, handed down by U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman, is for all convictions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchulte was employed as a software developer from 2012 to 2016 in the Center for Cyber Intelligence, which conducts cyberespionage against terrorist organizations and foreign adversaries. Prosecutors said he was motivated to leak classified information because of resentment over the CIA\u2019s handling of his work-related grievances. He was angry about interpersonal conflicts, being transferred to a different branch, not being granted a certain level of access within the CIA\u2019s systems and similar issues, prosecutor Damian Williams said in court documents.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cHe chose to burn our nation\u2019s security to the ground because he did not get his way,\u201d Williams said, adding that Schulte had a comfortable upbringing and family support.\n\nSchulte maintains his innocence, his attorney C\u00e9sar de Castro said in sentencing submissions to the court. He had been subjected to \u201cunconscionably punitive conditions\u201d while in jail awaiting trial and sentencing, including being locked in his cell for 23 hours a day with no contact with other inmates, frequent missed meals, constant light and cold temperatures, de Castro said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are very disappointed that Mr. Schulte received 40 years imprisonment, however, relieved that he did not receive life imprisonment as strongly urged by the government,\u201d de Castro said Thursday in an email. He had asked for nine years imprisonment."}

At the request of her social media team in Cairo, she looked for words to convey what she was feeling \u2014 that nothing good would come from the Hamas attacks or the war in Gaza sure to follow.\n\n\u201cThe only victor is God\u201d seemed safe, she said. It reflected her beliefs as a pacifist and an adherent of Sufism, a mystical branch of Islam. Her team posted it in Arabic: \u201cLa gha-leb il-la lah.\u201d Without telling her, she said, they also added a Palestinian flag to the message, as they usually did to posts about her music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she viewed the post the next day and saw the flag, her heart sank. \u201cI feel sick to my stomach,\u201d she wrote in an immediate text to the team that she later showed to police. \u201cThis makes the sentence seem biased.\u201d\n\nThe death threats started soon after \u2014 on social media and in menacing phone calls and, finally, in furious protests on her doorstep. Fellow Israeli citizens threatened to rape her, to burn her house down and kill her two children, to get her husband fired from his job as deputy director of the local hospital. When the couple went to a police station to ask for protection, it was Abu Amneh who was cuffed and jailed for three days.\n\nPolice said the Facebook post, her only public comment on the horrific events, amounted to an illegal provocation. Abu Amneh took the post down after it went viral, but has not apologized. She stands by the message, she said, which she intended as an expression of her faith. Almost four months later, her life is still upside down as she finds herself dangling from the tightrope that Palestinian citizens of Israel say they have been forced to walk since Oct. 7.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder emergency laws giving police unprecedented arrest powers, hundreds have been incarcerated, fired, or suspended from colleges for social media posts, protest slogans and even cooking videos that are deemed subversive. Ambiguous statements have been enough to launch criminal prosecutions; harassment campaigns continue even when charges are dropped.\n\nAs the war in Gaza grinds on, the attacks on speech haven\u2019t abated, according to rights activists. A parliamentary committee on Monday voted to expel a Knesset member who signed a petition supporting South Africa\u2019s genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice.\n\n\u201cThe binary approach that you are either with us or against is becoming institutionalized in the public sphere and in Israel\u2019s approach to its Palestinian citizens,\u201d said Ari Remez of Adalah, a civil rights group based in Haifa that is staffed by both Jewish and Arab attorneys. The group is following more than 270 cases of arrests, interrogations and \u201cwarnings\u201d related to speech, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArab citizens of Israel make up more than 20 percent of the country\u2019s population. They have long struggled to reconcile their Palestinian identity and their Israeli citizenship, and say the clampdown is just another example of how they can never satisfy either camp. The fury of her Jewish critics, Abu Amneh said, has been accompanied by anger from some hard-line Arabs over her post\u2019s \u201cneutrality.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know the language of both sides; we are connected to both sides,\u201d said Abu Amneh, 40, who speaks fluent Arabic and Hebrew and grew up with Jews, Christians and Muslims in Nazareth. \u201cIt is easier to be black or white, but we are gray.\u201d\n\nAlthough her case was quickly thrown out by two judges months ago, Abu Amneh remains under siege at her family\u2019s elegant stone house overlooking the Jezreel Valley. Crowds of protesters gather outside most nights, blasting music through concert speakers and shouting obscenities through bullhorns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir water is cut off for hours several times a week. The city confiscated their household garbage bin and parked a leaky construction dumpster in front of their gate, inviting neighbors to drop their trash. The family\u2019s security cameras captured a city worker tossing a dead cat into the unemptied dumpster.\n\nOne crew mounted an enormous light-up Star of David on a pole outside Abu Amneh\u2019s front door. \u201cEntrance to Israel lovers only,\u201d reads a sign mounted on the fence across the street, amid a string of Israeli flags and pictures of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Last week, the city changed the name of her road to \u201cIDF Street,\u201d after the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nAfula\u2019s mayor, Avi Elkabetz, is leading the charge against Abu Amneh. With municipal elections scheduled for late this month, the controversial incumbent has made Abu Amneh a campaign issue, demanding that other candidates join the protests at her home. The city\u2019s website has posted information on scheduled demonstrations there and at her husband\u2019s hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElkabetz has been at the center of other pushes to \u201cpreserve the Jewish character\u201d of Afula in recent years, as more Palestinians have moved to the city. He has opposed the sale of property to Palestinian citizens of Israel and tried to restrict them from using a city park.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe mayor, through a spokesman, declined to be interviewed or to respond to questions.\n\n\u201cIt is our government,\u201d said Anan Abbasi, Abu Amneh\u2019s husband. \u201cWe pay taxes for services and protection, not to be attacked every day.\u201d\n\nBoth husband and wife grew up in mixed Palestinian-Jewish communities. Abu Amneh\u2019s father was a restaurant owner in Nazareth, where she was a star science student and budding singer. She nursed both passions during the years it took to complete a doctorate in neurobiology at Israel\u2019s oldest university, the Technion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as folk music and singing grew more central to her life, she said, her Palestinian identity bloomed. In 2021, she launched a full-time singing career and quickly found an audience. She had toured the world, released three albums and amassed more than a million followers on Facebook and Instagram by the time her team in Cairo asked for her to weigh in on Oct. 7.\n\n\u201cThe only victor is God.\u201d\n\nShe said she was stunned by the ferocity of the backlash. One person suggested she had borrowed the phrase from the 8th-century Islamic conquest of Spain. Others compared it to a jihadist battle cry. The threats started on about Oct. 11, after the criticisms caught fire on Israeli social media.\n\nOn Oct. 16, the couple went to the police station in Nazareth to ask for help. While there, a group of officers from Afula arrived, handcuffed Abu Amneh and took her to a holding cell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges mounted quickly, according to her lawyer and court documents: threatening public peace (the Facebook post), resisting arrest (demanding to know why she was being detained) and threatening an officer (telling him, \u201cGod will give you what you deserve,\u201d a phrase she said she frequently uses on her children).\n\nThe three days in dirty cells, often in restraints, were among the worst of her life, she said. But the courts denied a police request to hold her longer, throwing out all three charges and chastising police for keeping her in shackles.\n\nThe night after she returned home, the first car pulled up to the house, blasting one of her songs and yelling for her to \u201cgo to Gaza.\u201d The next night, there were three protesters, then a dozen. Now, up to 30 people gather around 7 o\u2019clock most nights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe police told her the gatherings were considered \u201cprayer services\u201d for the troops in Gaza. When they did send a car, the officers often joined the demonstrators, Abu Amneh said. So she and her children, 13 and 15, lower the blinds and retreat to a back room. Even with their headphones on, they can hear the shouts of \u201cwhore.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the district police office said it could not stop the protected gatherings and that it had received no complaints of threatening behavior. Amu Amneh\u2019s lawyer, Amir Bakr, said the state prosecutor for the region has not responded to repeated requests to declare the protests illegal harassment. The prosecutor, Amit Aisman, declined to comment.\n\nHer husband is often away when the protests start, working at one of his evening ophthalmology clinics. He has diplomas from medical school, the Technion and Harvard on his office wall; during the pandemic he appeared in a video with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to promote vaccinations.\n\nNone of that seems to matter to those calling for him to resign or be fired. A neighbor who once hugged him for saving her son\u2019s life now joins those shouting, \u201cGo sing for Hamas!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNothing is enough for the extremists,\u201d said Abbasi, who, at his boss\u2019s request has written two public statements denouncing Hamas.\n\nAbu Amneh said she deplores the killing of innocents on Oct. 7, which goes against everything she believes in as a Muslim and a Sufi. She recognizes the pain of her fellow Israelis, she said, and expects they would also condemn the killing of thousands of innocents in Gaza.\n\n\u201cPalestinians have pain as well,\u201d she said, looking out from her house on a recent night, waiting for the return of her tormentors.\n\n\u201cNothing I am going through can compare with those who have lost loved ones, in Israel or in Gaza. Yes, I don\u2019t feel secure in my home. But I\u2019m a proud Palestinian, and they cannot silence my voice.\u201d"}

At emergency meetings in Brussels, Orban relented from previous threats to spike an E.U. plan to deliver $54 billion in aid to Ukraine over the next four years. \u201cThe Hungarian leader had pushed hard for the possibility of a yearly veto over the money for Ukraine,\u201d explained my colleague Emily Rauhala. \u201cInstead, leaders agreed to reviews of how it is being spent \u2014 with no veto.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrban\u2019s climbdown came after he had used a Hungarian veto to block the Ukraine funding package in December. But weeks of negotiations and a tacit pressure campaign against Budapest appeared to have changed his tune. Right-wing Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, once seen as Orban\u2019s fellow traveler, and French president Emmanuel Macron embarked on delicate charm offensives, according to Politico Europe. Meanwhile, officials in Brussels leaked plans to punish Hungary\u2019s economy should Orban further impede support for Ukraine, and floated other punitive measures including invoking E.U. mechanisms to strip Budapest of its voting rights.\n\nOrban grumbled about E.U. \u201cblackmail\u201d but nevertheless meekly acquiesced on Thursday. European leaders made no apparent significant concessions to the Hungarian leader to bring him on side. The moment illustrated Orban\u2019s isolation: Even ideological allies, like Meloni and Slovak prime minister Robert Fico, who met with Ukrainian officials last week, have softened their positions on supporting Kyiv.\n\nFor all his histrionics, Orban needs Europe more than Europe needs him. With his ruling Fidesz party entrenched in power, the Hungarian prime minister has used his platform to inveigh against E.U. edicts and wave the flag of right-wing culture war on the continent. Orban\u2019s antics help polarize the conversation within his country, turning the opposition into would-be abettors of overweening foreign technocrats. All the while, Hungary, one of the more economically irrelevant nations within the bloc, draws vital funds from Brussels as an E.U. member state, though the tap has been partially turned off in recent years over E.U. anger at Orban\u2019s alleged violations of the bloc\u2019s rule-of-law provisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHungary receives E.U. transfers that in good years can exceed 4 percent of GDP,\u201d explained the Economist. \u201cA mechanism inserted into the club\u2019s budget in 2020 allows it to impose financial sanctions on governments that violate E.U. rule-of-law provisions. These have helped extract concessions from Orban\u2019s government, for example on establishing anti-corruption safeguards. The E.U. continues to withhold funds worth \u20ac21bn.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nFor some European officials, Orban\u2019s intransigence over Ukraine was the last straw. \u201cThere is no problem with so-called Ukraine fatigue,\u201d Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said as he entered the summit Thursday. \u201cWe have Orban fatigue right now in Brussels.\u201d Tusk, a center-right politician and former president of the European Commission, the E.U.\u2019s executive body, is a noted antagonist of the illiberal right both in Poland and elsewhere. \u201cThis is for Mister Orban to decide,\u201d he continued, \u201cIf Hungary is part of our community, or not.\u201d\n\nOthers sense an opportunity to further tighten the screws on Budapest. Orban \u201chas given up his veto, received nothing in return and is completely isolated among the heads of state and government,\u201d Daniel Freund, a German member of the European Parliament from the Greens, said in an email statement. \u201cMember states\u2019 resolute stance towards Hungary has paid off. The lesson from this summit is that Viktor Orban can only be persuaded with pressure and a firm hand. There can be no more financial gifts to Budapest. Now it is time to promote the use of all available instruments for the defense of the rule of law.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump on May 13, 2019, called it an \"honor\" to meet Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who faced backlash for weakening Hungarian institutions. (Video: The Washington Post, Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nStill, Orban has reasons not to be disheartened. Whatever the humiliation endured this week, the political winds may still be blowing in his direction. The specter of former president Donald Trump, a staunch Orban ally, returning to the White House hangs over Europe. A slate of recent national elections in Europe have yielded victories for the far right.

I'm shocked.", "domain": "washingtonpost.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMI7UlAowt9F0", "text": "Dear Amy: Over the last three years, my husband and I have enjoyed several camping and mountain biking trips with another couple. \u201cRuth,\u201d the woman of the couple, works with my husband. I thought we had a good time as a foursome. Very few other women will \u201crough it\u201d in the wilderness like we four do.\n\nA few weeks ago, Ruth approached my husband and explained that they\u2019d been avoiding more trips for the past year, as they didn\u2019t think I enjoyed the trips. I emailed them to offer reassurance that I do enjoy the trips \u2014 and our friendship \u2014 and asked them to join me for dinner to discuss this while I was home alone for a week (my husband was traveling). They shut me down for any in-person interactions, saying that I project my unhappiness onto them, that they walk on eggshells around me, that I caused multiple instances of tension, and because of my \u201cimpacts\u201d they would remain intentionally unavailable.\n\nAmy, I was completely shocked! I had no idea they felt this way. They put on a good mask \u2014 for years. These people I thought were close friends shoved me aside \u2014 by email. If they had been honest about the tension they felt, I might have been able to change my behavior, or at least understand what was bothering them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I am confused, grieving a friendship, and just \u2026 really hurt. They acted like \u201cnice people,\u201d so this came as a shock. I am now questioning whether many other \u201cfriends\u201d dislike spending time with me, and are walking on eggshells. I feel social anxiety building in me. What can I do to move on and feel better about myself?\n\n\u2014 Broken Eggshells\n\nBroken: The one person you\u2019ve left out of your narrative is your husband. He is in the best position to gauge your behavior, as well as others\u2019 reactions to you, on these trips. You might have a blunt communication style that other people interpret as anger or tension. Instead of accepting, adjusting to, or rolling with your bluntness, they try to avoid it (by \u201cwalking on eggshells\u201d).\n\nYour choice to contact the couple and attempt to confront this issue personally in order to clear the air is one sign of your approach to problems. While to me this seems honest, forthright and fearless \u2014 this other couple seem to see your approach as aggressive, negative, or even hostile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis current challenge presents opportunities for you to gain insight into your own behavior and its impact on others. I suggest that you adopt an attitude of open inquiry regarding your own behavior by surveying people who know you best and love you the most. Your husband and siblings (if you have them) should be able to offer you honest feedback about your interactions. After taking a clear-eyed look at your own behavior (and making changes, if need be) you then have the right to judge this other couple as being disingenuous.\n\nDear Amy: I\u2019m a woman working as a nurse in a busy hospital. I have a younger colleague who at this point has a weekend shift. Two or three times a month, he asks me to change shifts with him. Sometimes I say yes \u2014 but most of the time I say no. Last weekend, as usual, he asked me to switch shifts with him, but I told him that I had family obligations over the weekend and couldn\u2019t do that.\n\nHe got really upset with me and said he was going to go to our supervisor. He did, and our supervisor sided with me. He now refuses to speak to me. I feel bad about it and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m doing the right thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 Tired in the ER\n\nShare this article Share\n\nTired: Your supervisor stood up for your right (and duty) to work the shifts you\u2019ve been assigned. This person likely assigns shifts for specific reasons (aside from availability).\n\nYour co-worker was arrogant enough to take this issue to your supervisor. At this point you might be relieved that he won't speak to you \u2014 but if this avoidance interferes with your ability to provide good patient care, your supervisor should again be told.\n\nDear Amy: I enjoyed the question from \u201cTired,\u201d who wondered how to get guests to leave at the end of an evening. My grandfather had a saying that he would invoke when he got tired. He would say, \u201cLet\u2019s go to bed now so these nice people can go home.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Lisa\n\nLisa: Beautiful."}

The agency also said it has upgraded a 2023 investigation into Tesla steering problems to an engineering analysis, a step closer to a recall.\n\nDocuments posted Friday by the agency say the warning light recall will be done with an online software update. It covers the 2012 through 2023 Model S, the 2016 through 2023 Model X, the 2017 through 2023 Model 3, the 2019 through 2024 Model Y and the 2024 Cybertruck.\n\nThe agency says that the brake, park and antilock brake warning lights have a smaller font size than required by federal safety standards. That can make critical safety information hard to read, increasing the risk of a crash.\n\nTesla has already started releasing the software update, and owners will be notified by letter starting March 30.\n\nNHTSA says it found the problem in a routine safety compliance audit on Jan. 8.\n\nTesla has identified three warranty claims potentially related to the problem, but has no reports of crashes or injuries.\n\nShares of Tesla Inc., which have been in a downward trend since July and slumped after the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings report last week, fell another 2.7% in early trading Friday to levels not seen since May of last year.\n\nIn December, NHTSA pressured Tesla into recalling more than 2 million vehicles to update software and fix a defective system that\u2019s supposed to ensure drivers are paying attention when using Autopilot.\n\nDocuments said the update will increase warnings and alerts to drivers.\n\nThe recall came after a two-year investigation by NHTSA into a series of crashes that happened while the Autopilot partially automated driving system was in use. Some were deadly.\n\nThe agency says its investigation found Autopilot\u2019s method of making sure that drivers are paying attention can be inadequate and can lead to \u201cforeseeable misuse of the system.\u201d\n\nThe added controls and alerts will \u201cfurther encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous driving responsibility,\u201d the documents said.\n\nBut safety experts said that, while the recall is a good step, it still makes the driver responsible and doesn\u2019t fix the underlying problem that Autopilot isn\u2019t reacting to stopped vehicles. They say that Tesla\u2019s driver monitoring system that relies on detecting hands on the steering wheel doesn\u2019t stop drivers from checking out.\n\nTesla says on its website that its Autopilot and \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d systems cannot drive the vehicles, and that human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.\n\nIn February of last year, NHTSA also pressed Tesla to recall nearly 363,000 vehicles with its \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system because it can misbehave around intersections and doesn\u2019t always follow speed limits.\n\nThe recall was part of part of a larger investigation into Tesla\u2019s automated driving systems.\n\nIt raised questions about CEO Elon Musk\u2019s claims that he can prove to regulators that cars equipped with \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d are safer than humans, and that humans almost never have to touch the controls.\n\nMusk at one point had promised that a fleet of autonomous robotaxis would be in use in 2020. The latest action appears to push that development further into the future.\n\nIn addition, Tesla is recalling more than 1.6 million Model S, X, 3 and Y electric vehicles exported to China for problems with their automatic assisted steering and door latch controls.\n\nChina\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation announced the recall in early January. It said Tesla Motors in Beijing and Shanghai would use remote upgrades to fix the problems.\n\nThe recall is due to problems with the automatic steering assist function and applies to 1.6 million imported Tesla Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Ys.\n\nWhen the automatic steering function is engaged, drivers might misuse the combined driving function, increasing a risk of accidents, the notice said.\n\nThe recall to fix the door unlock logic control for imported Model S and Model X EVs affects 7,538 vehicles made between Oct. 26, 2022 and Nov. 16, 2023. It is needed to prevent door latches from coming open during a collision.\n\nTesla was the top seller of electric vehicles in the world last year, but China\u2019s BYD beat the company in the fourth quarter. BYD is the leader in the booming China market.\n\nThe steering investigation upgrade, also announced Friday in documents, covers more than 334,000 Tesla vehicles.\n\nThe probe was opened in July of last year after the agency received a dozen complaints about loss of steering control in 2023 Model Y and 3 vehicles. Now the agency says it has 115 complaints, and it received another 2,176 after requesting information from the company.\n\nAgency documents say drivers are reporting loss of steering control, often accompanied by messages showing that power assisted steering has been reduced or disabled. Some complained of an inability to turn the steering wheel, while others said it required more effort.\n\nA message was left Friday seeking comment from Tesla.\n\nIn one case a driver told NHTSA that they couldn\u2019t complete a right turn and ran into another vehicle.\n\nThe agency said there have been multiple allegations of Teslas blocking intersections or roadways. Over 50 vehicles had to be towed, according to the consumer complaints.\n\nMany of the complaints reported the problem happened between 5 mph and 35 mph. The highest reported speed that alleged an inability to turn was 75 mph, the documents said.\n\nThe agency said it is looking into possible steering rack failures."}

Nearby, workers are whipping up batter in large mixers, rolling out lengths of dough, braiding and shaping them into rings and popping them into ovens.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar scene at Adrian\u2019s Bakery in the city\u2019s Gentilly neighborhood, where Adrian Darby Sr. estimates king cakes make up 40% of his business. \u201cWithout Mardi Gras, you know, you have to make cutbacks, and you don\u2019t want to do that. You\u2019ve got full-time employees and you want to maintain that.\u201d\n\nFood historian Liz Williams says the roots of king cake culture date to Saturnalia celebrations of ancient Rome, when a cake was baked with a bean inside and whoever got the slice with the bean was deemed king for a day.\n\nOver the centuries the traditions developed and were adapted into European pre-Lenten festivals that evolved into the modern Mardi Gras traditions.\n\nThe evolution hasn\u2019t stopped, according to Williams. King cakes in New Orleans were once uniform and simple \u2014 a ring of braided lightly sweet brioche topped with purple, green and gold sugar. Instead of a bean, tiny baby dolls \u2014 made of china at first, now plastic \u2014 were baked inside.\n\n\u201cThere was not really one variation from one bakery to another,\u201d Williams said. But by the 1970s, changes were happening. Some bakers began using Danish-style pastry dough. Some began filling their king cakes with cream cheese or fruit preserves.\n\nThe treat\u2019s popularity grew from one Mardi Gras season to the next amid the usual frenzy of parades and colorful floats, costumed revelry and partying in the streets. Years ago, Williams said king cake was probably consumed a few times a year, perhaps during a king cake party during Carnival season.\n\nNow, said Williams, Mardi Gras season means almost daily king cake consumption for some. \u201cPeople will pick up a king cake and take it to work, and whoever gets the baby has to bring one the next day, so people are eating it all the time.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s not a year-round binge treat. Tradition holds that king cake is not to be eaten before Carnival season begins on Jan. 6 nor after Mardi Gras \u2014 Fat Tuesday \u2014 which falls this year on Feb. 13.\n\nKing cake\u2019s popularity was evident one recent morning at Manny Randazzo\u2019s bakery in New Orleans, where a line of more than 60 people stretched down the street. Customer Adrienne Leblanc loaded the back of an SUV with king cakes for friends and family in New Orleans and beyond.\n\n\u201cSome of these are going to go to Houston, some will go to Mississippi,\u201d said LeBlanc. \u201cAnd some will stay here in New Orleans.\u201d"}

Tom Cotton, R-Ark.\n\nTikTok, which is operated by the Chinese firm ByteDance, has over 150 million users in America. U.S. lawmakers have regarded TikTok with considerable suspicion over whether its data can be accessed by the Chinese government and whether the app can be used to expand China\u2019s influence. Chinese companies are required to set up Communist Party cells.\n\n\u201cYou said today, as you often say, that you live in Singapore. Of what nation are you a citizen?\u201d Cotton asked.\n\nChew affirmed that he is Singaporean \u2014 which does not allow its citizens to hold dual citizenship \u2014 but Cotton pressed on, asking if Chew was a citizen of any other nation, and if he had ever applied for Chinese citizenship. China also does not permit dual nationality, and rarely accepts applications for citizenship.\n\nWhen Chew responded no to both questions, Cotton asked if he had ever been a member of the Chinese Communist Party or have had any affiliation to it.\n\n\u201cNo Senator, again, I\u2019m Singaporean,\u201d Chew responded, visibly perplexed. The party requires members to be Chinese citizens.\n\nCotton\u2019s line of questioning was described as \u201cMcCarthy-esque\u201d by The Washington Post. Clips of the exchange posted on social media platforms drew tens of thousands of views.\n\nAn Instagram reel of the exchange uploaded by Singapore flagship newspaper The Straits Times drew nearly 2,000 comments, most criticizing or mocking Cotton for his line of questioning.\n\n\u201cSenator, do you know where Singapore is?\u201d one person asked. Another remarked that \u201cjust because he looks Chinese, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s Chinese.\u201d\n\nAbout 75% of Singapore\u2019s approximately 5.9 million population is ethnically Chinese, a result of Chinese immigrants moving to Singapore in the 1800s and early 1900s. Many young Singaporeans today do not identify with China as a cultural motherland.\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing was Chew\u2019s second time appearing before U.S. lawmakers. He first testified in front of lawmakers in March 2023. That grilling lasted six hours, with lawmakers asking questions about TikTok\u2019s data security and harmful content on the platform.\n\nJojo Choo, an assistant marketing manager in her 30s, said she was happy to see a Singaporean appearing in Congress at first.\n\n\u201cInitially I felt pride because the CEO of such a huge company is actually someone from Singapore,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I quickly realized how ignorant the senator\u2019s questions were.\u201d\n\nChoo said the Cotton\u2019s questions were tinged with racism and it was \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d to assume that someone who\u2019s ethnically Chinese would be affiliated with China.\n\nAnother Singaporean, Fian Fazlie, said he was \u201ccompletely baffled yet amused\u201d at the senator\u2019s questioning.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just being ignorant and he\u2019s still justifying (his words) in his latest Instagram post,\u201d Fazlie, who works in the public transport sector, said about Cotton.\n\nCotton posted a clip of himself giving an interview on Fox News to Instagram, stating in the caption that Chew had \u201ca lot of explaining to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, you can be affiliated with or associated with the Chinese Communist Party anywhere in the world,\u201d Cotton said on Fox News, adding that the Biden administration has many cases against U.S. citizens suspected of collaborating or working with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\u201cSingapore unfortunately is one of the places in the world that has the highest degree of infiltration and influence by the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d said Cotton.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Cotton\u2019s claims about Singapore were based on.\n\nThe 41-year-old Chew is a native of Singapore, where he lives with his wife Vivian Kao and their three children. Prior to joining TikTok, Chew worked for five years at Xiaomi, a Chinese smartphone company. Before that, he was a partner at the venture capital firm DST Global and earlier worked at Goldman Sachs."}

The Los Angeles Times laid off more than 100 journalists in recent weeks, Business Insider and Time magazine announced staff cuts, Sports Illustrated is struggling to survive, the Washington Post is completing buyouts to more than 200 staffers. The Post reported Thursday that The Wall Street Journal was laying off roughly 20 people in its Washington bureau; there was no immediate comment from a Journal representative. Pitchfork announced it was no longer a freestanding music site, after digital publications BuzzFeed News and Jezebel disappeared last year.\n\nAnd journalists at the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, New York Daily News and the Conde Nast magazine company have all conducted walkouts to protest how management was dealing with business problems.\n\nSeeing all the damage is what led to the Washington-based National Press Club to open its weekly Taco Night to laid-off colleagues and offer a one-month free membership to people who need a networking opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important when people have lost their jobs to know that they have some support behind them,\u201d said Didier Saugy, the club\u2019s executive director.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE\n\nThe news business has been in a free fall for the past two decades, starting when much of its advertising moved online to opportunistic tech companies. Advertising is still a huge part of the problem, although there are more complex reasons and circumstances unique to individual outlets that also play a part.\n\nThe situation is dire at larger, more national organizations and in smaller communities. A Northwestern University study released in November estimated the United States has lost one-third of its newspapers and two-thirds of its newspaper journalism jobs since 2005.\n\nThe nation loses 2.5 newspapers per week \u2014 a pace that is accelerating, the study found. Through the end of November, the employment firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas estimated 2,681 journalism jobs were lost in 2023, and that tally has increased by hundreds since.\n\nOne industry observer, Jeff Jarvis, wondered on his Buzzmachine website this week: \u201cIs it time to give up on old news?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inevitability to what is happening,\u201d Jarvis, author of \u201cThe Gutenberg Parenthesis: The Age of Print and its Lessons for the Age of the Internet,\u201d said in an interview. \u201cPublications have been trying to preserve their old ways and their old models, and it is time for them to realize that it\u2019s not working and now it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been some successes in news outlets shifting their business to paid digital subscriptions \u2014 most spectacularly at The New York Times \u2014 failures are much more numerous. Even The Washington Post, whose subscriptions boomed during the Trump administration, has seen a falloff, leading its management to acknowledge that it was too optimistic in expansion plans and needed to cut costs.\n\nOptimism created by billionaire owners at the Post, with Jeff Bezos, and Los Angeles Times, with Patrick Soon-Shiong, has faded as it became apparent they didn\u2019t have magic fixes. With COVID and the Hollywood strike constricting the advertising market, the Los Angeles Times estimated it was losing between $30 million and $40 million a year.\n\nPhilanthropy has offered a boost to some news organizations, including The Associated Press. The MacArthur Foundation and Knight Foundation last year pledged $500 million to seed solutions in the news industry, but such efforts can\u2019t match the scale of the problem, Jarvis said.\n\n\u201cThe industry,\u201d he said, \u201cleaps from false messiah to false messiah.\u201d\n\nTech companies are also backing away from news, said Aileen Gallagher, a Syracuse University journalism professor. Through its AI-powered search generative experience, Google is much less frequently directing users to individual news sites, she said.\n\nPublishers have also complained of losing significant business with Facebook much less frequently featuring news articles that bring people to news sites. Twitter, now X, was once like a second home to journalists, but that\u2019s become much less the case since Elon Musk\u2019s purchase of the site.\n\n\u201cWhat the news companies may have finally woken up to is that nothing good will come from accepting the scraps that social platforms and search platforms will give the news business,\u201d Gallagher said.\n\nThe 2020 election proved a boon for many news outlets, but there are questions about whether the public will have as much interest in following political news this year.\n\nTHE PATH FORWARD IS JUST AS BUMPY\n\nSome of the troubled outlets also have unique issues that contributed to their problems. Sports Illustrated sent layoff notices to employees after the company that publishes its content lost its license to do so. The Messenger\u2019s failure angered observers because its business plan \u2014 a centrist website that tried to appeal to many instead of a tightly-defined audience \u2014 was an uphill battle to start.\n\n\u201cIt was business malpractice and human cruelty at an epic scale,\u201d Jim VandeHei, co-founder of Axios and Politico, told the Puck newsletter. \u201cAnyone who knew anything about the economics of media knew it would die quickly, spectacularly and sadly.\u201d\n\nThat sadness is apparent in messages left on social media by laid-off journalists from The Messenger and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI was laid off from my political writing job back in August and haven\u2019t been able to find another one since,\u201d wrote Tara Dublin, author of \u201cThe Sound of Settling: A Rock and Roll Love Story,\u201d on X. \u201cI am terrified about the future of journalism and how anyone is going to be able to trust any news source.\u201d\n\nSteve Reilly, an investigative reporter at The Messenger who saw his job disappear this week, wrote: \u201cIf you\u2019ve been affected by recent journalism layoffs at the Messenger or elsewhere, please know that it is not your fault. It has nothing to do with you or your work.\u201d\n\nJarvis, who also teaches journalism, said he doesn\u2019t pretend to know the answers. He said there needs to be an attitude change from searching for a way to monetize content to seeing journalism as a service to the community.\n\n\u201cWe need journalists in society, and we will find a way to fill that need,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic in the long run. But in the short run, it\u2019s going to be ugly.\u201d\n\n___\n\nDavid Bauder covers media for The Associated Press. Follow him at http://twitter.com/dbauder"}

Bragg\u2019s office was in the preliminary stages of discussions, internally and with Weisselberg\u2019s legal team, the people said. They may not necessarily lead to a criminal charge. The people were not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity.\n\nNews of a potential perjury charge was first reported by The New York Times. Messages seeking comment were left for Weisselberg\u2019s lawyers. Bragg\u2019s office declined comment. New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 office, which brought the civil lawsuit, also declined comment.\n\nWeisselberg served 100 days in jail last year for dodging taxes on $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation from the Trump Organization and is still on probation.\n\nA new charge, with the threat of more jail time, would upend the 76-year-old\u2019s Florida retirement and could weigh on his fierce allegiance to his old boss, who continues to pay his $2 million severance and legal bills.\n\nThe inquiry into the truthfulness of Weisselberg\u2019s testimony in the civil lawsuit is separate from the criminal case that Bragg brought against Trump last year over allegations that he falsified company records to cover up hush money payments. That trial is scheduled to begin in late March.\n\nBoth Bragg and James are Democrats.\n\nTestifying in the civil case, Weisselberg downplayed his involvement in preparing Trump\u2019s financial statements, which state lawyers allege inflated the former president\u2019s wealth by up to $3.6 billion. Frequently, he failed to answer questions clearly, uttering variations of \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d more than 100 times, according to transcripts.\n\nBut Weisselberg was firm in his response on Oct. 10 when a state lawyer asked him about how Trump\u2019s penthouse at Trump Tower came to be overvalued based on figures listing it as three times its actual size, 10,996 square feet (1,022 square meters).\n\nWeisselberg testified that he didn\u2019t pay much mind to the apartment\u2019s size because its value amounted to a fraction of Trump\u2019s wealth.\n\n\u201cI never even thought about the apartment. It was de minimis, in my mind,\u201d Weisselberg said, using a Latin term that means, essentially, too small to care about. \u201cIt was not something that was that important to me when looking at a $6 billion, $5 billion net worth,\u201d Weisselberg added.\n\nWeisselberg said he learned of the Trump Tower penthouse size discrepancy only when a Forbes magazine reporter pointed it out to him in 2016. He testified that he initially disputed the magazine\u2019s findings but said he couldn\u2019t recall whether he directed anyone to look into the matter.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t recall if you did anything to confirm who was right?\u201d state lawyer Louis Solomon asked.\n\nWeisselberg said he did not.\n\nHe was still on the witness stand when Forbes, whose reporters had discussed the size disparity with Weisselberg and revealed it publicly in 2017, published an article on its website suggesting he had perjured himself.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s Longtime CFO Lied, Under Oath, About Trump Tower Penthouse,\u201d the article\u2019s headline said. It said old emails and notes showed that Weisselberg had had extensive discussions with the magazine, trying to convince its writers that the penthouse was worth far more than they thought.\n\nThe penthouse gambit was one of several tricks state lawyers say was used to exaggerate Trump\u2019s net worth. A judge declared in September that the financial statements were fraudulent, but he has yet to rule on other issues that were the subject of the 2\u00bd-month trial where Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg pleaded guilty in August 2022 to charges he failed to pay taxes on $1.7 million in corporate perks, including a Manhattan apartment, Mercedes-Benz cars for him and his wife, and his grandchildren\u2019s school tuition.\n\nHe left New York City\u2019s notorious Rikers Island in April, days after Trump was indicted in his New York hush money criminal case.\n\nUnder that plea deal, Weisselberg was required to testify as a prosecution witness when the Trump Organization was put on trial for helping executives evade taxes. He did so carefully, laying out the facts of his own involvement in evading taxes but taking care not to implicate Trump, telling jurors that his boss was unaware of the scheme.\n\nA Trump Organization lawyer, Susan Necheles, told the AP last year that \u201cWeisselberg\u2019s testimony at trial was extremely helpful to the defense and hurt the prosecution.\u201d\n\nDuring the grand jury investigation last year that led to Trump\u2019s indictment, Bragg\u2019s office raised the possibility of charging Weisselberg with more crimes stemming from his decades managing the Trump Organization\u2019s finances.\n\nProsecutors suggested that might bring new charges related to his involvement in securing surety bonds and property valuations for the Trump Organization, alleged conduct that is the subject of James\u2019 civil lawsuit."}

She is survived by eight chicks, the loving staff at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, and by Chris Crowe, a human zookeeper whom Walnut regarded as her mate for nearly 20 years.\n\n\u201cWalnut was a unique individual with a vivacious personality,\u201d Crowe said, in a statement released by the National Zoo. \u201cI\u2019ll always be grateful for her bond with me.\u201d\n\nThe tale of Walnut (and Chris) has inspired internet fame and the occasional love song. It dates back to the bird\u2019s 2004 arrival at the institute\u2019s campus in Front Royal, Virginia.\n\nThe chick of two wild cranes who had been brought to the U.S. illegally and were later rescued by the International Crane Foundation, Walnut was hand-raised by people and bonded with her human caretakers. That preference continued when she came to the institute; she showed no interest in breeding and even attacked male crane suitors.\n\nBut white-naped cranes are considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Today, less than 5,300 remain in their native habitats in Mongolia, Siberia, Korea, Japan and China due to habitat loss, pollution, nest predation and poaching. And as the offspring of two wild-caught cranes, Walnut\u2019s genes were not represented in U.S. zoos. So convincing Walnut to breed was regarded as a priority.\n\nIn stepped Crowe, who, according to a zoo statement, won her over by \u201cobserving and mimicking\u201d the institute\u2019s male white-naped cranes\u2019 actions during breeding season.\n\nVideos show Crowe offering Walnut food as well as grass and leaves for nest-building materials. When he flaps his arms in front of her, the tall majestic bird flaps excitedly in response and dances in a half-circle with her head bobbing. Once Crowe had gained her trust, he was able to artificially inseminate her using sperm from a male crane.\n\nThe unique arrangement proved wildly successful and Walnut has given birth to eight chicks. The fertilized eggs were given to other white-napped crane pairs who tended to them as their own. Of the eight white-napped cranes currently living at the institute, one is Walnut\u2019s chick and another is her grand-chick.\n\nThe relationship also seems to have been beneficial for Walnut\u2019s health; at 42, she nearly tripled the median life expectancy of 15 years for white-naped cranes in human care.\n\nWalnut was born in Wisconsin in the summer of 1981. She was named after a local Wisconsin restaurant\u2019s popular walnut pie dessert.\n\nStarting on the morning of Jan. 2, keepers noticed that Walnut wasn\u2019t eating or drinking. Not even offers of her favorite treats \u2014 frozen-thawed mice, peanuts and mealworms \u2014 couldn\u2019t spark her appetite. Veterinarians administered fluids and antibiotics and drew blood for analysis. But her health continued to decline and Walnut was eventually hospitalized. She passed away peacefully, surrounded by an animal care team; an autopsy revealed the cause of death to be renal failure.\n\n\u201cShe was always confident in expressing herself, an eager and excellent dancer, and stoic in the face of life\u2019s challenges,\u201d Crowe said. \u201cWalnut\u2019s extraordinary story has helped bring attention to her vulnerable species\u2019 plight. I hope that everyone who was touched by her story understands that her species\u2019 survival depends on our ability and desire to protect wetland habitats.\u201d"}

The man, 71-year-old Jean Casse, struck his head on the pavement. He was pronounced dead soon after.\n\nWithin days, police hauled in a pair of young Brooklyn residents, 19-year-old Eric Smokes and 16-year-old David Warren, charging them with killing Casse. While both maintained their innocence, they were convicted at trial of murder and sent to prison for decades.\n\nNearly 40 years later, a New York City judge and a Manhattan prosecutor have sided with the men, now in their 50s. On Wednesday, years after a judge first denied their motions, their convictions were overturned after prosecutors said they uncovered evidence that police pressured witnesses.\n\n\u201cEric Smokes and David Warren lost decades of their life to an unjust conviction,\u201d Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, said in a statement. \u201cI am inspired by the unyielding advocacy of Mr. Smokes and Mr. Warren and hope that today\u2019s decision can finally bring them a measure of comfort and justice.\u201d\n\nSmokes was released from prison on parole in 2011 after serving 24 years. Warren served 20 years before his release on parole in 2007.\n\nThe two men, who grew up together and described themselves as brothers, spent years trying to clear their name. No DNA evidence linked them to the crime. The four witnesses who testified at the trial were all teenagers \u2014 some of whom later said they were pressured by police and even threatened with arrest if they did not pin the killing on Smokes and Warren.\n\nBut when the two men brought a motion to vacate the convictions in 2017, the effort was opposed by Judge Stephen Antignani and the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, then led by Cyrus Vance.\n\nChristie Keenan, an assistant district attorney, questioned the credibility of the recanted witness statements. In a 2020 ruling, Antignani denied their motion, finding the men had \u201cfailed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it is highly probable that they are innocent.\u201d\n\nAnother investigation was opened in 2022 under Bragg \u2014 one that prosecutors said uncovered \u201csignificant new evidence,\u201d including transcripts showing the teenage witnesses were pressured by police and that at least one of them was likely not in the vicinity of the crime.\n\nWith the new evidence in place, Antignani agreed to vacate the convictions this week.\n\nJay Henning, an attorney for the two men, said his clients were thrilled to see their names cleared. But, he added, the finding was long overdue.\n\n\u201cThis was a case of tunnel vision riddled with police and prosecutorial misconduct,\u201d Henning said. \u201cThis should\u2019ve been done a while ago.\u201d"}

New York-based Peloton lost 54 cents per share in the period and hasn\u2019t posted a quarterly per-share profit in three years.\n\nPeloton is projecting fourth-quarter revenue between $700 and $725 million, below analyst forecasts of $750 million.

People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular,\" said a book about the former president's business strategy.\n\n\"Truthful hyperbole,\" the book said, is \"an innocent form of exaggeration \u2013 and a very effective form of promotion.\u201d\n\nThe author of those words was Donald Trump himself, promoting himself and his purported business success in his 1987 book \"The Art of the Deal.\" And as Trump faces the possibility of being on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in legal penalties, Americans may finally learn what part of Trump's perpetual verbal autobiography is real, and what is bravado.\n\nHow much money does Trump really have? Is he \"really rich,\" and not in need of anyone's else's money, as he has repeatedly bragged, or will he be unable to come up with the cash to pay two separate judgments after having been found guilty of defaming writer E. Jean Carroll \u2013 as well as a looming judgment in a civil fraud case, where the New York prosecutor is seeking a $370 million penalty?\n\nThe courts, having access to financial information not entirely available to wealth-estimators such as Forbes and Bloomberg, are going to find out. The results will either buttress Trump's claims of massive wealth or expose him as a poseur. And mounting judgments could force asset sales that leave the Trump empire weaker.\n\n\"He literally was a showman\" as a businessman, says Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson. \"That works until people peek behind the curtain. Until a court issues an order, you don't have to show them the money,\" Levenson adds \u2013 but that time is coming.\n\nSo far, Trump has paid $5.5 million to the court while the first Carroll defamation case is under appeal. She would get the money if he loses his appeal, and he would get at least some of it back if he prevails in the appeals process.\n\nThe second judgment, for $83 million, is a bigger hit to his pocketbook and presents him with other options. He could pay it to the court while that case is under appeal or he could post a bond. That, however, would mean paying interest and possibly a deposit and collateral.\n\nThe biggest potential judgment comes in the civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The court has already determined that Trump committed fraud by securing loans through false financial statements \u2013 including inflating the value of his properties.\n\nThe fraud case is more complicated, experts say, since there was no clear victim identified. Trump may have exaggerated his wealth and holdings, but since he ended up paying his loans, no one suffered financially because of it.\n\n\"Frankly the evidence of 'unjust enrichment' is pretty weak,\" says Syracuse University law professor Gregory Germain, an expert on taxation, commercial law, bankruptcy and corporate law. Still, analysts note, that doesn't mean Trump should get a pass, any more than someone caught driving 120 miles an hour on the highway should be excused just because no one got injured as a result.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, who will deliver the judgment on financial damages as well as the fate of Trump's businesses in New York, hasn't been sympathetic to the idea that Trump's fraud caused no harm.\n\n\n\nThe Best Cartoons on Donald Trump View All 280 Images\n\n\"A lie is still a lie,\" the judge said during the trial. And Trump's antics during the trial have not endeared him to Engoron, Germain says, predicting that \"the judge is going to do a number on him. He's going to try to justify everything he can.\"\n\nThe court can either demand that Trump pay up-front while the appeals process proceeds or allow Trump to put up a bond or some other sort of security, explains New York University Law School professor Anna Cominsky. That process will provide an insight into Trump's wealth and his liquidity, experts say.\n\nIf Trump ends up with close to a half billion dollars in judgments against him, does he have the cash on hand to just pay it, pending appeal? A \"no\" would send a clear signal of how much money the former president really has \u2013 and how much is in properties Trump has already been found to have overvalued.\n\nThe former president has already shown he is either unwilling or unable to write a personal check to cover his legal woes: According to Federal Election Commission reports released this week, two of Trump's campaign committees \u2013 the Save America leadership PAC and the Make America Great Again PAC \u2013 paid a combined $55.6 million on his legal bills in 2023.\n\nThe former president will surely rack up more legal fees this year, as he defends himself in four separate criminal cases.\n\nIf he can't pay the judgments in cash, he might have to sell some of his properties, and that levies a \"double whammy\" on Trump's financial situation, says William Thomas, assistant professor of business law at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, since those assets would be unloaded in a \"fire sale\" that does not benefit Trump.\n\nIn real estate, investments pay off over years, if not decades, says Thomas, whose research explores the foundation of corporate and white-collar crime.\n\n\"If you're forced to liquidate, it's going to cost you. And we could easily see a situation where Trump finds himself essentially forced to liquidate some of his assets in order to cover the combined judgments he's facing,\" he adds.\n\nIn cases of massive judgments under appeal, judges tend to let people put up a reasonable bond, Thomas says, since it would be unfair for someone to lose properties permanently to pay a penalty later overturned or reduced on appeal.\n\nBut that also means Trump would have to convince an entity to offer him a bond (essentially a loan) \u2013 and that might be harder, given that Trump is facing trial on 91 felony charges and the fact that he has already been found to have exaggerated his holdings, experts say.\n\nThe judge may also accept James' request to ban Trump permanently from doing business in New York \u2013 and ban his adult sons from operating businesses in New York for five years, further hamstringing Trump and his family's ability to pay what the court demands.\n\nA final solution for Trump would be to declare personal bankruptcy \u2013 a move that would erase the image Trump has spent many decades burnishing.\n\n\"He has always marketed himself as some genius businessman. A genius businessman should not have hundreds of millions of dollars in judgments against him,\" Levenson says."}

But with the delay, Engoron has pushed his ruling into the same week the high court considers Trump\u2019s ballot status and anticipation heightens for what was promised to be an expedited ruling on presidential immunity that could upend Trump\u2019s several criminal cases.\n\nWhile the reason for Engoron\u2019s delay is unknown, the stakes are high. New York Attorney General Letitia James is seeking a staggering $370 million penalty from Trump. The ruling will also determine whether Trump is barred from participating in New York\u2019s real estate industry or running any company in the state \u2013 a potentially blistering decision that could effectively eviscerate the business empire he built over decades, which ultimately propelled the real estate mogul to the world\u2019s most powerful political position.\n\nThe long-running civil fraud case has been a source of intense frustration for the likely Republican presidential nominee, who is certain to appeal Engoron\u2019s decision.\n\nNotably, the pending judgment comes in the wake of a jury ordering Trump to pay $83.3 million in damages for defaming writer E. Jean Caroll . Combined with the forthcoming damages assessed for fraud, the total could near half a billion dollars and call into question the ability of Trump to pay such sums \u2013 or worse for him, strain his finances 10 months ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump is already siphoning a portion of his political donations to pay legal fees associated with the 91 criminal charges filed against him in four indictments. In 2023 alone, The New York Times reported , Trump spent roughly $50 million in donor money on legal bills and investigation-related expenses.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Washington on Feb. 8 in a blockbuster case that could prevent Trump\u2019s name from appearing on ballots come November.\n\n\n\nThe Best Cartoons on Donald Trump View All 280 Images\n\nIn December, the Colorado Supreme Court found Trump ineligible to hold office under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. Specifically, they sided with a lawsuit brought on behalf of a group of Republicans and independents who argued that Section 3 of the amendment prohibits an \u201cofficer of the United States\u201d who took an oath to support the Constitution and then \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d from holding office again.\n\nAmicus briefs flooded the high court leading up to next\u2019s week\u2019s arguments, parsing every detail of the amendment, including, for example, whether the article in question is \u201cself-executing\u201d or needs an act of Congress to be enforced, or whether the attack on the Capitol amounts to an insurrection and whether Trump actively participated in it.\n\nThe decision \u2013 put before a 6-3 conservative majority of which Trump installed three justices himself \u2013 is set to have major implications for American democracy and is notably just one of at least three cases the justices are poised to hear that could impact the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBut in addition to the New York civil fraud judgment and the high court arguments on the \u201cinsurrection clause,\u201d Trump is also awaiting a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where a panel of three judges is poised to issue a decision about whether the former president and his defense team can claim presidential immunity as a defense against criminal charges that accuse him of inciting a violent insurrection at the Capitol and attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAt a hearing last month, where Trump\u2019s attorney and Justice Department prosecutors squared off over the issue, the panel of three judges seemed deeply skeptical over Trump\u2019s reliance on immunity.\n\nAmong other things, the judges took issue with the underlying assumption from Trump\u2019s lawyer that the Senate must convict a president first through impeachment in order for prosecutors to be able to file criminal charges against him. They pointed out that many Senate Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, voted against impeaching Trump based on the assumption any criminal activity would be handled by the criminal justice system. They also questioned the limits of presidential immunity \u2013 at one point asking Trump\u2019s lawyer whether the same logic would apply, for example, to a president who used the military to assassinate a political rival."}

Reuters could not independently verify the figures.\n\nThe convoy hopes to bring more attention to border security as the number of migrants caught illegally crossing into the U.S. has reached record highs under President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking reelection in November. Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, the party\u2019s leading presidential candidate, have called for more restrictive policies and sought to motivate their base voters with the issue.\n\nEagle Pass has become a flashpoint in a dispute between the White House and Texas\u2019 Republican Governor Greg Abbott over federal and state powers to deal with illegal immigration. Texas has deployed National Guard troops to the border and laid concertina wire and floating buoy barriers in the Rio Grande in an effort to deter migrant crossings, leading to legal and political disputes with the Biden administration.\n\nIn a separate high-profile event in Eagle Pass planned for Sunday, Abbott is due to appear with 14 Republican governors to defend the state\u2019s border enforcement actions.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request for comment regarding the convoy.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll in late January found rising concern about immigration among Americans, with Republicans ranking it as the top issue.\n\nTrump has made immigration a key focus of his reelection campaign and sparked controversy by repeatedly saying that immigrants in the U.S. illegally were \"poisoning the blood of our country,\" language that has drawn criticism as xenophobic and echoing of Nazi rhetoric.\n\nBOOSTED ONLINE\n\nDetails about the convoy have reverberated around right-wing media, amplified by high-profile figures including former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Infowars founder and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Participants and supporters have organized and promoted the convoy on social media and in chat groups, including a \u201cTake Our Border Back\u201d Telegram channel, which as of Thursday had more than 4,400 members.\n\nA video promoting the convoy begins with \u201cWarning: Invasion Alert,\u201d and organizers and advisers have framed the action in religious, sometimes apocalyptic terms, describing the convoy in an interview streamed on online video platform Rumble as \u201cGod\u2019s vision\u201d and the illegal border crossings as \u201cthe biggest spiritual battle the world has ever seen.\u201d\n\nColtrin said the event was intended to be peaceful and organizers expected a \u201chefty\u201d law enforcement presence at the rallies. \u201cShould migrants cross, that is no business of the convoy,\u201d he said, adding that while some participants might be armed, Texas is an \u201copen carry\u201d state.\n\nStephen Piggott, an expert on right-wing extremism at the social-justice nonprofit Western States Center, said he is concerned that the convoy and attention it has generated could spur more people into taking action against migrants or the groups that assist them, regardless of how many people show up at the rally.\n\nIn 2022 a similar \"People's Convoy\" of more than a thousand vehicles traveled from California to the outskirts of Washington, D.C., as part of a protest against COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nRepublican Representative Tony Gonzales, whose district includes Eagle Pass, told Reuters he understands many Americans are frustrated over border issues, but that he won\u2019t be joining Saturday\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cThose of us that live on the border, that work on the border, we're exhausted,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cEagle Pass, three years ago, no one even knew it existed.

Hezbollah fired thousands of unguided rockets into northern Israel communities.\n\nThe conflict killed some 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers.\n\nA United Nations resolution ending the war called for withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon and a demilitarized zone on Lebanon's side of the border.\n\nDespite the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers, Hezbollah continues to operate in the border area, while Lebanon says Israel regularly violates its airspace and continues to occupy pockets of Lebanese land.\n\nHOW PROBABLE IS WAR?\n\nAn Israel-Hezbollah war \u201cwould be a total disaster,\u201d U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last month, amid a flurry of shuttle diplomacy by the U.S. and Europe.\n\nIran-backed Hezbollah seemed caught off-guard by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, a regional ally. Since then, Hezbollah and Israel have exchanged daily cross-border strikes, escalating gradually. Israel also carried out targeted killings of Hezbollah and Hamas figures in Lebanon.\n\nMore than 200 people, mostly Hezbollah fighters but also more than 20 civilians, have been killed on Lebanon's side, and 18 on Israel's.\n\nTens of thousands have been displaced on both sides. There are no immediate prospects for their return.\n\nIsraeli political and military leaders have warned Hezbollah that war is increasingly probable unless the militants withdraw from the border.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah hasn't threatened to initiate war but warned of a fight \u201cwithout limits\u201d if Israel does. Hezbollah says it won't agree to a ceasefire on the Israel-Lebanon border before there's one in Gaza and has rebuffed a U.S. proposal to move its forces several kilometers (miles) back from the border, according to Lebanese officials.\n\nDespite the rhetoric, neither side appears to want war, said Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in south Lebanon. However, \u201ca miscalculation could potentially trigger a wider conflict that would be very difficult to control,\" he said.\n\nHOW PREPARED ARE THEY?\n\nBoth Hezbollah and the Israeli military have expanded capabilities since 2006 \u2014 yet both countries also are more fragile.\n\nIn Lebanon, four years of economic crisis have crippled public institutions, including its army and electrical grid, and eroded its health system. The country hosts more than 1 million Syrian refugees.\n\nLebanon adopted an emergency plan for a war scenario in late October. It projected the forcible displacement of 1 million Lebanese for 45 days.\n\nAbout 87,000 Lebanese are displaced from the border area. While the government is relying on international organizations to fund the response, many groups working in Lebanon can't maintain existing programs.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency has provided supplies to collective shelters and given emergency cash to some 400 families in south Lebanon, spokesperson Lisa Abou Khaled said. The agency doesn't have funds to support large numbers of displaced in the event of war, she said.\n\nAid group Doctors Without Borders said it has stockpiled some 10 tons of medical supplies and backup fuel for hospital generators in areas most likely to be affected by a widening conflict, in anticipation of a blockade.\n\nIsrael is feeling economic and social strain from the war in Gaza, which is expected to cost over $50 billion, or about 10 percent of national economic activity through the end of 2024, according to the Bank of Israel. Costs would rise sharply if there's war with Lebanon.\n\n\u201cNo one wants this war, or wishes it on anyone,\u201d said Tal Beeri of the Alma Research and Education Center, a think tank focusing on northern Israel security. But he said he believes an armed conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is inevitable, arguing that diplomatic solutions appear unlikely and would only allow Hezbollah's strategic threats to increase.\n\nIsrael has evacuated 60,000 residents from towns nearest the border, where there's no warning time for rocket launches because of the proximity of Hezbollah squads.\n\nIn a war, there would be no point in additional evacuations since the militia's rockets and missiles can reach all of Israel.\n\nAfter the Oct. 7 attack, the war in Gaza had broad domestic support, even if there's now a growing debate over its direction. Around half of Israelis would support war with Hezbollah as a last resort for restoring border security, according to recent polling by the think tank Israel Democracy Institute.\n\nIn Lebanon, some have criticized Hezbollah for exposing the country to another potentially devastating war. Others support the group\u2019s limited entry into the conflict and believe Hezbollah\u2019s arsenal will deter Israel from escalating.\n\nHOW WOULD WAR PLAY OUT?\n\nA full-scale war would likely spread to multiple fronts, escalating the involvement of Iranian proxies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen \u2014 and perhaps even draw in Iran itself.\n\nIt could also drag the U.S., Israel's closest ally, deeper into the conflict. The U.S. already has dispatched additional warships to the region.\n\nHezbollah has 150,000 to 200,000 rockets and missiles of various ranges, said Orna Mizrahi of the Israeli think tank Institute for National Security Studies. This arsenal is at least five times larger than that of Hamas and far more accurate, she said.\n\nThe militia's guided projectiles could reach water, electricity or communications facilities, and densely populated residential areas.\n\nIn Lebanon, airstrikes would likely wreak havoc on infrastructure and potentially kill thousands. Netanyahu has threatened to \u201cturn Beirut into Gaza,\u201d where Israel\u2019s air and ground incursion has caused widespread destruction and killed more than 26,000 people, according to Hamas-controlled Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nIsrael is far more protected, with several air defense systems, including the Iron Dome, which intercepts rockets with a roughly 90% success rate. But it can get overwhelmed if a mass barrage of rockets is fired.\n\nSome 40% of Israel's population live in newer homes with private safe rooms fortified with blast protection to withstand rocket attacks. Israel also has a network of bomb shelters, but a 2020 government report says about one-third of Israelis lack easy access to them.\n\nLebanon has no such network, and shelters would be of little use against massive \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs Israel has dropped in Gaza.\n\nHezbollah has limited air defenses, while those of the Lebanese army are outdated and insufficient because of budget shortfalls, said Dina Arakji, with the UK-based risk consultancy firm Control Risks.\n\nThe Lebanese army has remained on the sidelines over the past four months. In 2006, it entered fighting in a limited capacity, but it's unclear how it would react in the event of a new Israel-Hezbollah war.\n\n___\n\nLidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel."}

How are we going to talk about migration, how are we going to talk about fighting drugs or fentanyl?\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration has relied for some time on Mexico's willingness to accept the return of migrants from third countries as a way of quickly returning migrants and asylum seekers at the U.S. southwest border.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nIt would be a political problem for Biden if Mexico refuses to continue doing so, or loosens up on its already weak efforts to control the flow of deadly opioids made in Mexico and smuggled into the United States.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 who pointedly called former president Donald Trump \u201cmy friend\u201d later in the briefing \u2014 did not specify who he wanted to apologize, but suggested that the U.S. State Department should say something.\n\n\u201cDon't the state department, the justice department, have any information?\u201d he said, calling the media reports \u201cinterventionism\u201d in Mexico's domestic affairs.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has denied old allegations that drug traffickers may have given about $2 million to his first, failed bid for the presidency \u2014 he lost in 2012 and finally won in 2018 \u2014 and called the reports a U.S. attack on his government and his Morena party before Mexico\u2019s June 2 presidential election.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, the presidential candidate for L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s Morena party, holds a commanding lead in opinion polls for the June 2 election. But Mexico\u2019s continued high rates of violence \u2014 and Sheinbaum\u2019s pledge to continue L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policy of not confronting drug cartels \u2014 are one of the governing party\u2019s most vulnerable flanks.\n\nAccording to reports by ProPublica, Insight Crime and Germany\u2019s Deutsche Welle, in 2010 the DEA investigated claims by a cooperating drug trafficker and a former campaign adviser that leaders of the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva drug cartel gave the money to close confidants of L\u00f3pez Obrador in 2006.\n\nBut a wiretap of a conversation between the DEA informants and one of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s top aides didn\u2019t really confirm the donations, and U.S. officials later ordered the politically sensitive case closed.\n\nMike Vigil, former head of international operations for the DEA, feared that the latest dispute could damage U.S.-Mexico cooperation on fighting drug trafficking, in much the same way as the 2020 U.S. arrest of a former Mexican defense secretary, Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has long complained about the actions of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Mexico, and following the arrest of Cienfuegos, he imposed restrictions on U.S. agents in Mexico.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just terrible, it\u2019s going to mean more drugs heading to the United States and more violence in Mexico,\u201d Vigil said. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than when Cienfuegos was arrested.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a direct attack against him. Secondly, he views it as an impact on the presidential campaign or the presidential elections that are coming up,\u201d Vigil said. \u201cNow, if we thought the relations with Mexico were bad, they are going to go from worse to almost nonexistent.\u201d\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has long been angry at perceived American interference. He claimed that the U.S. arrest of Cienfuegos, the former defense secretary, was part of a DEA plot to weaken Mexico\u2019s armed forces and allow U.S. agents free reign in Mexico.\n\nCienfuegos was arrested at a Los Angeles airport in 2020, accused of participating in an international drug trafficking and money laundering network.\n\nMexico demanded Cienfuegos\u2019 release, reportedly threatening to expel U.S. agents unless he was returned. The United States dropped the charges and returned him. Mexico quickly absolved Cienfuegos of any wrongdoing and later held up visas for U.S. agents and restricted the work they could do in Mexico.\n\n____\n\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"}

The bill passed by a vote of 357-70.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., threw his support behind the bill on Wednesday morning. He spent part of the previous day meeting with GOP lawmakers who were concerned about particular features of the bill, namely the expanded child tax credit. Some were also unhappy that it failed to address the $10,000 cap on the total amount of property taxes or state or local taxes that consumers can deduct on their federal returns. Raising the cap is a top priority of lawmakers from the Republican members of the New York congressional delegation, whose victories in 2022 helped the GOP take the majority.\n\nJohnson committed to moving a bill that addresses the cap, but there is no bill text yet and legislation would have to move through the House Rules Committee, which leaves the timing very much in flux. Athina Lawson, a spokeswoman for Johnson, said the speaker and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., agreed to work with lawmakers to \u201cfind a path forward.\"\n\nJohnson called the tax cut bill on the House floor important, bipartisan legislation that would revive \u201cconservative pro-growth tax reform.\u201d He also said it would bring an early end to a \"wasteful COVID-era program\" that has been plagued with fraud. Moving up the deadline for claiming the employee retention tax credit is expected to largely offset the cost of the tax cuts in the legislation.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nJohnson also emphasized the importance of the bill moving through the House Ways and Means Committee before coming to the full House for a vote, saying it was a good example of how Congress is supposed to work.\n\nHouse Republicans were anxious to restore full, immediate deductions that businesses can take for the purchase of new equipment and machinery, and for domestic research and development expenses. They argue such investments grow the economy and incentivize American companies to keep their manufacturing facilities and operations in the United States. The bill also provides businesses more flexibility in determining how much borrowing can be deducted.\n\n\u201cEach of these policies will help American businesses grow, create jobs and sharpen their competitive advantage against China,\u201d Smith said as debate began on the House floor.\n\nDemocrats focused on boosting the child tax credit. The tax credit is $2,000 per child, but not all of that is refundable. The bill would incrementally raise the amount of the credit available as a refund, increasing it to $1,800 for 2023 tax returns, $1,900 for the following year and $2,000 for 2025 tax returns. The bill also adjusts the topline credit amount to temporarily grow at the rate of inflation.\n\nHouseholds benefitting as a result of the changes in the child tax credit would see an average tax cut of $680 in the first year, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\n\nDemocrats pushed to restore the more generous tax credit they passed in 2021 in President Joe Biden's first year in office with payments occurring on a monthly basis. The credit was $3,600 annually for children under age 6 and $3,000 for children ages 6 to 17. But most lawmakers were willing to take what gains they could get through the compromise bill.\n\n\u201cYou know I\u2019ve been told that a half a loaf is better than none,\u201d said Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even half a loaf, but I\u2019m going to vote for it because our families and businesses need help.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in front of us tonight is pretty simple,\u201d said Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass. \u201cSixteen million children will benefit from the improvement to the child tax credit. That\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\nBut for some Democrats, it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cThis bill provides billions of dollars in tax relief for the wealthy, pennies for the poor,\u201d said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. \u201cBig corporations are richer than ever. There is no even split.\u201d\n\nAnd for some Republicans, it was too much. The chief critics of the expanded child tax credit likened it to \u201cwelfare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a refundable tax credit? It\u2019s welfare by a different name. We\u2019re going to give cash payments, checks, to people who don\u2019t even pay taxes,\u201d said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\n\nRep. Drew Ferguson, R-Ga., chafed at that characterization, saying \u201cwe all believe on this side of the aisle that you should work in order to receive federal benefits. That is something that this bill does.\u201d\n\nWhile there were complaints about the tax bill from some of the most conservative and liberal members of the House, a significant majority from each party voted for it. Proponents are hoping the strong show of support will stir action in the Senate.\n\nThe bill keeps a threshold of a household having $2,500 in income to be eligible for refundable child tax credit payments.\n\nThe bill also would enhance a tax credit for the construction or rehabilitation of rental housing targeted to lower-income households, adding an estimated 200,000 housing units around the country. That was a key priority of lawmakers from states with acute housing shortages and soaring prices. And it would ensure victims of certain natural disasters and the East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment don't get hit with a big tax bill for payments they received as compensation for their losses."}

There they found Mohn's 68-year-old father Michael decapitated in a bathroom with a large amount of blood around him and a knife and machete in the bathtub, the prosecutor said.\n\nAfter the killing, Mohn posted a 14-minute video on YouTube titled \"Mohn's Militia - Call to Arms for American Patriots,\" police said in a probable-cause affidavit posted online. The video was viewed more than 5,000 times before it was taken down, CNN reported.\n\nDuring the video, Mohn showed viewers his father's head twice and identified him by his name, saying \"he is now in hell for eternity\" as he read from a script, police said in the document.\n\nHe also said his father, who worked for the federal government, was a traitor, railed against the Biden administration and described himself as a militia leader, NBC News reported.\n\nThe killing comes amid the most sustained spate of political violence in the United States since the 1970s, according to a Reuters investigation last year.\n\nThat reporting documented at least 232 politically motivated acts of violence since Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Those attacks included riots and brawls at political demonstrations plus politically motivated beatings and killings.\n\nAmong the 22 fatal incidents of political violence identified in the Reuters tally, at least 15 were attributed by police or prosecutors to assailants who expressed beliefs associated with the extreme right.\n\nPolice were alerted when Mohn's mother reported she had not seen her son and that her husband's car was gone.\n\nHours after police responded to the grisly scene, authorities took Mohn into custody at the Fort Indiantown Gap, a National Guard training center in Lebanon County, about 110 miles (177 km) from the home.\n\n(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; Additional reporting by Peter Eisler in Washington; Editing by Bill Berkrot)"}

That news should help the U.S. stock market, which has gained 1.6% as measured by the S&P 500 index on a year-to-date basis. And it's not just the S&P 500. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 38,000 for the first time on Jan. 25. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite saw its highest close (15,628.04) in two years on Jan. 29.\n\nOn the downside, consumers are still fretting over high prices at grocery stores, though costs are expected to tick downward in 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Overall, food prices rose 2.7% from December 2022 to December 2023. Household kitchen staples like eggs and lettuce have declined in price, but beef and sugar prices rose from 2022 to 2023.\n\n\n\nFactor in still-record-high home prices, labor volatility that's led to tens of thousands of layoffs so far in 2024 (U.S. technology companies have already laid off nearly 30,000 employees this year) and stagnant wages, and the American consumer isn't raising any champagne glasses to the U.S. economy in early 2024.\n\nWhat does that mean for the U.S. stock market, which seems to be on the upswing this year? So far, it means continued uncertainty leading into a volatile U.S. presidential election season and more household finance angst in 2024.\n\n\"Views are mixed on the outlook of the stock market in 2024,\" said Steve Crews, a Calgary, Alberta-based mortgage lending specialist and founder of Golden Road Reborn, a global stock market trading system. \"Some traders predict a flat or down market in the first half of 2024 due to high inflation, recession fears and rate hikes from the Fed. However, others foresee a bull market continuing, citing potential Fed rate cuts, earnings growth and historical trends around election years.\"\n\nWhat are the key facts that could move the markets into deeper waters in 2024? Here are six keystone issues that could impact the financial markets this year:\n\n1. High Stock Valuations\n\nWhile valuations are stretched versus long-term S&P 500 averages (currently selling at 19 times next year's earnings, compared to a 55-year average of 16), interest rate fluctuations should drive stocks in 2024 \u2013 if they head in a certain direction.\n\nExcessively high valuations could lead to a problem with stock performance for the rest of 2024.\n\n\"The S&P 500's current forward price-to-earnings ratio is around 20, compared to about 17 at this time last year,\" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, wrote in the company's Jan. 8 investment committee weekly report. \"Meanwhile, the 'equity risk premium' \u2013 i.e., the reward an investor can expect for owning stocks over risk-free Treasurys \u2013 is at an extreme low of about 1 percentage point.\"\n\nIf you stretch the current valuation outlook along to the end of 2024 and into 2025, you can get a more accurate predictor of returns. \"On that score, today's valuation levels point to subpar annual stock returns, with gains averaging 4% compared to the long-run average of 7% to 8%,\" Shalett said.\n\n2. Overdependence on Leading Stocks\n\nThe so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2013 Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA) \u2013 were undisputed victors in 2023.\n\nThe Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index returned 107% in 2023 compared to the S&P 500's 24%, primarily due to upbeat company fundamentals for the major technology companies for the year, as noted by David Polak, equity investment director at Capital Group, in recent commentary.\n\n\"These companies not only benefited from their early investments in artificial intelligence, they also helped drive the S&P 500 higher, since the index is weighted by market cap,\" said Kelly Milligan, managing partner at Quorum Private Wealth in Danville, California.\n\nThere's just one problem: Most of the overall stock market gains last year were derived from the Magnificent 7 stocks. Any deviation from that performance could lead to market underperformance in 2024.\n\n3. Wishful Thinking on Interest Rates\n\nI nvestors may be counting on the Federal Reserve to aggressively curb interest rates in 2024, but Morgan Stanley's Shalett believes that may be wishful thinking.\n\n\"The market continues to assume that the Fed will cut rates more quickly and steeply than it has publicly signaled,\" she said. \"Despite the Fed's signaled intent to cut rates three times this year, futures markets are pricing more than six. That assumes the central bank will enjoy an uninterrupted victory in taming inflation, whereas we believe inflation in labor-intensive services is still likely to persist.\"\n\n\n\n4. Consumer Exhaustion\n\nU.S. credit card users are digging a deep hole with plastic debt. Credit card delinquencies were up across the board in the third quarter of 2023, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Those delinquency figures encompass credit card debt that's 30, 60 and 90 days past due, the Philly Fed reported.\n\nAdditionally, consumer non-mortgage interest payments have risen by 50% on a year-to-year basis, cresting $1 trillion in Q3 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n\"The burgeoning 'living beyond means' character of the consumer can most easily be seen when looking at consumers' revolving credit ... and the associated increase in serious credit card delinquencies,\" Charles Schwab investment strategists Liz Ann Sonders and Kevin Gordon wrote in a recent research report. \"Those delinquencies are particularly acute among younger borrowers. For now, healthy wage growth has kept the ratio of credit card debt to compensation historically low; but further weakening of wage growth will cause the ratio to climb.\"\n\nDownbeat consumer sentiment could weigh heavily on stocks, given that consumer spending accounts for about 70% of GDP, Sonders and Gordon noted.\n\n5. Stubborn Inflation\n\nCurrently, the U.S. inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) stands at 3.4%, with the Fed noting that inflation should fall below 2.5% in 2024 \u2013 still above the Fed's 2% target rate. It's worth noting that the Fed's preferred measure of inflation is the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index.\n\nSome economic experts point to the ties between worker wages and inflation, which remains high in early 2024. As U.S. Bank notes, average hourly earnings growth remains above 4%, which is \"still higher\" than the Fed prefers.\n\n\"If we look at the Fed's definition of progress on inflation, (the Fed wants) to get it closer to their target of 2% per year,\" says Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. \"The question is how much further inflation must level out before the Fed is again willing to change course on interest rates.\"\n\n6. A Roiling 2024 Presidential Election\n\nWith the Republican Party set to nominate former President Donald Trump and the Democratic Party circling the wagons behind an unopposed President Joe Biden, the 2024 election season has landed.\n\nGiven that polling numbers are down for both candidates, that landing shows more \"thud\" than \"bounce\" \u2013 and that's a big issue, given history shows that major election years have a significant impact on the financial markets.\n\n\"Going back to 1980, stocks have rallied in the year following an election, on average,\" says Greg Sweeney, chief investment officer at Bell Bank in Bloomington, Minnesota. \"So while volatility may pick up with the unknown heading into an Election Day, stocks tend to forge ahead as uncertainty fades.\"\n\nWhile the Fed is hitting the brakes on rate hikes (and yields tend to fall pretty quickly when that scenario occurs), market volatility already exacerbated by the election could be further triggered.\n\n\"This means cash carries reinvestment risk, and today's elevated bond yields offer an opportunity to lock in higher income potential for longer,\" J.P. Morgan Wealth Management investment strategists Madison Faller and Shawn Snyder said in a recent research note. \"We're most excited about municipal bonds, with their tax treatment offering an even bigger pick-up in yield alongside limited default risk.\"\n\nSteps to Crash-Proof Your Investment Portfolio in 2024\n\nDespite the Fed's \"higher for longer\" interest rate strategy that could hamper business and consumer finances in 2024, U.S. financial markets seem headed for a smooth landing this year.\n\n\"We aren't as confident about that, but we still see opportunities in a total-portfolio context,\" Kate El-Hillow, Russell Investments' president and chief investing officer, noted in the company's 2024 Global Market Outlook. \"Government bonds look valuable as yields exceed inflation and could become more appealing as a hedge against stock market volatility. We prefer quality equities for their relative value and defensive characteristics.\"\n\nReal estate investment trusts, or REITs, and global listed infrastructure are also attractive and \"should benefit from longer demographic and technology trends,\" El-Hillow said. Consumers should also focus on asset allocation as the year proceeds, as portfolio diversification and active management are big issues in what could be a volatile 2024 financial market landscape.\n\n\"This goes beyond stocks and bonds and addresses broader macro factors such as inflation, growth and trade,\" El-Hillow noted. \"Next-generation diversifiers such as real assets and private credit offer additional benefits in this context. As monetary policy changes, diversification within the growth side of portfolios will become more relevant, but elevated volatility will make it critical to be selective.\"\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to stock market breadth, one of the most important developments to watch in 2024 (i.e., the number of market indexes, sectors, styles and individual stocks that are participating in the stock market's uptrend.)\n\n\"At the end of the third quarter of 2023, small-cap, mid-cap and the average U.S. stock were all down year to date, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up largely due to their concentration in a small number of large-cap growth stocks,\" said Thomas Samuelson, chief investment officer at Vineyard Global Advisors in Castle Rock, Colorado. \"The encouraging development in the fourth quarter of 2023 is the rallies being seen in small-cap, mid-cap and the average U.S. stock, foreign developed and emerging stocks.\""}

In December alone, about 6 million U.S. citizens left the country for international destinations, 16% higher than the same month in 2019, according to the International Trade Administration . But some destinations warrant more caution than others.\n\nOn Oct. 19, following the outbreak of war between Israel and Gaza and flaring tensions in the region, the U.S. State Department issued a worldwide caution advisory due to \u201cincreased tensions in various locations around the world, the potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests.\u201d Prior to this update, the most recent worldwide caution advisory was issued in 2022 after a U.S. strike killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden\u2019s successor as leader of Al Qaeda, causing \u201ca higher potential for anti-American violence.\u201d The worldwide caution advisory remains in effect.\n\nThe U.S. State Department also issues individual travel advisory levels for more than 200 countries globally, continually updating them based on a variety of risk indicators such as health, terrorism and civil unrest. Travel advisory levels range from Level 1, which means exercise normal precautions, to Level 4, which means do not travel there.\n\nAbout 10% of countries \u2013 19 total \u2013 have a Level 4: \u201cDo Not Travel\u201d advisory as of Jan. 29. In Level 4 countries, the U.S. government may have \u201cvery limited ability\u201d to step in should travelers\u2019 safety or security be at risk, according to the State Department. Crime, civil unrest, kidnapping and terrorism are common risk factors associated with Level 4 countries.\n\nSo far in 2024, the State Department made changes to the existing Level 4 advisories for Myanmar, Iran and Gaza, and moved Niger and Lebanon off of the Level 4 list.\n\n\n\nPlaces With a Level 4 Travel Advisory\n\nThese are the primary areas the U.S. government says not to travel to right now, in alphabetical order:\n\n\n\nJump to Place: Afghanistan Belarus Burkina Faso Central African Republic Myanmar (formerly Burma) Gaza Haiti Iran Iraq Libya Mali Mexico North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) Russia Somalia South Sudan Sudan Syria Ukraine Venezuela Yemen\n\nBelarus: Belarus, which shares a western border with Russia and a southern border with Ukraine, has been flagged for \u201cBelarusian authorities\u2019 continued facilitation of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, the buildup of Russian military forces in Belarus, the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, the potential of civil unrest, the risk of detention, and the Embassy\u2019s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens residing in or traveling to Belarus.\u201d The U.S. Embassy in Minsk halted operations in February 2022.\n\nBurkina Faso: Terrorism, crime and kidnapping are plaguing this West African nation. Terrorist attacks may target hotels, restaurants and schools with little to no warning, and the East and Sahel regions of the country are under a state of emergency. In late November hundreds died in clashes between state security forces and rebels near the country\u2019s border with Mali. More than 2 million people in Burkina Faso are displaced due to \u201cviolence linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.\u201d\n\nCentral African Republic: While there have not been specific incidents of U.S. citizens targeted with violence or crime, violent crime and sudden closure of roads and borders is common. The advisory states that \u201cEmbassy Bangui\u2019s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens, crime, civil unrest, and kidnapping\u201d is a factor in its assessment. Recent data from UNICEF suggests the country has the worst drinking water accessibility of all countries in 2022.\n\nMyanmar (Formerly Burma): Armed conflict and civil unrest are the primary reasons to not travel to this Southeast Asian country, which experienced a military coup in early 2021. Limited health care resources, wrongful detentions and \u201careas with land mines and unexploded ordnance\u201d are also listed as risk factors. After Ukraine and Israel, Myanmar had the highest conflict-related death toll in 2023.\n\n\n\nGaza : Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization as designated by the State Department, controls much of the Gaza Strip, which shares borders with both Israel and Egypt. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas fighters broke across the border into Israel, killing hundreds of civilians and soldiers in a brazen attack that stunned Israelis. On Oct. 10, Israel hit the Gaza Strip with \u201cthe fiercest air strikes in its 75-year conflict\u201d according to Reuters . The conflict has since escalated into war between Israel and Hamas, with regular Israeli airstrikes leading to extensive civilian casualties in Gaza. As of mid-December, nearly 85% of Gaza\u2019s population were displaced from their homes, according to UN estimates . The region continues to face shortages of food , water, electricity and medical supplies , with conditions deemed \u201cfar beyond a humanitarian crisis.\u201d The State Department warns of terrorism and armed conflict within Gaza\u2019s borders.\n\nHaiti: In July 2023, the Department of State ordered all non-emergency U.S. government personnel and family members to leave the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince in response to the increased risk of kidnapping and violent crime in the country , as well as armed conflict between gangs and police. The travel advisory states that cases of kidnapping \u201coften involve ransom negotiations and U.S. citizen victims have been physically harmed during kidnappings.\u201d The travel advisory also states that \u201cU.S. citizens in Haiti should depart Haiti as soon as possible\u201d given \u201cthe current security situation and infrastructure challenges.\u201d A series of gang attacks in late September 2023 caused thousands to flee their homes, and many aid groups have been forced to cut or suspend operations amid escalating violence in recent months.\n\nIran: Terrorism, kidnapping and civil unrest are risk factors for all travelers to Iran, while U.S. citizens are specifically at risk for \u201carbitrary arrest.\u201d U.S.-Iranian nationals such as students, journalists and business travelers have been arrested on charges of espionage and threatening national security. Executions in Iran rose sharply between 2021 and 2022, bringing the country\u2019s total to nearly 580 people over the year, according to a report by Amnesty International released in May 2023.\n\nIraq: The State Department cites \u201cterrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict [and] civil unrest\u201d as cause for the country\u2019s Level 4 distinction. Iraq\u2019s northern borders, and its border with Syria, are especially dangerous. Since the escalation of conflict in neighboring Israel in October, there has been an increase in attacks against Iraqi military bases, which host U.S. troops and other international forces. On Oct. 20, non-emergency U.S. government personnel and eligible family members were ordered to leave the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.\n\nLibya: Following the end of its dictatorship over a decade ago, Libya has been wrought with internal conflict between armed groups in the East and West. Armed conflict, civil unrest, crime, kidnapping and terrorism are all risk factors. U.S. citizens have been targets of kidnapping for ransom, with terrorists targeting hotels and airports frequented by Westerners. The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli halted operations in 2014. In mid-September 2023, floods, which some say were intensified by climate change , killed thousands in eastern Libya. Clashes between armed factions escalated across the country in the latter half of 2023, including in the capital city of Tripoli and in Benghazi.\n\n\n\nMali: After experiencing military coups in 2020 and 2021, crime, terrorism and kidnapping are all prevalent threats in this West African landlocked nation. In July 2022, non-emergency U.S. government employees and their families were ordered to leave the country due to higher risk of terrorist activity. A U.N. report in August 2023 said that military groups in the country, including both Mali security forces and possibly Russian Wagner mercenaries, were spreading terror through the use of violence against women and human rights abuses. Democratic elections were supposed to occur in February 2024, but Mali\u2019s military junta postponed the plans indefinitely. In December, the U.N. officially ended a decade-long peacekeeping presence in the country, which had been among the agency\u2019s deadliest missions, with hundreds of the mission personnel killed since 2013.\n\nMexico: Each state in Mexico is assessed separately for travel advisory levels. Six of the 32 states in Mexico are designated as Level 4: Colima, Guerrero, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas and Zacatecas. Crime and kidnapping are listed as the primary risk factors throughout the country. Nearly 112,000 people were missing across the country as of October, a number the U.N. has called \u201calarming.\u201d\n\n\n\nNorth Korea (Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea): U.S. passports are not valid for travel \u201cto, in, or through\u201d this country, home to one of the world's longest-running dynastic dictatorships. The travel advisory states that the Level 4 distinction is due to \u201cthe continuing serious risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. nationals.\u201d In July 2023, a U.S. soldier fled across the border into North Korea, where he is believed to be in North Korean custody, the first American detained in the North in nearly five years. He was returned to U.S. custody in September 2023.\n\nRussia: The travel advisory for Russia cites its invasion of Ukraine , harassment of U.S. citizens by Russian government officials and arbitrary law enforcement as a few of the reasons for the Level 4 designation. Chechnya and Mount Elbrus are specifically listed as Level 4 regions. Terrorism, civil unrest, health, kidnapping and wrongful detention are all noted as risks.\n\nSomalia: A severe drought resulting from five failed rainy seasons in a row killed 43,000 people in 2022, and caused a famine amid conflict with Islamist insurgents . Violent crime is common throughout Somalia , pirates frequent its coast off the Horn of Africa, and medical facilities, where they exist, have limited capacity. Crime, terrorism, civil unrest, health and kidnapping are all risk factors. In January 2024, some passengers aboard a U.N.-contracted helicopter were taken hostage by al-Shabaab militants after the vehicle crashed in central Somalia.\n\nSouth Sudan: Crime, kidnapping and armed conflict are the primary risk factors for South Sudan, which separated from Sudan in 2011, making it the world\u2019s newest country . Weapons are readily available, and travelers have been victims of sexual assault and armed robbery.\n\nSudan: The U.S. evacuated its embassy in Khartoum in April 2023, and the country closed its airspace due to the ongoing conflict in the country, only permitting humanitarian aid and evacuation efforts. Fighting has escalated in the region between two warring generals seeking to gain control after a military coup in 2021 ousted the country\u2019s prime minister. Civil unrest is the primary risk factor for Africa\u2019s third largest country by area. Crime, terrorism, kidnapping and armed conflict are also noted. The International Criminal Court began investigating alleged war crimes and violence against African ethnic groups in the country in 2023. Millions have fled their homes due to conflict, and the U.N. has said its efforts to provide aid have been hindered by a lack of support, safety and resources. As recently as December 2023, the United Nations warned of catastrophic famine , with millions of children at-risk for malnutrition .\n\nSyria: The advisory states that \u201cNo part of Syria is safe from violence,\u201d with terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, armed conflict and risk of unjust detention all potential risk factors. U.S. citizens are often a target for kidnappings and detention. The U.S. Embassy in Damascus halted operations in 2012. Fighting in neighboring Israel has escalated since October, and the conflict has spilled over into Syria, where the U.S. has carried out air strikes following drone and rocket attacks against American troops in Syria and Iraq, triggered by the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nUkraine: Russian setbacks in their invasion of Ukraine buoyed hopes in Ukraine in 2023. However, Ukraine is a Level 4 country due to Russia\u2019s invasion, with crime and civil unrest also noted as risk factors. The country\u2019s forces shot down two Russian fighter jets on Christmas Eve 2023, in a move Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said \u201csets the right mood for the entire year ahead.\u201d\n\n\n\nVenezuela: Human rights abuses and lack of health care plague this South American nation, which has been in a political crisis since 2014. In 2019, diplomatic personnel were withdrawn from the U.S. Embassy in Caracas. Threats in the country include crime, civil unrest, kidnapping, wrongful detention and poor health infrastructure.\n\nYemen: Six of the nine risk factors defined by the State Department \u2013 terrorism, civil unrest, health risks, kidnapping, armed conflict and landmines \u2013 are all present in Yemen. Despite private companies offering tourist visits to the Yemeni island of Socotra, the U.S. government argues those arranging such visits \u201care putting tourists in danger.\u201d Civil war and cholera are also both present throughout the country. The U.S. Embassy in Sanaa halted operations in 2015. The country has experienced a relative lull in the civil war fighting, but as peace negotiations have gotten traction, flare ups in the fighting have jeopardized progress. Most recently, the U.S. and U.K. have carried out a series of airstrikes in the country, targeting Iran-backed Houthi sites.\n\nOther Countries to Watch\n\nSince Jan. 1, the State Department has updated travel advisories for 14 different countries as well as for the West Bank and Gaza, adding information about specific regions or risk factors, or simply renewing an existing advisory. Travel advisory levels can change based on several factors in a nation, such as increased civil unrest, policies that affect human rights or higher risks of unlawful detention.\n\n\n\nThe State Department has given about 25 countries an assessment of Level 3, meaning it recommends people \u201creconsider travel\u201d to those destinations.\n\nOn Oct. 14, one week after the deadly Hamas attack on Israel, Israel and the West Bank were both moved from Level 2 to Level 3, while Gaza remains at Level 4. The region\u2019s travel advisory was updated again in November to reflect travel restrictions for certain government employees who have not already left the area, and it was updated again on Jan. 3.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in early October, the U.S. State Department raised Lebanon \u2019s travel advisory level from a Level 3 to a Level 4 level due to \u201cthe unpredictable security situation related to rocket, missile, and artillery exchanges\u201d between Israel and Hezbollah or other militant groups. In December, the U.S. Embassy in Beirut returned to normal staffing and presence, and on Jan. 29, the country was moved back to Level 3. Crime, terrorism, armed conflict, civil unrest, kidnapping and unexploded landmines are listed as the country\u2019s primary risk factors. However, the country\u2019s borders with Syria and with Israel, as well as refugee settlements within Lebanon, are specifically noted as Level 4 regions.\n\nChina became a Level 3 country in late 2020, with an update in December 2022 citing \u201cthe surge in COVID-19 cases, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, and COVID-19-related restrictions\u201d as the reason for the advisory. In June 2023, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) was moved from the Level 3 to the Level 2 list, but travelers are still advised to be cautious in the area due to \u201carbitrary enforcement of local laws.\u201d Meanwhile, Macau remains at Level 3.\n\nFollowing an attempted coup in August 2023, Niger was elevated to Level 4 in August and the Department of State ordered all non-emergency U.S. government personnel and family members to leave the U.S. Embassy in Niamey. In early January 2024, the overall risk level for the country was lowered back to Level 3. Despite the new classification, the State Department still asks non-emergency government personnel and eligible family members to depart the country.\n\nIn mid-December 2023 there was an explosion at Guinea\u2019s main fuel depot which has since affected access to health care and basic goods and services. The country was subsequently designated a Level 3 nation after having previously been Level 2. Concerns about civil unrest, health, crime and fuel shortages impacting local infrastructure were listed as the primary risk factors contributing to the change.\n\nSeveral Level 3 countries are among the worst countries for human trafficking, as designated by the State Department\u2019s annual Trafficking in Persons Report . Level 3 countries on this list include Papua New Guinea, Guinea Bissau, China and Chad. There are also nine Level 4 countries designated as among the worst for human trafficking: Afghanistan, Belarus, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Syria, South Sudan and Venezuela.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Worst Countries for Human Trafficking\n\nOver 70 countries are currently at Level 2, meaning the State Department recommends travelers \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d when traveling to those destinations.\n\nSweden is designated a Level 2 country, with terrorism noted as the primary risk factor in the country. France, which saw nationwide protests throughout 2023, has civil unrest and terrorism noted as risk factors for its Level 2 status.\n\nThe Level 2 travel advisory for the Bahamas was updated in January to reflect water safety concerns. The advisory warns that \u201cactivities involving commercial recreational watercraft, including water tours, are not consistently regulated\u201d and notes that government personnel are \u201cnot permitted to use independently operated jet-ski rentals on New Providence and Paradise Islands.\u201d It also warns visitors to be mindful of sharks, weather and water conditions. The advisory also says that crime is a primary risk factor with gang-on-gang violence contributing to high homicide rates in some areas. Visitors are asked to \u201cbe vigilant\u201d and to not physically resist robbery attempts.\n\nBangladesh 's Level 2 travel advisory was updated in October 2023 to add a note about the country\u2019s upcoming general election Jan. 7, 2024. The advisory states \u201cdemonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.\u201d\n\nIn November, several Level 2 travel advisories were updated with new cautionary information. The advisory for Ghana was updated in November 2023 to reflect threats against LGBTQI+ travelers specifically, noting \u201canti-LGBTQI+ rhetoric and violence have increased in recent years.\u201d Meanwhile, the advisory for South Africa now notes that routes recommended by GPS may be unsafe with higher risk for crime.\n\nTurkmenistan was moved off of the Level 2 list to become the newest addition to the Level 1 list on Jan. 22, meaning normal precautions are recommended but there are no risk factors causing travelers to practice increased caution."}

For buyers, a purchase could mean their first leg up on the housing ladder, as well as finding more space and a better location. For sellers, a sale could mean downsizing from a large house, upgrading to a home with more space due to a growing family or even having to sell due to the \"three D's\": death, divorce and debt.\n\nBuyers, in particular, would be most interested in finding a home they consider undervalued for a variety of reasons, such as an up-and-coming location not yet on the radar of real estate agents, a well-designed home in need of some TLC or even a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) suffering through job losses. If they do opt for a home considered overvalued, that could be due to a rare find in a great neighborhood or school district in which they plan to spend many years.\n\nSometimes, however, undervalued homes are located in a MSA with a healthy job market, plenty of interesting cultural opportunities and other amenities. For our analysis, we're focusing on those MSAs with home prices and rents below what they should be based on local incomes, which could mean further upsides for homebuyers and investors.\n\n\n\nWhat Does Undervalued Mean?\n\nA general rule from the Department of Housing and Urban Development states that households spending more than 30% of their gross monthly incomes on a place to live are \"cost burdened.\" This burden has become even more important given the inflation spike U.S consumers have experienced over the last 2.5 years and leaves even less room for spending on other necessities of life, such as food, clothing, transportation and health insurance.\n\nFor our rankings of overvalued and undervalued markets, instead of household income we look more closely at local per capita incomes since that's considered by some to be a better measure of an area's wealth. Overvalued and undervalued markets are those in which households are respectively paying far more or less on their housing costs compared with the national per capita income.\n\nAs these are national figures, these ratios can vary widely between markets, with some homeowners paying up to two-thirds or more of local per capita incomes for principal and interest alone, and renters paying well over half.\n\nAlternatively, some homeowners and renters are paying less than one-quarter of local per capita incomes on principal and interest or rent. As a result, with many homeowners and renters paying much less than the ratio of housing costs to U.S. per capita income, a number of MSAs are undervalued based on local earnings.\n\n\n\nHow Home Prices Changed During and After the Pandemic\n\nIn the pre-pandemic days of late 2019 and early 2020, on a national level the U.S. housing market was still fairly balanced. With a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rate of 3.6%, the typical homeowner was paying just 22% of monthly per capita income on mortgage payments. At the same time, the typical tenant was paying a much higher 33% of monthly per capita income in rent, thereby providing a great incentive for them to dive into homeownership.\n\nHowever, by the end of 2023, while the share of monthly per capita incomes paid by tenants to landlords edged up to 34%, for homeowners it soared to 39%. This rise was mostly due to mortgage rates briefly jumping to nearly 7.8% before gradually falling and recently ranging from 6.6% to 6.9%.\n\nNotably, new markets added to the Housing Market Index since last November include Albuquerque, New Mexico, and two MSAs in Hawaii, including Kahului-Wailuku-Lahaina and urban Honolulu.\n\nFor this analysis, monthly housing costs below the national median per capita income for owning (39.1%) or renting (34.4%) indicate an undervalued market. Our data for these rankings are primarily sourced from the U.S. News Housing Market Index, an interactive platform providing a data-driven overview of housing markets nationwide.\n\nThese rankings are based on data from November 2023, which is the most recent and comprehensive data from the index. If you're following various housing markets, check back with the online interface for updates at least once per month. See the methodology here.\n\n\n\nUndervalued Homes for Sale\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market to purchase a home, the following five MSAs are the most undervalued, with a payment-to-per capita income ratio below 26% and as low as 18%. This ratio is well below the national average of just over 39%:\n\n\n\nDetroit: 18.0%\n\nCleveland: 20.6%\n\nPhiladelphia: 20.8%\n\nSt. Louis: 21.0%\n\nOklahoma City: 25.5%\n\nEven if former Rust Belt cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis and Oklahoma City are again topping the list of the most undervalued markets in which to buy a home, in more recent years some of them have successfully revitalized their economies and attracted new businesses due to relatively low costs of doing business. For the Detroit MSA, the median payment-to-income ratio of 18% is less than half the 39% ratio for the overall U.S.\n\nThe Most Undervalued MSA to Buy a Home\n\nThe Detroit MSA has a variety of strengths, such as a low unemployment rate, few foreclosures and the country\u2019s lowest mortgage payment-to-per capita income ratio. However, weaknesses include a low ratio of building permits to household growth and a sharp jump in the rental vacancy rate, which more than doubled from 5.2% to 11.4% in the 12 months prior to September 2023.\n\nAccording to an economic forecast through 2028 by the University of Michigan, Detroit's economy will continue to see steady growth in the years ahead with more jobs and higher wages for area residents. Although job growth won't rival fast-growing regions in states such as Texas and Florida, steady growth year after year is still a testament to the city's economic strategy to diversify and move away from mostly being known as the Motor City.\n\nDetroit may not be the most undervalued area for long, given the MSA had the highest year-over-year price gain through November, according to the widely followed 20-city S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index in a Jan. 30 report.\n\n\"Once again, Detroit reported the highest year-over-year gain among the 20 cities with an 8.2% increase in November, followed again by San Diego with an 8% increase,\" the report said.\n\nThe following is a deeper look at the various data points regularly tracked by the Housing Market Interface for this MSA:\n\nU.S. News\n\nThe overall Housing Market Index of 61.1 for the Detroit MSA fell by 2.3 year-over-year through October and is comprised of three subindexes on a 1-100 point scale, with 100 being the healthiest.\n\n\n\nDemand HMI \u2013 53.9\n\nSupply HMI \u2013 36.9\n\nFinancial \u2013 92.5\n\nLearn more about these subindexes and the data points they track.\n\nThe median price in the Detroit MSA fell 1.2% over the past year to $172,000, which is the lowest among the MSAs currently tracked by the Housing Market Index. Despite falling prices, housing supply has fallen by 0.5 months over the last year to 2.7 months. This level of supply is at least one-half of what is generally considered a balanced housing market.\n\nFor now, the rates of mortgage delinquencies in the Detroit area nearly match those at the national level, although these rates could rise if homeowners begin to struggle with higher bills for property taxes and property insurance. However, foreclosures remain at low levels which are also half the national average.\n\nU.S. News\n\nU.S. News\n\nOnce totaling over 1,000 and even sometimes 1,500 units per month 20 years ago, single-family detached building permits have ranged from 400 to 600 per month. Looking ahead through the first two months of 2024, they're forecast to range from 250 to 350 per month.\n\nPermits for multifamily homes, which typically ranged 300 to 400 units per month 20 years ago, plummeted to well under 100 per month in the wake of the financial crisis. In more recent years, multifamily permits have risen to as high as 400 per month, but totals can be volatile from month to month. Peering ahead further into 2024, multifamily permits activity is forecast to hover close to 150 per month.\n\nU.S. News\n\nU.S. News\n\nUndervalued Homes for Rent\n\nIf you\u2019re among the growing number of potential buyers waiting to decide on the right time to jump into the housing market, you may live in an MSA with a rent-to-income ratio far below the national median of 34.4%. In terms of undervalued rental housing markets, this list is led again by several markets in the Midwest in which this ratio ranges from about 24% to 26% of local per capita incomes:\n\n\n\nOmaha, Nebraska: 21.0%\n\nSt. Louis: 21.3%\n\nIndianapolis: 23.9%\n\nCleveland: 24.0%\n\nOklahoma City: 24.4%\n\nWhile Detroit is ranked as the 10th most undervalued market for buying a home, the lowest ratios for renting one are found in the greater Omaha (21.0%) and St. Louis (21.3%) areas. Other MSAs with rent-to-per capita income ratios below the national average of 34.4% include the other Midwest regions of Indianapolis, Cleveland and Oklahoma City. Interestingly, San Jose, California, also ranks as a relatively low-cost market for renters due to a high per capita income and a rent-to-per capita income ratio of 25.2%.\n\n\n\nThe Most Undervalued MSAs to Rent a Home\n\nThe Omaha MSA is ranked as one of the most undervalued regions to rent a home because its rental rates remain a bargain even after increases over nearly 6% from the past year.\n\nThe following is a deeper look at the various data points regularly tracked by the Housing Market Interface for this MSA:\n\nU.S. News\n\nThe overall Housing Market Index of 64.1 for the Omaha MSA edged up 2.22 year-over-year through October, with the subindexes ranging from 41.1 to 95.6 on a scale of 1-100:\n\n\n\nDemand HMI \u2013 55.5\n\nSupply HMI \u2013 41.1\n\nFinancial HMI \u2013 95.6\n\nBesides its low payment- and rent-to-income ratios, Omaha\u2019s strengths also include a low rental vacancy rate of just 3.1%, making it potentially attractive to investors. However, some of its weaknesses include housing permits not keeping up with household growth and low housing supply for sale of just 2.0 months.\n\nBy November 2023, even though the median observed rent price in the Omaha MSA rose 5.9% year-over-year to $1,293, it was still the lowest rent of the MSAs currently tracked by the Housing Market Index and compares with a median monthly mortgage payment of $1,961.\n\nOwning Vs. Renting\n\nFor those potential homebuyers looking for the best time to purchase a home, another metric to study is the difference between the cost of owning versus renting in a particular MSA. Whereas the difference between these ratios at the national level is about 4.7% (and up from just 0.9% a year ago) for the most undervalued market the cost to own can be up to 8% less than renting.\n\nThe following five MSAs are markets in which the cost to own is about 2% to 8% less than renting:\n\n\n\nDetroit: -8.1%\n\nPhiladelphia: -7.8%\n\nCleveland: -3.5%\n\nChicago: -2.4%\n\nColumbia, South Carolina: -1.7%\n\nMethodology\n\nThe U.S. News Housing Market Index is the most comprehensive collection of data points for the country\u2019s largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas also easily available for free on the Internet. This data is sourced from a variety of government and private sources and is referenced by clicking the i button next to an interface heading.\n\nThe overall index includes four subindexes:\n\nThe Demand HMI includes government data on employment, unemployment, household growth, consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, median home sales prices from Redfin and observed, smoothed housing rental prices from Zillow.\n\nThe Supply HMI includes government data on housing supply, rental vacancy rates, construction costs, construction jobs, builder sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders and architectural billings from the American Institute of Architects.\n\nThe Financial HMI includes government data on interest rates and access to credit, delinquencies and foreclosures from Black Knight, and ratios of monthly mortgage and rental payments to per capita incomes calculated by the index. Monthly mortgage payments assume conventional financing with 20% down at the average monthly 30-year fixed rate reported by Freddie Mac."}

Among the most notable is the playing surface.\n\nBecause the Raiders insist on playing on grass, even in a dome, the field spends most of the time outside in sunlight and is rolled in on a tray for games. Last year's Super Bowl host, the Arizona Cardinals' stadium, uses a similar transfer system.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nThe NFL takes over management of the field when it comes to the Super Bowl, and the playing surface is monitored closely. No one wants a repeat of what happened last year in Glendale. Players slipped on that grass in the Super Bowl, which the Chiefs won 38-35 over the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\u201cThis surface has been nurtured from the sod farm all the way to the Super Bowl,\u201d said Jeff Miller, NFL executive vice president for communications. \u201cIts maintenance is measured by a series of tools and metrics. ... Our field manager expert has been on top of this for many weeks and is on site frequently and will be throughout the next couple of weeks in anticipation of the game.\u201d\n\nOther notable stadium features include:\n\n\u2014 Huge lanai doors on the north end facing Interstate 15 and the Strip. Those doors, which are 80 by 215 feet, can be opened to create more of an outdoor element, but have remained closed during Raiders games even late in the season when temperatures cool.\n\n\u2014 The Al Davis Memorial Torch is 92 feet high and surrounded by a circular bar. It's an electronic torch \u201clit\u201d before every Raiders home game. Former heavyweight champion and current Henderson resident Mike Tyson and recording artist and actor Ice Cube were among those who turned on the torch this season. The NHL's Vegas Golden Knights and the WNBA's Las Vegas Aces also had the honors after winning their leagues' championships.\n\nThe tradition traces back to 2011 when John Madden lit an actual torch when the team was based in Oakland, California. Another torch remains lit outside the Raiders headquarters in Henderson, Nevada.\n\n\u2014 In front of the torch, in an area that overlooks the end zone seats, the Raiders' 19-person band performs before games and plays in timeouts throughout.

(AP) \u2014 Lee Hoffman\u2019s job is challenging in the best of circumstances.\n\nIn most presidential election years, the chairman of the Republican Party in Elko County, Nevada, is tasked with rounding up voters to help choose a presidential nominee at the GOP caucuses. It\u2019s a complicated operation in a county of ranches and mining communities spread across an area larger than Massachusetts and Connecticut combined. His success sometimes hinges on how many people pick up the phone when he calls, or how many friends of friends he bumps into at the local supermarket.\n\nThis year, Hoffman\u2019s work has been even more difficult. For the first time, he must help voters understand Nevada will have two contests over the course of three days \u2014 and only one that counts toward who is the GOP nominee.\n\nThat\u2019s because a state law requires Nevada to hold a primary election, but the Nevada GOP voted to hold their own caucuses, or party-run meetings open to Republicans only. The party will only award delegates needed to win the nomination through the caucuses, rendering the state-run presidential primary purely symbolic.\n\nNevada voters have received mail ballots for the Feb. 6 primary that don\u2019t list front-runner Donald Trump\u2019s name. Why? Trump is competing in the party-run caucuses on Feb. 8, when he is poised to take all the state\u2019s delegates on a march toward the nomination.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nIt\u2019s Hoffman\u2019s job to sort it all out for voters, including the people who call wanting to know why Trump isn\u2019t on their ballot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy task, and I don\u2019t have a panacea for it,\u201d said Hoffman, 72, a former engineer for a mining company and city council member.\n\nHow is this peculiar arrangement even possible? Blame the Founding Fathers and the federal system of government they embraced in the Constitution. Outside of a few guiding principles, such as the Electoral College, the nation\u2019s founding charter leaves the mechanics of running elections to the states. And there are 50 of them, plus the District of Columbia, each led over the years by lawmakers with their own ideas about how votes should be cast and counted.\n\nFurther complicating matters, it\u2019s largely up to political parties to decide how their presidential nominee should be chosen. Some state parties choose to award delegates based on the results of government-run primaries, while others go for party-run caucuses. Then some, such as Nevada this year as well as Michigan, Missouri and a few others, end up with both.\n\nCritics say the Nevada GOP\u2019s new rules were designed to favor Trump and stack the deck against his rivals, most of whom have left the race as it turns to Nevada.\n\nOf the major candidates still in the race, only former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley chose to run in the primary, though a win won\u2019t give her delegates needed for the nomination. She has essentially ceded Nevada, instead looking ahead to South Carolina, where she served as governor.\n\n\u201cTalk to the people in Nevada: They will tell you the caucuses have been sealed up, bought and paid for,\u201d Haley told reporters in New Hampshire, where she finished second to Trump in the Jan.23 primary. \u201dThat\u2019s the Trump train rolling through that. But we\u2019re going to focus on the states that are fair.\u201d\n\nThe state GOP, like others across the U.S., is led by Trump loyalists determined to take election processes into their own hands. Three Nevada GOP leaders overseeing the caucuses have been indicted on felony charges that they were so-called fake electors who sent certificates to Congress falsely claiming Trump won Nevada in 2020.\n\nThe rule changes also have caused rifts within the state party, with even the Republican governor worrying the dueling elections will confuse voters and decrease turnout. Others feared frustration with the process and bad publicity could hurt Nevada\u2019s reputation as an early presidential nominating state. Nevada is the third state to vote in the GOP contest.\n\nWill Bradley, a Nevada GOP central committee member, has been involved in state parties in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina dating back to 2007. He opposed holding the caucuses but is now helping to organize them.\n\n\u201c(This is) the most confusing and significant debacle I\u2019ve ever seen in Republican politics,\u201d Bradley said.\n\nPRIMARY OR CAUCUSES: WHAT\u2019S THE DIFFERENCE?\n\nStates typically use either a primary or caucuses to vote for a presidential nominee.\n\nCaucuses are party-run meetings that require voters to show up in-person at a set day and time, sometimes for hours. Turnout is typically much lower than in a primary, and leans heavily on party activists.\n\nA primary is an election run by the government at the state and local level, where voters cast ballots on election day or in other ways permitted under local law, such as by mail-in ballot. It\u2019s considered more inclusive than caucuses because it doesn\u2019t require people to attend in person at a certain place and time \u2014 often for hours.\n\nFor years, Nevada held nominating caucuses. But the Democratic-controlled state government in 2021 approved a law that requires the state to hold a primary starting this year.\n\nNevada GOP leaders say they prefer party-run caucuses because they want rules in place, such as requiring voter ID and paper ballots, that Democrats wouldn\u2019t approve for the state-run primary.\n\nRepublican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who took office after the law establishing the primary and its rules was signed, also tried to require voter ID for state elections. Though he was unsuccessful, he still has denounced the Nevada GOP\u2019s plan to award delegates through caucuses, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d and saying it will disenfranchise voters.\n\nStill, Nevada GOP Chairman Michael McDonald has forged ahead with the caucuses. McDonald was among the six Nevada Republicans indicted for falsely certifying Trump won the state in 2020.\n\nHe has introduced the former president at multiple events in the state this election cycle, including at a Las Vegas rally in late January. Each time, McDonald has urged supporters to make plans to attend their caucus to back Trump.\n\n\u201cYou give us a fair election,\u201d McDonald told voters at rallies in Reno and Las Vegas, \u201cI\u2019ll give you the next president of the United States \u2014 Donald J. Trump.\u201d\n\nHOW DO NEW RULES FAVOR TRUMP?\n\nTrump himself told the crowd at the January rally to ignore the primary and attend the caucuses instead, saying \u201cYour primary vote doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\n\nA Nevada GOP rule states that any candidate who participates in the state-run primary may not run in the caucuses.\n\nBut Republican voters may participate in both contests. In another twist, primary voters will have the option to choose \u201cNone of these candidates.\u201d So it\u2019s possible Haley will receive fewer votes than the \u201cnone of these\u201d option.\n\nLombardo, a Trump supporter, said he planned to vote for \u201cNone of these\u201d in the primary and then back Trump in the caucuses.\n\nTrump and former Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis were among the major candidates who chose the caucuses. But DeSantis dropped out, leaving Trump without a major challenger for the caucuses \u2013 and Nevada\u2019s delegates.\n\nEven before many of his rivals left the race, the caucus format was widely seen as benefitting Trump, who has a solid grip on the GOP\u2019s most loyal voters.\n\nTrump and his political team have spent years building his grassroots support and cultivating relationships with party leaders, issuing endorsements in their leadership races and encouraging parties to adopt rules that benefit a well-organized, front-runner candidate like himself.\n\nAhead of the 2024 contest, Trump hosted state party officials at his homes, and his political aides nudged state parties \u2014 in Nevada and elsewhere \u2014 toward changes that tilted the nomination fight in Trump\u2019s favor.\n\nTrump allies leading the Michigan GOP, for example, adopted a new plan to award some delegates in a primary and others in closed-door caucus meetings four days later. California Republicans also made a last-minute rule change, pushed by Trump\u2019s team, that says any candidate who wins a majority of votes in the March 5 primary will pick up all of the state\u2019s delegates \u2013 a bar Trump could clear.\n\nIn Nevada, the state party also approved rules restricting super PACs, like the one DeSantis was relying on to turn out voters, from trying to bolster support for candidates in the caucuses.\n\nBradley, who supports Trump, still believes the new rules gave the former president an unfair advantage. He worries confusion over the process may hurt Nevada\u2019s political reputation, and he wants his party to direct its energy toward November, when Nevada is expected to again be a presidential election battleground.\n\n\u201cThis is a state Trump has lost twice in the general election, and we got to get our act together to get him across the finish line this time,\u201d Bradley said.\n\nWHAT CHALLENGES REMAIN?\n\nOut in rural Elko County, Lee Hoffman is optimistic about his outreach, even if it\u2019s tougher to spread the word \u2014 and for voters to participate in caucuses \u2014 than it is in cities such as Las Vegas or Reno.\n\nThe county, which borders Idaho and Utah, is so far from major Nevada cities that the \u201clocal\u201d news stations are from Salt Lake City. Some towns are over 100 miles away from other communities, and 12 of the 42 precincts are so remote they solely use mail ballots for voting in state-run elections.\n\nHoffman is relying largely on connections he\u2019s made on the city council and in GOP politics. He has distributed flyers around Elko, visited local businesses to spread the word and used radio spots and phone calls to reach voters.\n\nStill, the calls have been coming in with confused residents wondering: Why isn\u2019t Trump on the primary ballot they just received in the mail?\n\n\u201cSpreading that word is probably the most difficult thing,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nPrice reported from New York.

The growing romance between the couple has been closely watched, with Swift showing up at several games\u2014which has meant much travel on private jets. The chatter got even louder the last few days after the Chiefs beat the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, sending them to the Super Bowl, which is in Las Vegas on Feb. 11.\n\nSwift, the hitmaker whose dominance of pop culture now includes the first tour to gross more than $1 billion, is the latest in a long list of celebrities, government officials and elite businesspeople to come under scrutiny about private jet travel. A look at Swift's recent travel, carbon dioxide emissions from private jets versus commercial planes and one of the most common, albeit controversial, solutions floated to address such pollution.\n\nSWIFT'S CARBON FOOTPRINT\n\nIf Swift attends the Super Bowl, she will be traveling from Tokyo, where she is on tour. That will mean more than 19,400 miles (30,500 kilometers) by private jet in just under two weeks. Just how much carbon dioxide will that be?\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nWhile exact carbon emissions depend on many factors, such as flight paths and number of passengers, a rough estimate is possible, said Gregory Keoleian, co-director of the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan. Traveling 19,400 miles on a Dassault Falcon 900LX, one of Swift's jets, could release more than 200,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions, he said.\n\nThat would be about 14 times as much as the average American household emits in a year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nHow realistic commercial travel would be for Swift is open for debate. After all, she's so famous that, even if she wanted to, flying on commercial flights might be chaotic for an airline crew and any public airport she frequents. Keoleian said there are other important ways that public figures flying private can address climate change, such as through their influence on public attitudes and perceptions, investments and who they vote for.\n\nThe controversy over Swift's use of private jets illustrates the \u201cgreat disparity\u201d between the wealthy and lower-income people when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions each person generates, said Julia Stein, a professor at University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing this play out on kind of a microcosmic scale (with Swift), but that\u2019s true too of industrialized countries their carbon emissions historically,\" she said.\n\nOTHERS SCRUTINIZED\n\nSwift is the latest of many famous people to be scrutinized over pollution from their globe-trotting. Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Leonardo DiCaprio and many others have periodically gotten attention for their travel on private jets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s striking that Ms. Swift gets so much of the outrage when private jet customers are overwhelmingly men over 50,\u201d said Jeff Colgan, a professor of political science at Brown University. \u201cThe focus really should be on a broader class of people.\u201d\n\nBig events, from Olympic Games to the annual U.N. climate summit have also been criticized because of the thousands of people flying in to attend, travel that all contributes to climate change.\n\nAll air travel creates emissions, though private jets produce much more per person. A 2023 study by the Institute for Policy Studies found that private jets emit at least 10 times more pollutants per passenger compared to commercial planes.\n\nCARBON OFFSETS\n\nOne often discussed way to address air travel pollution is paying for carbon offsets, which aim to balance out emissions released. For example, trees pull carbon out of the air, so offset programs include planting trees that, at least in theory, balance out pollution from air travel.\n\nGates has defended his travel by private plane by saying he purchases offsets and supports clean technology and other sustainability initiatives. Swift\u2019s publicist did not respond to a query from The Associated Press, but told The Washington Post that the singer purchases offsets. The publicist didn't provide details.\n\nStill, there are many questions about the effectiveness of offsets. They are loosely regulated and investigations by news organizations in recent years have shown some programs overestimate how much carbon is being captured or have questionable practices.\n\n\u201cOffsets are still the Wild West of climate change and have been riddled with fraud, failed projects, and dubious effectiveness,\" said Jonathan Foley, executive director of Project Drawdown, a group that publicizes climate solutions. \u201cPlanting trees, for example, might work \u2014 or not \u2014 depending on how the forests are managed in the long run.\u201d\n\nFoley, along with many climate scientists and policy experts, argue that instead of offsets for air travel, it would be much better to sharply reduce the use of planes, particularly of private jets, while developing cleaner fuels. Several airline companies are also developing planes that are powered by electricity, and thus will not have emissions.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Reuters was the first to reveal the letter.\n\nThe FAA, acting after a mid-air cabin panel blowout on a new Alaska Airlines MAX 9, says it will audit all elements of production at Boeing and fuselage production at Spirit AeroSystems.\n\nIn the letter, the legislators asked FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker to answer whether - before or after the accident - the agency found \"any evidence of persistent quality control lapses in any of Boeing's production lines\".\n\nIt was signed by House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chair Sam Graves and Rick Larsen, the top Democrat on the committee, along with Representative Garret Graves, the chair of the aviation subcommittee and Democrat Steve Cohen.\n\nWhitaker is set to testify Tuesday before the aviation subcommittee. An FAA spokesperson said the agency would respond to the letter.\n\n\"Is the FAA considering any changes to its broader on-site surveillance of Boeing's and its suppliers' manufacturing processes to help ensure its products conform to their type design?\" the letter said.\n\n\"What changes, if any, is the FAA considering to its current risk model for inspecting production facilities?\"\n\nThe FAA has scrutinized Boeing's quality and other issues in recent years as it faced harsh criticism for its actions in the run-up to the MAX certification. Following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, the FAA grounded the plane for 20 months and mandated significant software and training improvements.\n\nThe FAA says a team of two dozen aviation safety inspectors will conduct the new audit at the Boeing 737 facility in Renton, Washington, and at Spirit in Wichita, Kansas. The audit will also examine how Boeing transfers unfinished work from suppliers to its production lines.\n\nThe letter also asked whether the FAA was considering further action on Safety Management Systems (SMS) requirements \"for aircraft part suppliers or other entities involved in aircraft manufacturing not captured by current regulations.\"\n\nThe SMS are a set of policies and procedures to proactively identify and address potential operational hazards early on.\n\nIn March last year, the FAA told Congress it was ramping up oversight of Boeing following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe FAA grounded 171 MAX 9 jets on Jan. 6, resulting in thousands of flight cancellations by Alaska Airlines and United Airlines. The grounding was lifted on Jan. 24.\n\nThe letter also asked whether airlines were able to receive the information they needed to ensure they could plan ahead and minimize potential operating disruptions.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson, editing by David Ljunggren and Nick Zieminski)"}

The Senate judiciary committee had summoned five CEOs to a hearing titled Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis. There was Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, TikTok\u2019s Shou Zi Chew, Snapchat\u2019s Evan Spiegel, Discord\u2019s Jason Citron and X\u2019s Linda Yaccarino \u2013 and a predictable vibe of \u201cSenator, I\u2019m a parent myself \u2026\u201d Listen, these moguls simply want to provide the tools to help families and friends connect with each other. Why must human misery and untold, tax-avoidant billions attend them at every turn?\n\nIf you did see footage from the hearing, it was probably one of two moments of deliberately clippable news content. Ranking committee member Lindsey Graham addressed Zuckerberg with the words: \u201cI know you don\u2019t mean it to be so, but you have blood on your hands.\u201d Well, ditto, Senator. \u201cYou have a product that is killing people,\u201d continued Graham, who strangely has yet to make the same point to the makers of whichever brand of AR-15 he proudly owns, or indeed to the makers of the assault rifles responsible for another record high of US school shootings last year. Firearms fatalities are the number one cause of death among US children and teenagers, a fact the tech CEOs at this hearing politely declined to mention, because no one likes a whatabouterist. And after all, the point of these things is to just get through the posturing of politicians infinitely less powerful than you, then scoot back to behaving precisely as you were before. Zuckerberg was out of there in time to report bumper results and announce Meta\u2019s first ever dividend on Thursday. At time of writing, its shares were soaring.\n\nAnyhow, if it wasn\u2019t that clip, maybe it was the one of Zuckerberg being goaded by sedition fist-pumper Josh Hawley into apologising to those in the committee room audience who had lost children to suicide following exploitation on his platform. Thanks to some stagey prodding by Senator Hawley, who famously encouraged the mob on 6 January 2020 (before later being filmed running away from them after they stormed the Capitol), Zuckerberg turned round, stood up, and faced his audience of the bereaved. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything you\u2019ve all gone through,\u201d he began. Helpfully, a transcribed version of this off-the-cuff moment found its way into a Meta press release minutes after the event.\n\nView image in fullscreen Republican Lindsey Graham speaks during the Senate judiciary committee\u2019s hearing on online child safety, 31 January 2024. Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nSo I guess that was the hearing. \u201cTense\u201d, \u201cheated\u201d, \u201cstunning\u201d \u2013 listen, if adjectival cliches were legislation, this exercise would have been something more than pointless. And yet, they\u2019re not and it wasn\u2019t. There really ought to be a genre name for this kind of performative busywork \u2013 the theatre of failure, perhaps.\n\nOther outcomes were once available. Back in 1994, the CEOs of seven big tobacco firms took their oaths before a Senate committee, then spouted a communal line that nicotine wasn\u2019t addictive. Within two years, all seven had quit the tobacco industry \u2013 a development not unrelated to the fact that all seven were under investigation by the justice department for perjury. Those were different times, and not just because we probably wouldn\u2019t slap them with the \u201cseven dwarfs\u201d moniker now. These days, you can\u2019t escape the sense that old guys were shouting at Zuckerberg at a hearing six years ago, while he offered 2018\u2019s variation on his favourite blandishment: \u201cWe know we have more work to do\u201d. And you suspect they\u2019ll be shouting at him again in five years\u2019 time, when he will still know they have more work to do. \u201cIf you\u2019re waiting on these guys to solve the problem,\u201d sniffed Graham of the tech CEOs, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna die waiting.\u201d Again, the senator speaks of what he knows. There is always talk of legislation, but there is never really much legislation.\n\nThere\u2019s a line near the start of the movie version of Ready Player One, the cult dystopian book about a VR world that weirdly feels like the lodestar for Zuckerberg\u2019s pivot towards the metaverse: \u201cI was born in 2027,\u201d explains the teenage protagonist, \u201cafter the corn syrup droughts, after the bandwidth riots \u2026 after people stopped trying to fix problems, and just tried to outlive them.\u201d It was hard to watch any amount of Wednesday\u2019s hearing \u2013 it\u2019s hard to watch a lot of news about the intersection of politics and mega-business these days, in fact \u2013 and not feel we are in a very similar place. Few of the politicians giving it the hero act could be said to have left the world in a better place than the one in which they found it when they took office. A necrotic form of politics has gripped the Republican party in particular, and this is the vacuum in which they have been downgraded by corporations they don\u2019t even understand, let alone have the will, foresight, or political skill to control.\n\n\u201cCompanies over countries,\u201d as Mark Zuckerberg said a long time ago. This once-unformed thought becomes more realised all the time, with the Meta boss last year explaining that, \u201cIncreasingly, the real world is a combination of the physical world we inhabit and the digital world we are building.\u201d The added irony is that the more the Lindsey Grahams fail the real world, the more people retreat further into the unregulated embrace of the worlds that the Mark Zuckerbergs run. It\u2019s going to take so much more than the theatre of failure to solve it \u2013 but bad actors currently dominate the bill."}

Dacorum council and many others class the act as a littering offence.\n\nA Royal Society for Public Health survey in 2019 found that three in four people in the UK reported a shortage of toilets in their area. A decline in the maintenance of public facilities over the years has left many, including older and disabled people and those with young children, having to plan carefully or being forced to rely on private businesses. It has also significantly affected gig economy workers and people sleeping rough.\n\nFour people explain the impact the reduction in public toilets has had on their wellbeing.\n\n\u2018Another thing that makes life with chronic illness harder\u2019\n\nAnnie, 72, who has multiple sclerosis (MS) and related bladder problems, said the availability of accessible public facilities had worsened over the years in her area. \u201cI used to know the location of pretty much every public toilet in Bolton town centre, but these are now fewer and not always easy to access,\u201d she said, explaining she has mobility problems.\n\nAnnie has an MS card, which gives her access to hospitality venues\u2019 facilities, and a Radar key to open locked public loos. \u201cThe M&S in the town centre, which was so handy, shut last year. It\u2019s been an issue since well before the pandemic,\u201d she said. Things may be changing, however, after Bolton council last year announced a \u00a3225,000 scheme to create more disabled toilets.\n\nProgressive MS and concerns about accessing facilities mean Annie has moved much of her social life online to Zoom. \u201cI plan fewer outings than I might otherwise do, and it limits where I can go. If I\u2019m not going to have access to a toilet, I try to be home within an hour. Sometimes this proves too long, leading to \u2018accidents\u2019 which can be embarrassing and uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nShe said she limits fluid intake if she has to go out for longer than an hour. \u201cThe lack of public toilets is just one more thing that makes life with a chronic illness harder than it needs to be.\u201d\n\n\u2018Children need the toilet very frequently\u2019\n\nView image in fullscreen John Zhang: \u2018You see more people just peeing in the streets now.\u2019 Photograph: Guardian Community\n\nFor those with young children, a lack of public toilets can make planning a day out unnecessarily complicated. John Zhang, 40, said his visits into the central London with his partner and five-year-old daughter had become less frequent due to this. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find toilets, unless we pay \u00a33.95 each for coffees or go to museums. I have to plan ahead where to take my child \u2013 children need to go to the toilet very frequently, they can\u2019t hold it. And sometimes in small cafes, there\u2019s not always a toilet [for customers]. It takes away the enjoyment of visiting.\u201d\n\nZhang, a tour operator, has noticed this decline over the past decade, and believes it negatively affects tourism. \u201cYou see more people just peeing in the streets now \u2013 it\u2019s not good for the city\u2019s economy and small businesses. Tourists complain that they can\u2019t find toilets. Sometimes, when there are public toilets, you have to use coins to pay \u2013 [but] not so many people carry cash and they often don\u2019t give change. It\u2019s not nice to see people peeing in the street, and if you gave them a choice they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u2018It is a source of anxiety going anywhere new\u2019\n\nA shortage of facilities means Bob, 70, can struggle with going to unfamiliar places. \u201cLike many men of my age, I have an enlarged prostate, meaning I need to urinate frequently and often at short notice. You need to have a constantly updated mental map of public toilets, which is possible for my local area but it is a source of anxiety going anywhere new.\u201d\n\nBob, who is retired in East Sussex, said it had been a problem for years, including in Norwich and London, where he previously lived. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough public toilets where I live \u2013 many have been closed in recent years and not replaced.\u201d\n\nHe sees the issue as part of a wider trend towards privatisation of public spaces and facilities. \u201cI am concerned that the trend to close public toilets and rely on access to commercial facilities will continue until the very idea of \u2018free\u2019 public services disappears.\u201d\n\n\u2018There is evidence of soiling in public areas\u2019\n\nOthers pointed to the degradation of the environment and their local area. Elspeth, a retired teacher in mid Wales, said she worried that local councils could close some toilets in the national parks where she enjoys spending time, with public health implications.\n\n\u201cThere are still some public toilets in Pembrokeshire and the Brecon Beacons. [In places] where there are no toilets there is evidence of soiling within car parks and nearby hedgerows, which is revolting and unsafe,\u201d Elspeth said. In Wales, the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 requires each local authority to produce a local toilet strategy.\n\nElspeth drew a comparison with New Zealand, following a visit there. \u201cI have been astounded by [their] quality and quantity of public toilets, even in the most remote locations. This investment in a public need has meant their countryside has remained pristine. Their toilets put us to shame.\u201d"}

There was no evidence of any vehicles being impeded, no evidence of any interference with emergency services, or any risk to life.\u201d\n\nRaj Chada, representing Thunberg, Kebbon and Unwin, had argued that his clients had not had the details of the section 14 order properly communicated to them by the arresting officers.\n\nIn each case, Chada said, \u201cIt is unclear as to what the condition was or what was communicated, and so what the defendants should know or didn\u2019t know; and so the prosecution case fails at this stage.\u201d\n\nGoing through the evidence of each arresting officer in turn, Chada argued that each had failed to properly communicate the details of the condition placed on the protest. In the case of Kebbon, the officer told him he was being arrested for section 14 \u201cobstruction\u201d; and in the cases of Unwin and Thunberg, officers gave incorrect details of the location to which the order redirected protesters.\n\n\u201cIn relation to Miss Thunberg, [the officer] was asked [while giving evidence] specifically about what the condition was, and he said Piccadilly Place,\u201d said Chada.\n\n\u201cDoes that exist?\u201d asked Laws.\n\n\u201cNot on the map we have,\u201d Chada replied. \u201cIt is not the condition. Whatever it is, it is not the condition.\n\n\u201cWe say for good measure that the condition that was in the charge is not the condition that was communicated to the officers\u2019 supervisors. But our primary submission relates to that which was communicated to each of the three that I represent, which does not meet what the charge says, simple as that.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the officer who arrested Thunberg told the court he did not take into account her media profile when giving her time to comply with a restriction placed on the protest she was attending.\n\nPC David Lawrence said he knew who the high-profile Swedish activist was when he approached her to instruct her to comply with the order.\n\nLawrence said he had been called to the protest and asked to enforce the section 14 order that had been made by the senior officer at the scene. \u201cWe moved into the crowd and started telling people to move their protest on to the pavement,\u201d he told the court.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a few people initially, and then we approached a group in the centre of the crowd. I initially spoke to a female and she left; after that I spoke with Thunberg. I asked what her intentions were and asked if she wished to remain and she would be arrested, and if she wanted to leave and continue her protest on the pavement.\n\n\u201cShe replied in words, by saying: \u2018I\u2019m staying.\u2019 I then informed her that she would be arrested and removed from the area.\u201d\n\nLaws said he arrested Thunberg because \u201cshe was breaching a section 14 public order notice\u201d.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Chada, Lawrence admitted he did not know the precise location to which protesters were being asked to relocate.\n\nAfter Lawrence indicated that he knew who Thunberg was, Chada asked him: \u201cDid you take into account the photographers and the ease with which she can move?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had officers moving them [the photographers] out of the way,\u201d Lawrence replied, adding that another woman he had asked to move had been able to leave without difficulty.\n\nPointing out that that individual did not have the same public profile as Thunberg, Chada asked Lawrence: \u201cDid you give any account to that to allow her more opportunity to move, any further time?\u201d\n\n\u201cAny further time? No,\u201d Lawrence replied.\n\nLaws said he would grant Chada\u2019s request for the government to pay his legal fees and Thunberg\u2019s travel costs."}

Bustling excitedly on to the stage, the Detroit Youth Choir belted out a soaring, energetic rendition of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis\u2019s song Can\u2019t Hold Us. The performance was so powerful that the TV show\u2019s host, Terry Crews, walked on to the stage and announced tearfully: \u201cEvery young man and woman on this stage represents me and where I came from\u201d \u2013 before taking the unprecedented step of overriding the judges and pressing the golden buzzer himself, automatically sending the choir to the quarter finals. It was an unforgettable moment of television; and the new Disney+ series Choir follows what happened next.\n\nWatch the DYC audition on America\u2019s Got Talent in 2019.\n\nIf you watched America\u2019s Got Talent or have a decent grasp of golden-buzzer etiquette, Choir probably went to the top of your must-watch list as soon as it was announced. If not, Choir is basically the story of some kids who came second in a talent show five years ago because a man in a pink suit punched a golden piece of plastic. It\u2019s a tougher sell, in other words.\n\nYet even if you come to it stripped of all context, as I did, Choir has an awful lot going for it. What we have is fundamentally Last Chance U for theatre kids, and it\u2019s as moving and gripping as you might expect.\n\nView image in fullscreen Choir members in rehearsal. Photograph: Disney\n\nThe Detroit Youth Choir is a non-profit organisation that offers a world-class performing arts experience to inner-city children who might otherwise stray into trouble. It exists to mould and shape ambitious, mainly Black kids, giving them the confidence to break out of their preordained path in life. However, life in the Detroit Youth Choir is no cakewalk. Competition is fierce and the people who run the programme demand perfection, especially as they hunt for the next big thing after America\u2019s Got Talent. The choir can make you, but can just as easily break you.\n\nView image in fullscreen Artistic director Anthony White and young singers. Photograph: Disney\n\nLeading the school is artistic director Anthony White, who has been in charge for more than 20 years. He is an interesting figure, constantly vacillating between inspiration and exasperation. He is sometimes hard on the kids \u2013 in one audition he reduces child after child to tears \u2013 but you sense that this is only because he is desperately trying to lift them beyond the level they have set for themselves. As Crews said through his tears, if just one person can believe in children like this, they can be capable of anything. This is why White is chasing the post-AGT high; he wants these young people to know what they can achieve.\n\nSomeone more cynical than me might argue, though, that the whole thing reeks of false jeopardy. White spends the entire series focused on getting the Detroit Youth Choir back into the national conversation through a performance at Carnegie Hall in New York. which seems a little redundant when you take a step back and realise that he\u2019s doing it through the prism of a six-part documentary that has been distributed through an entertainment conglomerate\u2019s streaming platform to an audience of 150 million people.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to What's On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The best examples of this genre (Last Chance U and Cheer) tend to be a little more unflinching in their examination of their subjects. They didn\u2019t shy away from showing us how close the kids come to wrecking everything by giving over to their worst impulses. They also lingered on the uglier aspects of the adults in charge, and the fine line that exists between demanding perfection and bullying. While Choir does touch on this \u2013 at one point White offers a weak \u201cI\u2019m hard on these kids, but the streets will be harder\u201d justification \u2013 it also seems willing to turn a blind eye, in favour of giving us a full-bore shot of uncomplicated aspiration.\n\nBut I\u2019ll be damned if it doesn\u2019t get you anyway. As with all the other shows of this genre, there is a point towards the end of Choir where you see just how hard these kids are willing to work to achieve their dreams. At that point you would have to be a monster to not end up a blubbering wreck.\n\nThe Choir is available on Disney+"}

For the first time, it is believed, US troops were killed from the air by an enemy drone: three US army reservists died and more than 80 were wounded in last weekend\u2019s attack on Tower 22, a little-known logistics base near Jordan\u2019s border with Syria.\n\nThe attack, the Pentagon said, had \u201cthe footprints of Kataib Hezbollah\u201d, an Iran-aligned militia in Iraq. Joe Biden, the US president, added that he held Tehran responsible \u201cin the sense that they\u2019re supplying the weapons\u201d \u2013 the fast proliferating, relatively cheap drones that are changing the nature of warfare.\n\n\u201cImagine it was the 1990s,\u201d said Fabian Hinz, a Middle East weapons expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cWhat militia groups like Kataib Hezbollah could have done is target a US base with a few rockets. Now they can do lots more damage with a greater reach: even the smallest drones can have very long ranges and they can be very precise.\u201d\n\nThe exact model of the drone that smashed in the middle of the night into a living quarters at Tower 22 is not known, though US officials have briefed it was \u201ca type of Shahed drone\u201d. If that is correct, it is most likely to the smaller Shahed 101 or delta winged Shahed 131, both believed to be in Kataib Hezbollah\u2019s arsenal, Hinz said, with estimated ranges of at least 700km (434 miles) and a cost of $20,000 (\u00a315,700) or more.\n\nThe drones\u2019 designer and likely manufacturer is Shahed Aviation Industries Research Center, an Iranian company subordinate to the country\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, according to the US. Its manufacturing efforts have taken off over the past five years, fuelled by a series of conflicts and Iran\u2019s foreign policy ambitions, stemming from a history of necessity supported by sophisticated innovation.\n\nIran has a long history of testing and deploying drones, dating back to the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, an effort driven partly by the country\u2019s lack of access to high end western technology that would enable it to purchase, develop and maintain a sophisticated air force. But in September 2019, an extraordinary drone and missile attack on two Saudi oil installations at Abqaiq and Khurais, which temporarily knocked out 5% of the world\u2019s oil supply, suggested a different leap forward.\n\nAt the time, Saudi Arabia was embroiled in Yemen\u2019s civil war, fighting against Houthi rebels, who are allied to Iran. Although the attack was claimed by the Houthis, the Saudis said the drones, of a then unknown delta wing type, came from the north, not from Yemen to the south, and blamed Iran. Though not yet named, those drones have been subsequently identified as Shahed 131s.\n\nThe unknown delta wing drone reappeared in July 2021, in an attack on an Israeli owned oil tanker, Mercer Street, in which a Briton and a Romanian were killed. Dominic Raab, then the foreign secretary, said Iran was probably responsible. The existence of the new drone was not formally acknowledged by Iran until December, with Iran developing a scaled up Shahed-136 alongside the 131.\n\nA few months later, Russia invaded Ukraine, and after its initial effort at conquest failed, it began searching for new weapons. Iran was one of the few countries, along with North Korea, willing to sell Moscow weapons. It agreed to supply Shahed 136s, first seen on the battlefield in autumn 2022. A Ukrainian commander said a Shahed destroyed an M777 howitzer during the Kharkiv counteroffensive: \u201cInstead of firing 100 artillery shells, it\u2019s easier to release one of these drones.\u201d\n\nWithin a few weeks, Shahed drones were widespread in Ukraine, distinctive not just from their shape but their noisy engine, sounding somewhere between a lawn mower and a moped. An attack on central Kyiv on 17 October that year made them headline news: four people were killed in a terrifying attack as Shaheds swirled over the city centre, a handful eluding desperate attempts to shoot them down by firing from the ground.\n\nShahed 136 drones have a light carbon fibre airframe and range of more than 1,500 miles, enabling Russia to fly them from Belarus in the north and occupied areas in the south to target Ukraine\u2019s cities. They can carry 20-40kg of explosives, around double the 131 and enough to \u201cblow in a pretty big hole in a non hardened structure\u201d according to Justin Bronk, an aviation analyst at the Royal United Services Institute.\n\nThe drones, Bronk adds, are best considered cheap substitutes for guided cruise missiles, most effective against soft or \u201cstatic structures\u201d which force those under threat to \u201ceither invest money in defences or disperse and relocate which renders things like aircraft on bases more inefficient\u201d. Flight paths are normally pre-programmed and can be quite complex, and Shaheds often use a sophisticated combination of US, Russian and Chinese navigation systems to make them harder to jam, according to Bronk.\n\nShahed drone attacks in Ukraine continue. In November a record 75 targeted Kyiv, although their growing familiarity and slow speed has made them easier to neutralise: 71 were shot down, Ukrainian officials said. But evolution of the technology continues. Iran developed a faster jet engine powered Shahed 238 last November, able to fly at well over twice the speed of the 136, and which is believed to have been fired into Ukraine last month.\n\nThe technology also suits Tehran: Shahed drones can be easily supplied to Iran\u2019s regional allies, the Houthis or the self-styled resistance militias in Iraq or Syria, in whole or in components. Though Russia has used them overtly, drones can be used deniably, as at Abqaiq or most recently in the Tower 22 attack, where even the US has taken its time to firmly attribute responsibility.\n\nIn Yemen, they are reassembled and the designs sometimes refined, and since 7 October they have been used repeatedly by the Houthis in their attacks on western shipping in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, and even to target western warships directly. So far the Houthi attacks on warships have all failed, but the most significant attack on 9 January demonstrated an asymmetric effect.\n\nSeven out of 18 Houthi drones were shot down by Britain\u2019s HMS Diamond using a mixture of cheaper gun fire and Sea Viper or Aster missiles which cost \u00a31m to \u00a32m each. It is a simple illustration of how the drones impose costs on defenders fending off the new class of weapons. Similar calculations apply in Ukraine and elsewhere, but often the reality is that the human or economic cost of a drone attack succeeding, as happened at the weekend, is higher.\n\n\u201cWhat Iran is demonstrating is that a relatively robust capability need not be very advanced and virtually any military force can afford any number of drones,\u201d said Samuel Bendett, a drone specialist at the US Center for Naval Analyses, suggesting it is likely that the technology will only spread further. \u201cRather than investing in more expensive combat capabilities, this shows it is cheaper to buy a drone and hope it either hits something or your enemy expends resources shooting it down.\u201d"}

He was convicted of sexual assault and exposure in 2018 and sentenced to two consecutive suspended jail terms of less than 12 months.\n\nIt is understood his asylum claims were twice rejected by the Home Office before he successfully lodged an appeal at a tribunal and was awarded refugee status in 2021 or 2022. Ezedi was permitted to stay in the country after he converted to Christianity.\n\nThere is a lot that is not know about Ezedi\u2019s case, for example: the details of his offences, the sentencing judge\u2019s decision making, the grounds on which Ezedi launched his appeal, the grounds on which a judge ultimately granted refugee status.\n\nHere we take a look at the asylum process.\n\nWhat is asylum?\n\nAsylum is an application made to obtain refugee status in the UK. To be eligible, a person must have left their country of origin or residence and be unable to go back because they fear persecution. This could include persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or political opinion. It includes anything that puts a person at risk because of the social, religious or political situation in their country.\n\nHow and where can someone claim asylum?\n\nSome people claim asylum immediately on entering the UK, at the airport, ferry port, train station, or when they reach the UK from the sea. They do this by telling an immigration official they wish to claim asylum.\n\nAlternatively, they may contact the Home Office to make an appointment to claim for asylum.\n\nWhat is the process?\n\nAsylum seekers will have an initial interview, which is called the \u201cscreening interview\u201d, where basic information is taken. This includes questions about their journey to the UK and why they are claiming asylum.\n\nSome time after the screening interview, the applicant will have their \u201csubstantive interview\u201d. This is an in-depth interview where the asylum seeker explains why they would be at risk if they returned to their country.\n\nIs it possible to appeal against a refused application?\n\nIf an asylum claim is refused, the applicant has the right to appeal in the courts. The first step is to take the appeal to the first-tier tribunal immigration and asylum chamber. Led by a judge, this tribunal handles appeals for some decisions made by the Home Office relating to permission to stay, deportation from and entry clearance to the UK.\n\nIf this appeal is lost, the asylum seeker may be able to appeal to the upper tribunal immigration and asylum chamber.\n\nWhat are the grounds for refusal?\n\nAn application can be refused for a variety of reasons, determined on a case-by-case basis, including the credibility of the claim, immigration issues, nationality or age disputes.\n\nThere are some grounds for mandatory and discretionary refusals related to criminality. A claim must be refused if the person has been convicted of a criminal offence in the UK or overseas for which they have received a jail sentence of 12 months or more, is a persistent offender, or has committed a criminal offence which caused serious harm.\n\nSerious harm is defined as \u201can offence that has caused serious physical or psychological harm to a victim or victims, or that has contributed to a widespread problem that causes serious harm to a community or to society in general\u201d.\n\nSexual offences are highlighted in this section of the guidance and if a person is on the sex offender register then their application will be refused on the grounds of serious harm.\n\nAs well as the mandatory refusals, the home secretary can refuse an application when a person has been convicted of a criminal offence in the UK or overseas for which they have received a custodial sentence of less than 12 months.\n\nAre there are any exemptions to mandatory refusal rules?\n\nIf a person should be refused on mandatory or discretionary grounds, it is possible this would be overturned at appeal on human rights grounds for violating the European convention on human rights, the refugee convention or on compassionate grounds.\n\nOfficial guidance also states that \u201cany very compelling factors that amount to an exceptional reason why the application should be granted\u201d can be considered.\n\nCan a person apply for refugee status on the grounds of their religious beliefs?\n\nAn asylum seeker can argue that in their home country they would be persecuted as a result of their religious beliefs or conversion."}

She adds that there was no light pollution. Everyone, from her children to her grandchildren, enjoyed the water.\n\nClark is a proponent of multigenerational holidays, where different generations of one family go away together. In a poll of 2,000 British adults, more than half of those surveyed (56%) said they regretted not spending more time with grandparents and 54% said they hoped to bring them on future holidays.\n\nEasyJet\u2019s holiday wing is now offering \u201cgrans go free\u201d places on trips to Europe, after research found half of UK families had never holidayed abroad with their grandparents.\n\nClark says that these holidays can be illuminating. She went to Cornwall with her three children, their partners and her three grandchildren for her birthday and learned a lot about her relatives.\n\n\u201cWe got to spend more time with my daughter\u2019s girlfriend. When they met, they lived in Amsterdam, and we had never spent a whole week with her. It was so lovely,\u201d Clark says.\n\n\u201cBeing with her was revealing. We learned more about our children\u2019s partners\u2019 politics, the books they had read and their feelings about climate change and the world. We had lively discussions and also boring nights where we sat and chilled out with wine and the TV. We watched some great films. I never realised what a massive fan of Harry Potter my daughter\u2019s partner was.\u201d\n\nClark and her family rented out a big house with four bathrooms, one big lounge and a large dining room. \u201cWe could spread out as well \u2026 it was a treat as it was for my 60th birthday,\u201d she says.\n\nOne downside, Clark says, however, is the cost. They had to travel in school holidays because of the children, which is much more expensive, so saving up for another big family trip will take time.\n\nTo keep harmony, Clark suggests ensuring each guest has their own bathroom. \u201cWe also ate together every day and then planned what we would do the following day during dinner. I recommend daily communal eating,\u201d she says, adding that each couple cooked for everyone one night of the week.\n\nView image in fullscreen Perrin Debock, right, enjoying Egypt with her mother and mother\u2019s partner\n\nAnnalisa Barbieri, who offers relationship advice in her Guardian column, says her main advice on multigenerational holidays is \u201cdon\u2019t go unless you\u2019re sure\u201d. She adds: \u201cThere\u2019s also nothing like finding out about family when you go on holiday, because seeing someone over a 24-hour period is very illuminating.\n\n\u201cIf you tend to be the responsible one, then the chances are you will end up organising everything as people look to you. If you are the only one who speaks a foreign language you will be the de facto translator (this happens to me). Ditto if you are the only driver or the one who doesn\u2019t drink \u2013 you will end up doing the driving after meals out.\u201d\n\nBarbieri suggests thinking about what you want to achieve on holiday. \u201cAre some of you late risers? If so, then maybe you need to split the groups so that some of you go out early. I am an early riser and it drives me nuts waiting for everyone to get ready and by the time we get out, everything is super busy.\u201d\n\nShe adds that she \u201cwould always suggest a separate space if possible so you can retreat to your own space\u201d. This includes staying in a hotel \u201cso that someone else is \u2018in charge\u2019 \u2013 someone else decides when breakfast for example, ie the hotel does! Or adjoining villas or Airbnbs.\u201d She says sharing one big space can lead to tensions. \u201cOne person inevitably does the cooking or cleaning if that hasn\u2019t been decided. So set boundaries early.\u201d\n\nPerrin Debock, 52, from Paris, said her parents divorced when she was two. For almost a decade she has taken a big trip with either her mother and her partner, or her father and his wife. She says: \u201cFor me, my daughter, now 15 years old, and my husband, these holidays \u2018en famille\u2019 are special because we bond and share the everyday little surprises of travelling.\u201d\n\nLast Christmas they went to Egypt for 10 days with her mother\u2019s side. Their next planned holiday will be to Mexico with the other side of the family. \u201cMy daughter is growing up. It is a precious time to share things and moments with her. I know my parents treasure those. Of course, after a week or 10 days, we are happy to each go back home and not hear about them for some time, but those shared transgenerational holidays are great moments to learn from each other. It is a lot of money and planning to please everyone, of course, but definitely worth it.\n\nShe adds: \u201cThe preparation before, and the pictures after, offer tons of opportunity to bond over things. I know my daughter will always remember those shared holidays. When my parents disappear, I will have no regrets of not sharing enough with them.\u201d"}

The prices will apply to vehicles weighing more than 1.6 tonnes with a combustion engine or hybrid vehicles, and more than 2 tonnes for electric vehicles. The move will not apply to Paris residents\u2019 parking.\n\nEarlier this year, Paris held a similar vote on whether to ban rented electric scooters and subsequently became the first European capital to ban them. Turnout for that vote was 103,000 people \u2013 about 7% of registered voters in Paris \u2013 with 89% approving a ban. Environmental campaigners are hoping for a higher turn-out for the vote on SUVs.\n\nAn Opinionway poll for Le Parisien this month found that 61% of Paris residents backed raising parking charges for SUVs. Motorist groups and rightwing opposition parties have criticised the proposals.\n\nHidalgo said a citizens\u2019 vote was important because French democracy was \u201cin crisis\u201d. She said the new parking tariffs would reduce the presence of SUVs. \u201cThis measure would have a dissuasive effect because these large cars are taking up more and more space \u2026 We saw with the end of rental scooters that the sense of peace was visible. As soon as the rental scooters disappeared last year, there was a feeling of liberation and calm. We expect that [with SUVs].\u201d\n\nOutside the Paris primary school, Tony Renucci, director of the air quality campaign group, Respire, said: \u201cParis has a chance to send a strong message to car manufacturers: stop building SUVs.\u201d He said it was about changing the narrative of ubiquitous advertising for big cars. In 2021, a study for the World Wildlife Fund in France found that in 2019, adverts for SUVs accounted for 3 hours and 50 minutes of television time in France each day.\n\nLucie, 39, a caterer dropping her nine-year-old to school, said: \u201cI get so angry seeing people sitting alone in their big SUVs in traffic in the morning; it just doesn\u2019t make sense. We live in an era of massive contradictions: there is a climate crisis yet manufacturers are making these giant cars. My son finds the disproportionate size of these SUVs quite shocking. The other day one was trying to park in a narrow sidestreet and was half crushing all the bikes parked behind. At my firm, we do deliveries daily and choose do it all by bike, but I know not everyone can do that.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

It is possible to live in a city centre without a car if public transport is improved.\u201d\n\nPauline, 37, who works in publishing and has three children, said: \u201cLike a lot of Parisians, I don\u2019t even have a driving licence. Ultimately, for the sake of my children, I want a city without any cars at all. We all want Paris to be greener \u2013 less pollution, less noise. SUVs are disgusting.

I\u2019ve always worked remotely so have been flexible around my husband\u2019s career. We left the last place after less than a year, because he was made redundant shortly after starting his job. I loved it there and made some great friends, but we left in a rush. I hoped we\u2019d stay permanently in the place we moved to next, but I\u2019ve felt miserable living here and made it my mission to move back to our previous place.\n\nNow, after five years \u2013 the longest we have lived anywhere \u2013 we have an opportunity to move back. Initially I was excited, but now I am looking around \u2013 the kids are happily settled in school and I\u2019ve made local friends \u2013 and wondering whether this place might be good enough after all. Or should I take one last leap of faith?\n\nI\u2019m worried that perhaps I\u2019m repeating a pattern by leaving again, but equally, I worry that it\u2019s foolish not to move back to the place I love.\n\nYou titled your letter \u201cAm I repeating a pattern by leaving again?\u201d and it\u2019s interesting you\u2019ve seen there is one. Patterns can be useful pathfinders, or they can be grooves we get stuck in and don\u2019t have the knowledge or confidence to get out of. There were a few unknowns and you didn\u2019t mention any actual places, thus I don\u2019t know if the place you\u2019re in now offers more long-term possibilities than the last one, or how permanent either of those places is.\n\nI contacted UKCP psychotherapist Mark Vahrmeyer, no stranger to moving around a lot himself in a previous life (we did a podcast on belonging which you may find interesting). What struck us is how you hoped where you live now would become permanent but then you disliked it so much you made it your \u201cmission to leave\u201d but now having a chance to leave, you\u2019re not sure.\n\nVahrmeyer picked up on how leaving the place you were before, in such a rush, must have been a shock for you. \u201cAlso,\u201d said Vahrmeyer, \u201cI didn\u2019t get much of a sense of your desire, your appetite, what you wanted. Perhaps following your husband\u2019s career provided the excitement, the purveyor of all the adventure?\u201d\n\nBeing good enough is rather undervalued as a benchmark in the search for the perfect\n\nWas the place you\u2019re in now where you had children, or did you have them before the move? I wonder if either having children, or them getting older and perhaps their needs becoming more obvious, has given you a chance to re-evaluate what\u2019s important to you all as a family. You mention this place being \u201cgood enough\u201d. Being good enough is rather undervalued as a benchmark in the search for the perfect. That said, no one should remain unhappy if they have a chance to change it.\n\n\u201cYou say your children are settled,\u201d said Vahrmeyer \u201cand that\u2019s a really good thing, children need stability. Perhaps that\u2019s something to think about alongside what you and your husband want. Maybe you\u2019ve changed and you\u2019re settled [more than you realise?].\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder if the last place,\u201d suggested Vahrmeyer, has become slightly idealised? You were there for such a short time. Was life in general more exciting then?\u201d Are you able to go back to the place you were for a visit, to see how you feel in reality and not fantasy?\n\nNowhere is perfect but it\u2019s about \u201cbeing able to accept disappointment and limitations but still find substance in a place or a person,\u201d said Vahrmeyer. He also wanted you to think about if it\u2019s the \u201cplace that\u2019s making you miserable or the permanence? Is it where you\u2019re living now you find miserable or is it something around the idea of putting down roots?\u201d\n\nI also want you to practise an exercise I tried myself over Christmas. I was feeling a little overwhelmed by life, and looked back at my bachelor girl flat with some sentiment. So I really imagined myself there, but as I am now. I went through all the things I like to do now and imagined myself doing them back there. And I realised that neither my parents nor my friends would be round the corner any longer. So much has changed, internally for me, and externally in the place. I saw that what I had now was not only really appealing but I realised I\u2019d made my life the way it was on purpose. I wonder if you could do such an exercise? This may help you really zone in on what actually matters to you now.\n\nEvery week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

They spoke of a young, lonely, anxious girl who had faced many challenges, their trauma at her loss and the horrific nature of her death.\n\nA series of statements, extracts of which are reproduced here, was read to the court as the two were being sentenced.\n\nEsther Ghey, Brianna\u2019s mother\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Brianna wasn\u2019t a fighter and she must have been terrified,\u2019 said Esther Ghey. Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA\n\nBrianna was \u201can extremely vulnerable teenager\u201d, her mother, Esther, said. She was \u201cso happy\u201d Brianna had found a friend in Jenkinson and pleased she was going to meet her that Saturday. \u201cI thought that she would have a wonderful time, hanging around with her friend and getting some fresh air when all that time she was being lured to her death. All I can think about is that she would have been scared and I wasn\u2019t there for her. She needed me to protect her, Brianna wasn\u2019t a fighter and she must have been so terrified.\u201d\n\nShe spoke of the silence now in the family home, of going into Brianna\u2019s bedroom \u201cto ask her where she had gone and if she was OK. It broke my heart to know that I would never get a response.\u201d\n\nGood memories hurt because Brianna was not there to remember them with. The final memories, she said, \u201care the memories of hearing the news that my child had been found dead; memories of identifying Brianna\u2019s lifeless body; memories of her funeral; and now to add to that, memories of the trial where the two people responsible for Brianna\u2019s death have cowardly pointed the finger towards each other, showing no remorse and only interested in defending themselves.\u201d\n\nOf Brianna\u2019s killers, she said: \u201cI have moments where I feel sorry for them because they have also ruined their own lives, but I have to remember that they felt no empathy for Brianna when they left her bleeding to death after their premeditated and vicious attack, which was carried out not because Brianna had done anything wrong, but just because one hated trans people and the other thought it would be fun.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that someone who is so disturbed and obsessed with murder and torture would ever be able to be rehabilitated.\u201d\n\nAlisha Ghey, Brianna\u2019s sister\n\nThe loss of her younger sibling was \u201cso horrific\u201d, \u201cindescribably painful\u201d and \u201clike a part of me is missing\u201d, Alisha Ghey said.\n\nLearning of the \u201ctrauma my sister was put through\u201d had heightened her anxieties. She would spend time away from home \u201cto get away from this sadness and anger and when I\u2019d come back so would these dark feelings. I never felt alone with Brianna in the house. I would tell her everything and she would listen, not having that makes me feel more alone than ever.\n\n\u201cI now feel anxious. I struggle to trust new people that I meet because it was Brianna\u2019s friend who she trusted that took her life. I worry that the same thing might happen to me, my friends or family.\n\n\u201cI have attended counselling sessions but felt that no one could understand the pain that I am going through, and no one can ever make me feel better. The only thing that would make me happy again would be if I could hear Brianna\u2019s voice and laughter, and cuddle up on my bed watching a film together like we used to do. But I will never get my sister back and I must carry that pain for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nPolice release footage of teenagers being arrested for murder of Brianna Ghey \u2013 video report\n\nWes Powell, Brianna\u2019s stepfather\n\nThe memories of identifying Brianna\u2019s lifeless body and carrying her coffin during her funeral had been \u201cburnt\u201d into his mind \u201cand will haunt me for as long as I live\u201d, said her stepfather, Wes Powell.\n\n\u201cThe thought of Brianna laying face down in the dirt, terrified, in severe pain, covered in blood and all alone without her family for comfort, breaks my heart and fills me with sorrow.\u201d She was \u201cso full of life and now our home feels empty and silent without her\u201d.\n\n\u201cI often sit in Brianna\u2019s room alone trying to picture what her room used to look like. I imagine her lying on her bed, texting her friends and watching TV like she always did. I try to remember what her laughter and voice sounded like, which could often be heard coming from her room. But now when I look I see only an urn where Brianna should be.\u201d\n\nHe said Brianna\u2019s mother was no longer able to continue with the \u201cdream career\u201d she worked so hard for. Brianna\u2019s sister, who wanted to go to university, had seen this opportunity \u201csnatched away from her due to this trauma\u201d. He had attended mental health sessions to try to cope with his guilt at \u201cfailing to protect my family\u201d.\n\n\u201cBrianna had a large online following but in reality she was lonely, vulnerable and in need of a close friend. Both Eddie and Scarlett knew this and preyed upon her vulnerabilities acting as two predators stalking their prey.\u201d\n\nRatcliffe and Jenkinson\u2019s \u201crefusal of guilt\u201d and \u201clack of remorse\u201d had caused further \u201ctorment\u201d. \u201cBrianna did not lose her life, it was stolen from her. I do not believe that society is a better or safer place with Scarlett or Eddie in it.\u201d\n\nPeter Spooner, Brianna\u2019s father\n\nView image in fullscreen Peter Spooner said he had been \u2018proud to gain another beautiful daughter\u2019. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nAt first, he said, being the father of a transgender child \u201cwas a difficult thing\u201d. But though he grieved the son he had lost, \u201cI was proud to gain another beautiful daughter\u201d.\n\n\u201cHer appearance changed as she blossomed into a lovely young girl, her eyes were the same, she had my eyes when I looked at her. We were forming a new relationship and these two murderers have stolen that from us both.\n\n\u201cI hate how Brianna\u2019s life has been brutally taken away from her and she has been deprived of the life she wanted to live. She never had the chance to sit her exams or go on to further education.\n\n\u201cNow my world has been torn apart, justice may have been done with the guilty verdicts, but no amount of time spent in prison will be enough for these monsters. I cannot call them children as that makes them sound naive or vulnerable, which they are not. They are pure evil. Brianna was the vulnerable one.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t standing here reading this statement today, but if I wasn\u2019t then there would have been another father stood here in my shoes, another child from their list would have been brutally murdered and I wouldn\u2019t wish this terror and pain on another person.\u201d"}

Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA\n\nPassing sentence at Chester crown court on Friday, Judge Michael Leeming said: \u201cPrison may be hard for you, Alice Wood, but you only have yourself to blame for the situation you now find yourself in.\u201d\n\nThe three-week trial heard the couple had spent the evening at a party in Stoke-on-Trent with staff and service users of the brain injury charity Headway, where Watson was a support worker.\n\nSpeaking through tears for much of her evidence, Wood told the court that while they were driving home, Watson had \u201cflipped\u201d and accused her of flirting with other men, and the argument continued when they arrived at the house they shared.\n\nShe said she had left the house and got into her car to drive away, but Watson had followed her.\n\nThe prosecution said Wood, who had recently been awarded a scholarship for a master\u2019s at Cambridge, \u201cused her car as a weapon\u201d, with CCTV showing she veered off the road and hit Watson twice. The first time he was hit, Watson fell on to the bonnet of the Ford Fiesta before stumbling to his feet as he was hit again.\n\nHe became trapped underneath the car as Wood drove 158 metres up the road before stopping, and knocking on the door of a nearby house where she said: \u201cPlease phone an ambulance. I think I\u2019ve run over my boyfriend.\u201d\n\nWood was preparing for final exams in theology, philosophy and ethics at Manchester University at the time of the murder and on the first day of the trial she had a copy of the book Meditations, a philosophy text by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, under her arm.\n\nIn a statement, Watson\u2019s family said: \u201cThe one person Ryan trusted the most is the person who took his life in such a violent way. Alice is in prison where she belongs but no sentence is going to be long enough for what she has taken from us and Ryan. He will never get to live his life and fulfil his dreams.\u201d"}

However, the fleece has recently had a haute upgrade. Last month, the actor Florence Pugh was pictured in a cream coloured zip-up fleece during the couture shows in Paris.\n\nPugh\u2019s jacket had all the hallmarks of a traditional fleece \u2013 fuzzy faux shearling and pockets deep enough for a roll of poo bags \u2013 but the gold-tone zipper and exaggerated collar hinted that the fleece wasn\u2019t made for taking the bins out. In fact, it is from the LVMH-owned French brand Patou and costs \u00a3890.\n\nRecently, A-listers of all ages have begun to appropriate the outdoor staple. Gen Z models such as Kaia Gerber and Gigi Hadid wear them on trips to Erewhon, a cult, fancy LA grocery store, while on Instagram Gwyneth Paltrow has been modelling one from Goop, her own fashion line. At recent catwalk shows, including Chlo\u00e9, Dior and Fendi, models were bundled up in cosy fleeces, while prices on the designer e-tailer site Net-a-Porter reach \u00a35,500 for a hooded fleece from the Italian luxury brand Brunello Cucinelli.\n\nThe once humble fleece is now not so humble and on the high street the frenzy is equally in full swing. A spokesperson for John Lewis says online searches for fleeces have jumped eightfold year-on-year. Marks & Spencer\u2019s latest GoodMove activewear range included a \u201ctrail\u201d collection featuring several fleeces. Since launching in January it has sold more than 3,000 of the \u00a345 fleeces.\n\nBut it is the \u201cdad fleeces\u201d from outdoor specialists such as Mountain Warehouse, Craghoppers and Berghaus that have suddenly become coveted among millennials and gen Z. Often found in the back of the car covered in dog hair, nowadays they are being worn to natty wine bars. Regatta, a British outdoors chain known for its no-frills fleeces, reports double-digit growth in the category. Free from flashy logos and sold in limited muted colours such as mossy greens and oatmeal, these fleeces are different from more \u201cgorpcore\u201d styles, which feature technical fabrics and utilitarian toggles.\n\nJessica Slinn, Regatta\u2019s women\u2019s lifestyle category manager, describes the fleece category as \u201cever evolving\u201d. \u201cThe perception of a fleece has changed,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat was once an outdoor commodity has now become so much more. Anyone can wear a fleece and with such a wide range of designs from shape, colour, print and fabrics there\u2019s something for everyone.\u201d\n\nBut for all of the fleece\u2019s associations with nature they are often made from polyester, a kind of plastic, usually derived from petroleum. There are brands such as Passenger and Patagonia that opt for recycled polyester. Experts also suggest using a Guppyfriend bag when washing fleeces to reduce the amount of microplastics released.\n\nThe great fleece upswing can be pegged to a wider outdoorsy trend that fashion brands have been quick to reorient themselves towards. Hiking and camping gear is now just as likely to be found on the front row as at the foot of a mountain.\n\nFor his debut show as creative director of Burberry last season, the Yorkshire-born designer Daniel Lee even set up camp. Inside a giant canopy guests sipped hot toddies as models in hiking boots weaved their way around them. Now it\u2019s pitching up at Harrods.\n\nTo mark the department store\u2019s 175th anniversary, Burberry is taking over the Knightsbridge store for February, transforming it into a luxury campground. Its windows have been draped in waterproof fabrics and ropes, while a \u201ccamping corner\u201d features a \u201cknight blue\u201d checked tent (a motif introduced by Lee) selling Burberry hot-water bottles and slabs of Romney\u2019s Kendal mint cake.\n\nMeanwhile, in Chelsea, Anya Hindmarch has teamed up with Ordnance Survey on a pop-up shop. In addition to backpacks there are navigational tools from the geospatial experts, alongside piles of carabiner clips and tins of plasters.\n\nJoel Moore, one of the founders of Common Ground, an outdoors group that organises hikes around the UK, sees fashion\u2019s co-opting of fleece as mainly positive. \u201cIf it gets more people into the outdoors and enjoying all the activities that come with it then it\u2019s good,\u201d Moore says.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t \u201csee the clothing as a trend. It might be fashionable now but I think the clothing and accessories will always have a place and a purpose in people\u2019s wardrobes. Especially in England.\u201d\n\nHot picks\n\nPrinted fleece, \u00a345, M&S\n\nMyla zip-through fleece, \u00a3158, Varley\n\nHot-water bottle, \u00a3290, Burberry for Harrods\n\nHalf-zip fleece, \u00a315.55, Regatta\n\nBlue fleece jacket, \u00a370, Berghaus\n\nRetro fleece, \u00a3210, Patagonia"}

Our clients take some small comfort in the fact that the Metropolitan police and Solicitors Regulation Authority have followed the hearings closely.\u201d\n\nAbout 80% of the victims of the Post Office and Fujitsu were yet to come forward, the inquiry heard.\n\nStein said those convicted, made bankrupt or forced to refund the Post Office for paper shortfalls should claim compensation. \u201cWe suggest that there is nothing to fear any more from the Post Office,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been discredited, they cannot hurt you any more.\u201d\n\nTim Moloney KC, representing 76 post office operators wrongly convicted on the basis of Horizon records, said the inquiry must ask whether those responsible at the Post Office and Fujitsu and in government \u201cdid not, could not or would not hear any warning that Horizon lacked integrity because their ears were stuffed with cash\u201d.\n\nPost Office investigators had financial and career incentives to push through successful prosecutions, the inquiry has heard, while Fujitsu was said to be looking to defend its government contracts. The Post Office is also believed to have financially benefited from falsely \u201crecovering\u201d funds from post office operators where in reality there had been no shortfall.\n\nMaloney said that despite the obvious injustice, \u201cproposals for an independent external review in March 2010 was shut down following contact between several senior managers including the head of criminal law, the head of security and head of product and practicality\u201d.\n\nHe called for the witness statements heard at the inquiry to be the start of a \u201crigorous criminal investigation\u201d and for compensation to be paid swiftly to those whose lives had been ruined. \u201cTragically, postmasters continue to die before any offer of proper, full and final compensation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe inquiry will resume in spring with evidence from the former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells and the current Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, who was postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012."}

For example, there was confusion about whether a GP was available onboard every day or for one day a week. Organisations working with the men told the delegation the barge felt like a prison.\n\nIn their letter to ministers, the group wrote: \u201cWe were disheartened to see some of the living conditions on the Bibby Stockholm, with many individuals having to share small, cramped cabins [originally designed for one person], often with people [up to six] they do not know [some of whom spoke a different language to them].\n\n\u201cThese crowded conditions were clearly contributing to a decline in mental health for some of the residents, and they could amount to violations of the human rights of asylum seekers.\u201d\n\nDiana Johnson, the chair of the home affairs committee, said: \u201cBeyond the question of whether housing asylum seekers on a barge instead of hotels is actually value for money, which we are still seeking further information on from the Home Office, we need to know that they are living in conditions that are not detrimental to their wellbeing.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that housing asylum claimants on Bibby Stockholm is leaving them in a claustrophobic environment, isolated from external support, including legal advice, and without important links to community, faith or family, potentially for months on end.\n\n\u201cSupport services on the barge must be adequate to meet the needs of those housed there, and if not, that there are practical steps in place to allow them to be accessed in the wider community.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe health and welfare of asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm is of the utmost priority, and we constantly work to ensure the needs and vulnerabilities of those residing on the vessel are identified and met. Asylum seekers are screened to identify vulnerable individuals and ensure they are placed in suitable accommodation.\n\n\u201cThere are rigorous safeguarding processes in place on the barge.

The Plymouth Brethren Christian sect has about 50,000 members worldwide and follows a doctrine of separation from the outside world.\n\nThe emails show a \u201cfounder\u201d of Unispace, whose name is redacted, spoke to Gove and followed up with an email later that day outlining his offer, and saying he was \u201cpraying fervently for all men and for you and the Conservative party at this difficult time\u201d. After another email, Gove replied: \u201cThank you [name redacted], we will follow up!\u201d\n\nGove\u2019s office subsequently forwarded an email from the Unispace founder to the office of Matt Hancock, the then health secretary, which directed the request through the Cabinet Office\u2019s Covid inbox.\n\nThe Cabinet Office said Unispace also approached the government\u2019s commercial function with a second offer in mid-April, and this is what led to it getting put into the VIP lane and subsequently winning the \u00a3680m of contracts. The first contract, worth \u00a3239.6m, was awarded on 20 April with another worth \u00a3114m awarded a week later. The Cabinet Office stressed that ministers made no decisions on procurement during the pandemic.\n\nThe government refused to be drawn on how Gove had come to speak to Unispace\u2019s founder directly at the height of the pandemic, and whether they had been corresponding on the minister\u2019s private email account.\n\nThe correspondence, with names redacted, was obtained by the Good Law Project.\n\nThe Cabinet Office describes the source of Unispace\u2019s referral as \u201cGCF COVID-19 Enquiries mailbox, Cabinet Office\u201d. GCF refers to the Government Commercial Function, a cross-government procurement network.\n\nMinisters were not involved in the decisions to award contracts to firms placed in the VIP lane, but the process has been criticised for making it more likely that firms with contacts among Conservative ministers and government figures won lucrative deals.\n\nA Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cUnispace directly contacted the Government Commercial Function who referred the offer to the High Priority Lane. Ministers had no involvement in these procurement decisions.\n\n\u201cIn the height of the pandemic, we had to act swiftly to procure PPE, competing in a global market where demand massively outstripped supply.\n\n\u201cPotential suppliers often passed on offers of PPE to MPs, civil servants and ministers \u2013 and these offers were then passed on to professional procurement specialists for assessment, with due diligence carried out on all companies in advance of procurement and every company subjected to the same checks.\u201d\n\nThe revelation also adds to the links between Gove and several recipients of the most controversial deals processed through the VIP lane during the pandemic. He was behind the referral of David Meller, a Conservative donor who had personally backed his leadership campaign. Meller\u2019s design firm won six PPE supply contracts worth \u00a3164m.\n\nGove was also mentioned in correspondence from Michelle Mone to another Cabinet Office minister in which she was offering to supply PPE \u201cthrough my team in Hong Kong\u201d, saying \u201cMichael Gove has asked to urgently contact you\u201d. Mone is subject to a National Crime Agency investigation and Lords standards commissioner investigation over the supply of PPE.\n\nUnispace won \u00a3680m of PPE contracts between April and August 2020. It was controlled by Hales and Hazell, before the design business of the company was sold to a Hong Kong buyer and the PPE contracts were transferred to another firm called Sant\u00e9 Global LLP in 2021.\n\nSant\u00e9 Global, whose partners include Gareth Hales and another brother, Charles Hales, is now in dispute with the UK government over another contract to provide lateral flow tests, which it says was wrongly terminated. One of Sant\u00e9\u2019s advisers has been Mark Fullbrook, a Tory strategist and the former chief of staff to Liz Truss, although it is understood he is not currently retained by the firm.\n\nSant\u00e9 Global did not reply to a request for comment."}

This year, the question of finance will dominate the agenda, which promises to be equally fraught.\n\nCurrent levels of finance to help poor countries cut their emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather are widely recognised as far too low. However, there is little agreement on how they can be increased.\n\nRich countries are under pressure to pledge more assistance to the poor, but the sums that will eventually be needed dwarf anything likely to come from public budgets. Instead, countries are looking to innovative forms of finance, from the public and private sector, that can reach trillions in investment each year.\n\n\u201cWe must spend the year working collectively to evolve our global financial system so it\u2019s fit-for-purpose, with a clear plan to meaningfully execute the climate transition,\u201d said Stiell. \u201cIt\u2019s already blazingly obvious that finance is the make-or-break factor in the world\u2019s climate fight.\u201d\n\nWithout the \u201ctorrents, not trickles\u201d of investment, the resolutions reached at Cop28 for countries to move away from fossil fuels would \u201cquickly fizzle away into more empty promises\u201d, he said.\n\nRachel Kyte, a former top climate official at the World Bank and adviser to the UN and governments, predicted a difficult year ahead for progress on the climate crisis, as more than 60 countries, covering more than half the global population, will hold elections in some form in 2024.\n\nThe results of the US election, and the campaigns, will have huge impacts on the UN Cop negotiations, as the likely Republican candidate, Donald Trump, took the first steps to withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement when he was last in office.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

They have allowed climate progress to be portrayed by populists on the left and the right as a tug of war between the person on the street in the global north and the global south.\u201d\n\nThis year is also likely to break global temperature records, as last year did. Heatwaves in the US and Europe last year would have been virtually impossible without the impacts of the human-made climate crisis, scientific research showed.\n\nThis year\u2019s host country for Cop29, Azerbaijan, has not played a high-profile role in the global climate negotiations up to now. The country is highly dependent on oil and gas, which make up about 90% of its exports, and plans to increase its oil and gas production capacity by about a third over the next decade.\n\nMukhtar Babayev, the president-designate of Cop29, spent 26 years working for the state oil company. The Azerbaijani government made a major false step early in its preparations, by unveiling an organising committee of 28 top officials that was all male. After an outcry, the president, Ilham Aliyev, enlarged the team to 29 men and 12 women.\n\nStiell and his team will help Azerbaijan to run Cop29, acting alongside the presidency to guide the year of talks, culminating in a two-week summit in November, with more than 190 countries expected to attend.\n\nA senior adviser to Stiell said: \u201cBasically this speech is about getting on with the job, and for the executive secretary, being a neutral broker is central to that job. So giving this speech in Baku, rather than Davos or any other place, made sense for him.\u201d"}

But as a young person living in a climate and environmental crisis, these worries have become increasingly hard to ignore. This has been made even harder by the fact that the climate crisis is killing my sport, and one of the companies most responsible is plastering its name all over football in England to distract from what it is doing.\n\nAs a professional footballer, I\u2019ve had the privilege of representing my country, New Zealand, 15 times. From being a champion of Italy with Juventus to playing most recently for Hearts in the Scottish Women\u2019s Premier League, I have been lucky enough to experience football in a variety of settings. The goal was always to use football as a means to experience the world, but it turns out the world I\u2019ve been experiencing isn\u2019t what I thought it would be.\n\nFor this reason I am using my career to fight for the defining issue of our generation: tackling climate change. Call me a hypocrite if you like \u2013 I would accept another call-up from New Zealand with all the travel involved \u2013 but nobody is perfect and that charge won\u2019t stop me from using my platform to encourage positive change.

Thank you for your feedback.\n\nWomen\u2019s football is more popular than ever but as the game grows we find ourselves at a turning point \u2013 one where we get to decide what our future looks like. What are our core values? Where do we want women\u2019s football to be in five or 10 years\u2019 time, and which organisations do we want to be working with?\n\nFrom the Lionesses securing \u00a3600m for girls\u2019 football in English schools, to the Afghanistan women\u2019s national team\u2019s fight against the Taliban, footballers are defining what our game will look like on a daily basis. We saw it consistently at last year\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup, including when 44 players launched football\u2019s biggest climate campaign. We\u2019re aware of our responsibility to help shape the future of our sport.\n\nWhich brings me to something I can\u2019t ignore. Barclays, the lead sponsor for the Women\u2019s Super League and Women\u2019s Championship in England, was the top European funder of fossil fuels between 2016 and 2022, according to the Rainforest Action Network\u2019s banking on climate chaos report. The report states that Barclays provided \u00a3149bn to the fossil fuel sector, including to Shell and TotalEnergies, whose products are driving up planet-warming emissions. This situation is sadly not unique to women\u2019s football but we have an opportunity \u2013 and I believe a duty \u2013 to change it.\n\nView image in fullscreen A Barclays advertising hoarding at Brighton\u2019s game against Chelsea last weekend. Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images\n\nAt the start of this year, Barclays launched its \u201cHere for the land of football\u201d campaign, joined by prominent footballers and aimed at investing more in the sport. I believe this is a cynical attempt to sportswash (the sporting equivalent of greenwashing) its image and use women\u2019s football as a distraction from the devastation it inflicts in the name of commercial success. It cares more about profits than about the future success of football, and in doing so threatens the planet on which football depends.\n\nClimate change will have a devastating impact on women\u2019s football. Last year I supported Football For Future\u2019s evidence to the Future of Women\u2019s Football Review, which laid bare this impact. Even at a professional level, women\u2019s football does not have the infrastructure to protect players from severe weather events, frozen pitches and extreme heat. Many women\u2019s teams do not play in their club\u2019s main stadium, affording them less control over facilities.\n\nView image in fullscreen Katie Rood in action for Lewes against Arsenal in 2020. Photograph: Gavin Ellis/TGS Photo/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nIn the 2022 Euros, the Lionesses were forced to train inside before their quarter-final against Spain owing to high temperatures. Last season, Chelsea\u2019s fixture against Liverpool was abandoned after six minutes because of a frozen pitch. Scientists agree climate change makes extreme weather more likely. We are already seeing how the climate crisis is threatening the beautiful game.\n\nClimate change will also exacerbate almost every inequality that exists between men and women, disproportionately affecting women\u2019s and girls\u2019 ability to perform everyday tasks. While I fight for climate action in football, one of our sponsors is funding the destruction of habitats that communities depend on to survive.\n\nBarclays touts its investment in women and girls, claiming \u201cfootball belongs to all of us\u201d. But any positive impact it has had in advancing women\u2019s football is fundamentally undermined by the impact it is having on our planet.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free newsletter No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women\u2019s football Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We\u2019ve fought for generations to get the game to where it is today and as we grow we must take care to do so in a way that is in line with our values and secures a positive future.\n\nThis is our moment to be bold and to continue to show the world a new way. There\u2019s plenty more progress to be made, and we have a huge opportunity to align with an organisation that will lead the way with us, towards a brighter future. It is time to hold Barclays accountable. It may claim to be inspiring the next generation to play football, but its destructive actions will leave no planet to play on.\n\nKatie Rood is a footballer, a Kiwi and a vegan.

We have supported over 2,900 community sports groups to make football more accessible through the Barclays Community Football Fund and are supporting the ambition to provide equal access for girls to football in schools through the Barclays Girls\u2019 Football Schools Partnerships, increasing the number from around 3,000 schools to almost 20,000 since 2019.\n\nTo reach net zero, investment is needed to support current and future global energy demand, including oil and gas, as renewable energy is scaled up. Barclays is supporting energy companies transition with a $1tn target of financing, whilst investing \u00a3500m in the climate tech necessary for decarbonisation. As the number two clean energy adviser globally, we are playing a significant role towards financing real world decarbonisation."}

The demonstration was peaceful, passed off without incident and earned a brief mention on the evening news. But suppose for a moment that it had gone the other way. Suppose it spiralled into violence and sparked a full-blown Welsh rebellion. In which case, Port Talbot is no longer a fading industrial town. It\u2019s a hotbed of revolution; a signpost to the future.\n\nThis, in a nutshell, is the premise of The Way, a boisterous BBC drama about a parallel Britain that\u2019s just a shuffle step from our own. It\u2019s a tale of civil war and family strife, a series that installs a militarised hard border between England and Wales and effectively turns all the Celts into outlaws. It used to be that people visited border town Hay-on-Wye to buy books. Now they come seeking shelter and a secret route into England.\n\nThe Way was devised and directed by the actor Michael Sheen. He recruited Sherwood author James Graham to write the script and convinced the documentary film-maker Adam Curtis to step in as an executive producer. But he also cast his home town as the drama\u2019s chief location, the molten core of his tale. \u201cThe thing about Port Talbot is that it\u2019s haunted by the ghosts of uprisings past,\u201d he explains, of the bullish 20th-century steel town turned scrappy, post-industrial survivor. \u201cIt\u2019s got that dormant rebel spirit in its DNA. The whole town feels like a dragon slumbering in a cave.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Scene setter \u2026 Michael Sheen outside Port Talbot. Photograph: BBC\n\nSheen, like Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins before him, graduated from Port Talbot to pursue a lucrative acting career in London and Los Angeles. Unlike them, though, he has since circled back and now lives locally. He thinks that the catalyst was the acclaimed 72-hour production of The Passion that he staged in the town back in 2011. It reconnected him with his roots, helped him understand the place in the round.\n\n\u201cSo that feeling of coming back to my home town and it also being a set is something I\u2019d experienced before,\u201d he says. \u201cThe difference was that this production took longer. This involved me shutting down the high street for a week. Obviously, people aren\u2019t going to be so nice about that. But I knew I had a bit of trust left over from The Passion that I could still use up.\u201d\n\nThe Way bustles around town like a native, steering us from the plant to the shops to the suburbs to the beach as the protests spread and the police crack down. Its focus, though, is on the revolutionary Driscoll family (estranged mum and dad; troubled adult siblings) as they escape through Afan Forest Park with the British army in hot pursuit. Each Driscoll, in their way, has been shaped and scarred by the steelworks. It\u2019s almost like a relative: the mean old uncle in the corner.\n\nCardiff-born Mali Harries plays the role of Dee Driscoll, the tale\u2019s redoubtable Mother Courage. Harries recalls being driven past the steelworks as a kid. She was spooked by the size and the noise and the stink. \u201cMassive towers. Lots of steam. I used to dream about getting a giant Berocca tablet to put down the chimneys and clean all the pollution.\u201d From afar, she admits that the place looks ominous. \u201cBut once you get into the community you see it\u2019s full of heart, generosity and good humour. As a child you see the towers and the smoke. As an adult you get to see all of the people as well.\u201d\n\nRhondda-born Callum Scott Howells co-stars as Owen, the Driscolls\u2019 upstart addict son. He suspects that he, too, tended to steer clear of the place in his youth. \u201cThe closest I got to Port Talbot was passing through it on the way to walk the Mumbles Mile with my parents,\u201d he says. \u201cYou drive past on the M4 and the steelworks just tower over the town, so it\u2019s not the obvious place for a day trip. It\u2019s only now that I realise it\u2019s really not too different from where I\u2019m from, which is an old mining community. It\u2019s all part of the same post-industrial Welsh landscape.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Riot actor \u2026 Mali Harries as Dee Driscoll in The Way. Photograph: BBC\n\nHowells remains best known for his performance as Colin, the tragic valleys kid from Russell T Davies\u2019s It\u2019s a Sin. Ideally, he says, he would like to shoot more roles in south Wales. There is a rich seam of Welsh stories just waiting to be told. The difficulty comes in transporting them, intact, to the screen. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so unusual about The Way,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an epic tale on an epic scale. It shows we can tell these big stories in Wales, using Welsh actors and a Welsh crew, without diluting them one bit. Hopefully it raises the bar for what Welsh television can do.\u201d\n\nBack in the drama, the Driscolls are in flight. They\u2019re steering their slaloming course along the Welsh border while the story keeps pace, zig-zagging wildly beside them. The scenery keeps shifting. The script grinds its gears. The Way sets forth as an urgent social-realist saga and then starts skipping through the genres without ever quite settling. It references The Wizard of Oz and WB Yeats\u2019s The Second Coming. It\u2019s an unruly rough beast; it keeps us all on our toes.\n\n\u201cYeah, there\u2019s a strange tone to it,\u201d Sheen agrees. \u201cYou don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re in a horror film or a sitcom or a farce. We wanted it to be constantly surprising, to reflect what we\u2019ve all been going through these last 10 years. The absurdity of reality. The situation that we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nThis leads us inevitably to the desk of Adam Curtis, the creator of landmark documentaries Bitter Lake and The Power of Nightmares. Curtis is officially credited as The Way\u2019s executive producer, which is another way of saying that he\u2019s its touchstone, its mentor. A standard dystopian drama wouldn\u2019t have interested him in the slightest. The Way\u2019s skittish nature, though, proved to be its main selling point.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to What's On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whereas this just gets odder and odder. It hints at how we may be able to break free from all the tired old structures that are holding us back.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018There\u2019s something satisfying about turning the place where you grew up into an apocalyptic bombsite\u2019 \u2026 Michael Sheen on filming in his home town. Photograph: BBC\n\nCurtis is ostensibly talking about TV drama here. But TV frames the wider world and he fears that our stories have become threadbare and exhausted. \u201cThis is an old country that\u2019s being held back by old memories, old myths. All we are left with is a terrible nostalgia and a set of categories that don\u2019t actually speak to the world we\u2019re living in now.\u201d The Way\u2019s not dystopian, he says; that\u2019s a lazy category error. Come to think of it, he\u2019s not entirely happy with it being described as a Port Talbot tale either. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d he cautions. \u201cYou can get too lost in that. I see it more as a parable of our country. It\u2019s a story about our society that just happens to be set in Wales.\u201d\n\nOne thing about home: we never truly escape it. It haunts us if we stay and it haunts us if we leave. That\u2019s been Sheen\u2019s experience. It\u2019s what makes The Way feel so personal. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a big political story,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s also my story. It taps into all of my feelings about home.\u201d\n\nOff screen, Port Talbot faces an uncertain future. The blast furnaces are closing with the loss of nearly 3,000 jobs. Residents feel that the place may soon become a ghost town. On screen, if anything, the situation is more extreme. This parallel Port Talbot has become the revolution\u2019s ground zero. It\u2019s the war\u2019s first battleground; possibly its first casualty, too.\n\n\u201cI remember reading about how HG Wells set The War of the Worlds in his home town of Woking,\u201d Sheen says. \u201cI think Edgar Wright did the same thing, setting Hot Fuzz in Wells. So there\u2019s a small tradition that I\u2019m now a part of, where people set stories in their home town and then blow it up.\u201d He grins at the thought. \u201cThere\u2019s something satisfying about turning the place where you grew up into an apocalyptic bombsite. Destroying your home town. But destroying it with love.\u201d\n\nThe Way is coming soon to BBC iPlayer and BBC One."}

But there\u2019s method in the madness", "domain": "theguardian.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBggKMJeqezDfswk", "text": "You could say it\u2019s the role she was born to play. This month sees the release of This Is Me \u2026 Now: A Love Story, a full-length movie in which Jennifer Affleck (nee Lopez) transforms herself into the legendary American singer, actress and pop culture icon known as \u2026 J-Lo. Yes, she\u2019s playing herself, or at least a rather strange version of herself.\n\nThe trailer for the film, which is being released exclusively via Amazon Prime, could not have been better designed for social media intrigue. It features a tear-strewn therapy session, death-defying motorcycle crashes and a staged intervention from J-Lo\u2019s friends in which they put it to her that she\u2019s a sex addict. To be fair, there does seem to be a lot of sex in the movie, or at least a lot of rugged dry-humping, and she marries at least three men in one scene. But the raunch takes second stage to the dazzling musical numbers \u2013 a line of pink tuxedo-clad men are seen twirling umbrellas in garden mazes at one point. Astonishingly, this high-budget affair is all just a promotional tool to let us know about J-Lo\u2019s ninth album (also called This Is Me \u2026 Now).\n\nIf this seems slightly bananas, then it\u2019s perhaps no more so than recent J-Lo developments, all of which you would be hard-pushed to be described as anything other than \u201ccurveballs\u201d: first her 2021 reunion with (and subsequent marriage) to Affleck, who she\u2019d previously dated from 2002 to 2004; more recently news that she would be producing a future Bob the Builder movie, one in which the eponymous tradesman travels to Puerto Rico as Roberto to embark on what has been described as a \u201cmajor construction job\u201d.\n\nBut believe it or not, there is method in the madness here, at least when it comes to the new film which taps into the current trend of pop stars harnessing cinemas as key focal points in promotional campaigns. J-Lo\u2019s new album is billed as a follow-up to her third album 2002\u2019s This Is Me \u2026 Then, which was released in the wake of her getting together with Affleck the first time around. Hyping it via the popcorn route follows in the footsteps of Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9, who both gave theatrical releases to their gargantuan Eras and Renaissance tours respectively. The difference here is that rather than repurpose concert footage to make more cash from punters who couldn\u2019t get tickets to the live show, J-Lo has pushed the boat out by possibly inventing the \u201ctherapy-musical biopic\u201d genre, billing it as \u201cthe most personal thing I\u2019ve ever done\u201d. It even stars Affleck, although how he feels about the trailer\u2019s key line \u201cnot all love stories have a happy ending\u201d is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nIn recent years, cinemas have become focal points for big events rather than, say, somewhere you can slump quietly and watch a film, places where punters dress up, take friends and dance in the aisles. The Barbie movie encouraged a wave of hot pink outfits, and TikTok is awash with footage from the Eras tour, in which viewers storm the front to sing along arm-in-arm. Last year, Talking Heads re-released their iconic concert film Stop Making Sense in cinemas prompting similarly raucous responses (and the announcement of a covers album, Everyone\u2019s Getting Involved: A Tribute to Talking Heads\u2019 Stop Making Sense, overseen by film and entertainment giant A24). Pet Shop Boys\u2019 concert film Dreamworld: Greatest Hits also hit cinemas this week, the final showing of which will be this Sunday (4 February).\n\nJ-Lo isn\u2019t the only musician to envisage going beyond a concert film to promote their album. Last month British-American rapper 21 Savage announced American Dream: The 21 Savage Story, a similarly ambitious looking, no-expense-spared biopic starring Donald Glover. But unlike J-Lo, 21 Savage eventually admitted that the trailer was a parody, a wind up serving only to promote his record. J-Lo doesn\u2019t seem to be concerned with such half measures.\n\nAnd why should she? Unlike Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 et al, she has long presided over both the film and music industries, with this year alone also seeing her star in the science-fiction thriller Atlas and the biographical sports drama Unstoppable. You could just as easily argue that the album is promoting the film \u2013 and if anyone is well placed to get away with something this bonkers then it\u2019s probably J-Lo."}

Hamas is understood to be asking for up to 150 Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for each hostage as well as eyeing the release of senior figures, such as Marwan Barghouti.\n\nLater a Hamas official in Beirut, Osama Hamdan, also reiterated that any deal short of a permanent ceasefire was likely to be rejected.\n\nIsraeli ministers have been quick to voice opposition to the length of the proposed ceasefire, arguing that it would make it more difficult for Israel to return to offensive operations against Hamas. According to a report on Israel\u2019s Channel N12, ministers at a cabinet meeting on Thursday night opposed a ceasefire of longer than a month.\n\nAmid mounting international concern about the increasingly desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza, where more than half of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced south to Rafah on the Egyptian border, Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, suggested on Thursday that Rafah itself could be the next target of operations.\n\n\u201cThe Khan Younis Brigade of the Hamas organisation is dismantled; we complete the mission and will continue to Rafah,\u201d Gallant said in a message posted on social media.\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of people crammed into the city, many living in tents in unsanitary conditions and with little access to aid or medical care, on Friday the UN\u2019s humanitarian office described Rafah as a \u201cpressure cooker of despair\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want to emphasise our deep concern about the escalation of hostilities in Khan Younis, which has resulted in an increase in the number of internally displaced people seeking refuge in Rafah in recent days,\u201d said Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \u201cRafah is a pressure cooker of despair, and we fear for what comes next.\u201d\n\nGaza residents have said Israeli forces have pounded areas around hospitals in Khan Younis and stepped up attacks close to Rafah.\n\nLaerke said: \u201cKhan Younis has also come increasingly under attack and it\u2019s been shocking to hear about the heavy fighting in the vicinity of the hospitals, jeopardising the safety of medical staff, the wounded and sick, as well as thousands of internally displaced people seeking refuge there. Agencies are indeed struggling to respond under these circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn separate comments, Unicef said it estimated that 17,000 children in Gaza were unaccompanied or had been separated from their families during the conflict, which began on 7 October after attacks by Hamas gunmen in southern Israel.\n\nIt said nearly all children in the strip were thought to require mental health support. \u201cThey present symptoms like extremely high levels of persistent anxiety, loss of appetite. They can\u2019t sleep, they have emotional outbursts or they panic every time they hear a bombing,\u201d said Jonathan Crickx, Unicef\u2019s chief of communication for the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\n\u201cBefore this war, Unicef was considering already that 500,000 children were in need of mental health and psychosocial support in Gaza,\u201d Crickx added. \u201cToday we estimate that almost all children are in need of that support \u2013 and that\u2019s more than 1 million children.\u201d"}

The ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office catapulted the latest hearings into focus. Here are four main points from the most recent hearings, which started in January, covering policy, audits and investigations.\n\nThe inquiry, led by the retired high court judge Sir Wyn Williams, will reopen in central London in the spring, with evidence from the former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells and the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, who was postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012.\n\nFujitsu knew about Horizon bugs back in 1999\n\nFujitsu\u2019s Europe chief, Paul Patterson, told the inquiry he found it \u201cshameful and appalling\u201d that courts hearing cases against post office operators over missing funds were not told of 29 bugs in the system it built, some of which had been identified as early as 1999.\n\n00:00:55 'Shameful and appalling': Fujitsu boss apologises for Horizon failings \u2013 video\n\nWhen bugs were acknowledged, the Post Office edited witness statements from Fujitsu staff due to be heard in court as it sought to maintain the line that the system was working well.\n\nPatterson agreed that both organisations had failed those accused. \u201cI am surprised that that detail [that bugs had been identified] was not included in the witness statements given by Fujitsu staff to the Post Office and I have seen some evidence of editing witness statements by others,\u201d he said. The prosecution of post office operators based on unreliable evidence only ended in 2014.\n\nThe Post Office has failed to disclose evidence\n\nThe Post Office has admitted failing to properly disclose thousands of relevant documents and thousands of emails but its lawyers informed the inquiry that it was no longer realistic to ask them to work evenings and weekends searching for relevant evidence.\n\n\u201cThe principle of reasonableness in relation to disclosure to the inquiry \u2013 even if operating at the more stringent end of the spectrum \u2013 does not, and cannot, require POL [the Post Office] to leave every stone unturned,\u201d wrote the Post Office\u2019s lead legal representative, Chris Jackson, a partner at the law firm Burges Salmon LLP. \u201cSuch a standard is impossible for POL to realistically comply with.\u201d\n\nThe organisation\u2019s past and present leadership has also not provided the inquiry with any WhatsApp messages on the basis that senior figures within the organisation claimed it was not used for \u201csubstantive\u201d discussions. \u201cIt may be a surprise to a member of the public that no one in the Post Office used WhatsApp to discuss issues of substance relating to the Horizon system,\u201d said Jason Beer, the lead counsel to the inquiry.\n\nUnrepentant prosecutors\n\nRaymond Grant, a Post Office investigator, told the inquiry that he still believed that the man he helped prosecute, William Quarm, was guilty. Quarm, a father of five, died in 2012 not knowing he would eventually have his conviction for embezzlement overturned 11 years later.\n\nGrant was legally forced to give testimony at the public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal. He provided the barest bones of a witness statement, at just over two pages, criticising the inquiry for not giving him enough time to do more because it clashed with his Christmas plans.\n\n00:02:29 Former Post Office investigator insists cleared Horizon IT victim was guilty \u2013 video\n\nGrant said he glanced at 78 documents the inquiry asked him to review as he was too busy at his job at the Salvation Army organising activities such as carol singing, making Christmas dinners and walking his dog. He later apologised for his role in the scandal and accused the Post Office of deceiving him. However, he was not the only former investigator who appeared to believe that some post office operators who have now been cleared were nevertheless up to no good.\n\nFrederick Thorpe, a former Post Office investigator involved in the criminal investigation of Alan McLaughlin and Maureen McKelvey, had to be reminded by the counsel at the inquiry that both of them were innocent. During his testimony he said McLaughlin had \u201cmanipulated the cash account\u201d and that \u201cwhat he was doing was still wrong\u201d.\n\nStephen Bradshaw, an investigator who denied claims he and his colleagues had acted like \u201cmafia gangsters\u201d, disputed an account of him calling one female suspect a \u201cbitch\u201d but admitted to accusing another of telling a \u201cpack of lies\u201d during what he conceded were \u201cnot nice\u201d interviews. He insisted he had acted professionally.\n\nFujitsu has a \u00a32.4bn contract \u2013 but would not fix defects\n\nThe Horizon contract was extended last year to run until at least 2025, and is estimated to be worth \u00a32.4bn. However, the inquiry heard from Gerald Barnes, a software developer at Fujitsu since 1998 who repeatedly raised the issue of bugs in the Horizon IT system, that the company did not fix the problem because it would have been too expensive and time-consuming.\n\n\u201cError handling wasn\u2019t as good as it could have been if designed properly from the start,\u201d he told the inquiry. \u201cThe better thing to do is to make sure the [Horizon Online] software works. It would have just been too expensive to do a thorough job at that stage. It would have been uneconomic. To comprehensively rewrite the error handling would be a massive job. It would be extremely expensive.\u201d\n\nIt also emerged that data from the Horizon IT system, which was responsible for the wrongful prosecution of more than 900 post office operators, is still used in continuing legal cases."}

Announcing the policy in December, she declared: \u201cIt is a form of social justice.\u201d Paris will hold a referendum on Monday asking residents to vote for or against a specific parking tariff for heavy, large and polluting SUVs.\n\nKhan welcomed Hidalgo\u2019s plan and said he would watch it closely. He told the Guardian: \u201cWe always examine policies around the globe. I\u2019m a firm believer in stealing good policies. Rather than inventing [new policies] badly, if other cities are doing stuff that works, we will copy them.\u201d\n\nKhan said he knew SUVs were a particular problem that needed to be tackled: \u201cSUVs take up more space and we know there\u2019s issues around road safety, we know there\u2019s issues around carbon emissions and so forth. We know some councils in London are taking bold policies in relation to parking fees, in relation to your tickets and so forth. It\u2019s really good to work with those councils.\u201d\n\nLarge sport vehicles are a cause of rising transport pollution, according to research. While they are billed as vehicles designed to cover rough ground or tow heavy loads, research has shown that three-quarters of SUVs bought new in the UK are registered to people living in urban areas. A recent study found that the effect of rising sales of SUVs, and the fact they tend to be heavier than the traditional models previously bought, means the average conventional-engined car bought in 2023 had higher carbon emissions than its 2013 equivalent.\n\nElla grew up near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south-east London, and developed asthma just before her seventh birthday. The asthma attacks left her struggling to breathe and she required frequent hospital visits. A few weeks after her ninth birthday she suffered a fatal asthma attack.\n\nIn December 2020 the coroner concluded that air pollution contributed to Ella\u2019s death, and she became the first person in the world to have it recorded as a cause of death on her death certificate.\n\nElla\u2019s mother, Rosamund, said justice for her daughter would be served when the UK government passed strong air quality laws to prevent other children suffering a similar fate.\n\nShe said: \u201cI would like to thank the mayor for his apology on behalf of the city today. Nothing will ever make up for the pain and suffering that Ella went through, and nothing will ever make up for the pain and suffering my family has been through since losing her in such circumstances.\n\n\u201cMy goal has always been to stop other children from suffering like Ella did. My family and I will continue to fight for the health of all children and, with everyone\u2019s support, one day we will get justice for Ella Roberta.\u201d\n\nAdoo-Kissi-Debrah has been campaigning for \u201cElla\u2019s law\u201d, which would establish a right to clean air and set up a commission to oversee government actions and progress. It would also join policies on indoor and outdoor air pollution with actions to combat the climate emergency and include annual reviews of the latest science.\n\nKhan said a Labour government would put this legislation in place. \u201cThe Labour party supported the private member\u2019s bill that started with the House of Lords with [the Green peer] Jenny Jones,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the government\u2019s done is remarkable in the sense they kick the can down the road and say: \u2018Yeah, we agree with that. But we\u2019ll do it in 18 years\u2019 time\u2019.\u201d"}

Why, in the UK, can you now potentially receive a longer sentence for \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d \u2013 non-violent civil disobedience \u2013 than for rape or manslaughter? Why are ordinary criminals being released early to make space in overcrowded prisons, only for the space to be refilled with political prisoners: people trying peacefully to defend the habitable planet?\n\nThere\u2019s a simple explanation. It was clearly expressed by a former analyst at the US Department of Homeland Security. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a bunch of companies coming forward saying: \u2018I wish you\u2019d do something about these rightwing extremists.\u2019\u201d The disproportionate policing of environmental protest, the new offences and extreme sentences, the campaigns of extrajudicial persecution by governments around the world are not, as politicians constantly assure us, designed to protect society. They\u2019re a response to corporate lobbying.\n\nLast week the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on environmental defenders, Michel Forst, issued the kind of bulletin you might expect to see written about the Sisi regime in Egypt or Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. But it concerned the UK. It noted that draconian anti-protest laws, massive sentences and court rulings forbidding protesters from explaining their motives to juries are crushing \u201cfundamental freedoms\u201d here. He pointed out that until recently it was very rare \u201cfor members of the public to be imprisoned for peaceful protest in the UK\u201d. Now you can get six months merely for marching.\n\nHe also highlighted the outrageous treatment of people convicted of no crime. Peaceful environmental campaigners are being held on bail for up to two years, subjected to electronic tags, GPS tracking and curfews, and deprived of their social lives and political rights. This is one of many examples of process as punishment. Even before you have been tried, let alone found guilty, your life is shredded.\n\nThis bombshell report was ignored by almost all the media. You shouldn\u2019t be surprised. With a few exceptions, the media belongs to the corporate-political complex that demanded these laws. All over the world, the billionaire press has been demonising peaceful campaigners and lobbying for ever more oppressive measures against those who challenge destructive industries.\n\nHowever absurd the media\u2019s hyperbole, governments rush to meet its demands. In Germany, the authorities launched an organised crime investigation into the environmental protest movement Letzte Generation. Italy is using anti-mafia laws against an allied group of environmental defenders, Ultima Generazione. In France and the US, peaceful green protesters are labelled and treated as terrorists. These governments must know they aren\u2019t dealing with organised crime, the mafia or terrorists. But by using these labels they hope to isolate and ostracise peaceful protesters while justifying a madly disproportionate legal response.\n\nView image in fullscreen Police officers carry away a Letzte Generation protester in front of the chancellery in Berlin, Germany, October 2023. Photograph: Markus Schreiber/AP\n\nIn many cases, laws are proposed or drafted by corporate-funded lobby groups masquerading as thinktanks, such as Policy Exchange in the UK and the American Legislative Exchange Council in the US. Such groups create legal templates for crushing protest movements, then press for their adoption all over the world. This tactic has been chillingly effective.\n\nIn the UK, the government has truncated parliamentary scrutiny to force extreme measures on to the statute books. Judges have jailed environmental defenders for seeking to tell the jury why they took their actions. In 2023, two peaceful protesters who unveiled a banner on a bridge, Marcus Decker and Morgan Trowland, were handed sentences of two and a half and three years: the longest of their kind in modern history. Decker, a German citizen living with his partner in the UK, now faces deportation when he is released. There is nothing just or proportionate about any of this.\n\nEven worse, both public authorities and corporations have been dropping injunctions on people who have protested, and, for that matter, those they believe might protest. As the UN rapporteur pointed out, many peaceful protesters are \u201cbeing punished twice for the same action\u201d: facing both criminal trials and civil injunctions. Simply being named on an injunction exposes you to potentially massive financial penalties, as the named people \u2013 the defendants \u2013 typically have to pay the legal costs of the claimants. If the defendants challenge the injunction, the costs can spiral into hundreds of thousands of pounds. I\u2019ve been contacted by several people who have never committed a crime, who have told me they are being ruined by inclusion on these lists. These costs are, in effect, fines that can be levied by either public or private bodies against anyone who disagrees with them. They amount to punishment of the poor by the rich. Corporations become, in effect, prosecuting authorities.\n\nWorse still, the police can also slap an injunction on peaceful campaigners, even if they\u2019ve done nothing to offend the law. Last year, Surrey police handed an \u201cantisocial behaviour injunction\u201d to Colin Shearn, a retired corporate executive, on the grounds that he had been asking \u201cendless questions about air traffic\u201d at Farnborough airport. His questions, letters and information requests were polite and considered, but this, apparently, counts for nothing. By pure coincidence, three weeks after its most effective critic was silenced by this injunction, Farnborough airport announced that it planned to double the number of weekend flights.\n\nWhy is all this happening? Because the UK, the US and many other nations have become closed shops run by the plutocrats\u2019 trade union. This political capture also explains why, despite the alleged perversions of justice that ruined the lives of so many subpostmasters, none of the senior figures at the Post Office or its contracting companies have been held accountable. It explains why, in the US, you can be imprisoned for possession of a few grams of narcotics, yet no pharmaceutical executive has been sent to jail for peddling opioids that have killed 800,000 people. It tells us why, in the UK, no company has yet been prosecuted for tax evasion under the 2017 Criminal Finances Act, and why Rishi Sunak\u2019s government repeatedly sabotaged parliament\u2019s attempts to clamp down on major white-collar crime. The powerful are protected while the powerless are exposed to ever more inventive laws.\n\nInequality demands oppression. The more concentrated wealth and power become, the more those who challenge the rich and powerful must be hounded and crushed. In other words, economic inequality is mirrored by inequality before the law. You can dispense with all the other indices of democracy. The best measure of the health of a political system is who gets prosecuted."}

Levittown is a suburb around 25 miles northeast of Philadelphia's center.\n\nOfficers found the head wrapped in plastic inside a large pot, a machete and large kitchen knife in the bathtub, according to court documents.\n\nJustin Mohn faces charges of first-degree murder, possession of an instrument of crime, and abuse of a corpse.\n\nIn a grisly 14-minute video posted to YouTube on Tuesday evening, Justin Mohn held up his father's head in a plastic bag.

While he targeted employees of the federal governments, Schorn said, his threats did not apply to state government employees.\n\nThe video posted online by Mohn racked up more than 5,000 views before YouTube removed it. \"It's quite horrifying how many views we understand it had before it was taken down,\" Schorn said.\n\nAuthorities said Justin Mohn fled the scene in his father's white Toyota Corolla to Fort Indiantown Gap, around 100 miles away, the site of a large National Guard Training Center. He drove the vehicle through the Center's barricades and climbed a barbed wire fence. Local police were able to track him by pinging his phone and arrested him \"without incident,\" Schorn said.\n\nUpon his arrest, he told officers he went to the center in an attempt to convince the National Guard to take up arms against the federal government, Schorn said. \"He also indicated that he wanted to speak to Governor Shapiro to join forces,\" she said, referring to Gov.

Schorn said Justin Mohn has \"no history of diagnosed mental health issues.\"\n\nAn autopsy of the elder Mohn found that he was shot in the head before he was decapitated, Schorn said.\n\nMiddletown Township Police had two documented interactions with Justin Mohn, Chief Joseph Bartorilla said at the press conference. The first occurred in 2011, when police were called over an argument between the then 19-year-old and someone in his driveway.\n\nIn 2019, Bartorilla said, Justin Mohn called police to report threats from an employee at the insurance company Progressive, where he previously worked at a Colorado Springs office.\n\nIn 2017, he sued the insurance company for sex-based discrimination after his application for a copywriter job was denied, according to court documents.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Friday, February 2nd, 2024. This is The Excerpt. Today, the latest from Yemen, where the US has launched another attack on Houthi military assets, plus a look at the importance of the Black vote in South Carolina for President Joe Biden. And would it even be a Friday if we didn't mention Taylor Swift?\n\n\u2666\n\nThe US military yesterday destroyed a ground control station and 10 drones in areas of Yemen controlled by the Houthis. It's the latest operation targeting their assets since the militant group began attacking commercial and Navy ships in the Red Sea. US Central Command said in a statement that the strikes were carried out in self-defense because the targets, quote, \"presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the US Navy ships in the area,\" unquote. Houthis began a missile and drone campaign on Red Sea shipping lanes in November that has forced cargo vessels to seek other routes and raised the cost of shipping. Houthis say their attacks are meant to show solidarity with Palestinians and Gaza, ravaged by Israel strikes there in the wake of the October 7th Hamas attacks in Israel. You can find all the latest on usatoday.com.\n\n\u2666\n\nBlack voters are being asked to show up and show out for President Joe Biden in South Carolina's Democratic presidential primary tomorrow. Biden is expected to win in the state, but how he fares with Black voters could set the stage for the rest of his campaign. I spoke with USA Today National Correspondent Deborah Barfield Berry for more. Deborah, thanks for hopping on The Excerpt.\n\nDeborah Barfield Berry:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhy is it so important for the Biden campaign to turn out Black voters in South Carolina? What signal, Deborah, would this give to the rest of the country?\n\nDeborah Barfield Berry:\n\nWell, one of the reasons why they're focusing on South Carolina and actually moved it up in the Democratic primary process is because it's a diverse state. Nearly 30% of the population in South Carolina is African American. And traditionally, African Americans have been the base core supporters of Democrats, particularly Biden. South Carolina particularly helped him win the election, at least get momentum going in 2020. So what they hope to do or what they're aiming to do is to also turn out Black voters here, hoping that in some ways, it would also give momentum as he goes forward to Super Tuesday and other upcoming primaries and other diverse population states.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd, Deborah, who is leading get-out-the-vote efforts in the Palmetto state? Is this a local, a state, or a national effort?\n\nDeborah Barfield Berry:\n\nActually, it tells a little bit of everybody. The National Democratic Party has put big money into the state, both in terms of advertising and then some work on the ground. The State Democratic Party has been doing a lot of work there as well, knocking on doors, making phone calls, trying to get voters out. But there's been a lot of movement and a lot of groundwork, if you will, from local grassroots groups and activists who are determined to do just the same, get voters out.\n\nIn addition to that, some groups from the outside, civic engagement groups, national civic engagement groups like Black Voters Matter, they just hosted a three-day conference in Charleston, where they trained some young college-age activists as well as brought down some of the activists from other organizations to learn how to canvas, to learn how to do it, not only in South Carolina, but later on.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, interesting stuff, Deborah. So how do Black voters there feel about being really such a big part of the election conversation?\n\nDeborah Barfield Berry:\n\nJosh Morgan and I have spent the last week down there talking to voters from North Charleston to Charleston to Columbia to Sumter. Some voters felt like they aren't paid as much attention this cycle as they were last time, partly because Biden is projected to easily win this time, whereas before it was a much more competitive feel. He had just lost a couple of primaries. But when I'm talking to the activists though, they still feel like it's important for voters to show up because they want to show that they are important, that this is an important state that it represents. It could be a symbol or an indicator of things to come. So you got a little mix of folks who will want to do it. You got some folks who are saying, \"Will it matter?\" I talked to some young folks who are feeling like they were being taken for granted and not as enthused as some others are. So it looks like he still has some work to do. There's still some folks who aren't convinced that this is the right path for them.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThat's true nationwide among Black voters as well. Biden has seen his grip on Black voters nationally slip recently. Deborah, what does polling tell us here, and are there issues in policies in particular that he's really struggling to connect on with Black voters?\n\nDeborah Barfield Berry:\n\nSome folks say they don't really know what he's done. They don't feel like he's done enough. The argument that supporters bring up, particularly like Representative James Clyburn, who's one of his biggest advocates, is that they have to do a better job of delivering that message to touting and relaying what those accomplishments are. So he's quick to do that on the campaign trail, especially in South Carolina. But then you have some younger voters both in South Carolina as well as up in DC and in Maryland, other places where I've interviewed people, who are really feeling some kind of way about Biden not calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Israeli-Hamas war. And they are really passionate about the administration doing a better job of protecting Palestinians. That issue is resonating or having them feeling some kind of way enough that some of them are saying they might look at alternative candidates or not vote at all. And that's a big risk for a person like Biden, who has relied on the Black vote or Black voters. So that doesn't necessarily bode well for him going into the primary and into the primary season.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDeborah Barfield Berry is a national correspondent for USA Today. Thank you, Deborah.\n\nDeborah Barfield Berry:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\n\u2666\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis announced yesterday that he's sending National and State Guard members to Texas so they can assist with placing razor wire along the southern border. This comes after the Supreme Court ruled last week that the federal government can remove any razor wire or other barriers that the Texas government puts up. DeSantis said in his announcement that states have to band together and pledged up to 1,000 National Guard members and State Guard volunteers. Critics called his language inflammatory and said the razor wire is not discouraging migrants. Many are risking injury to get through it. Other Republican-led states have loaned their own National Guard troops on border missions to Texas, including Oklahoma and Iowa.\n\n\u2666\n\nThat photo of Taylor Swift kissing her boyfriend, tight end Travis Kelce, is seemingly everywhere these days, and that has Republicans worried. Some Republicans are voicing concerns that Taylor Swift could influence the election in favor of President Joe Biden. The billionaire pop star who has encouraged her fans to vote for Democrats is now becoming the focus of right-wing conspiracies.\n\nThis week, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity accused Swift of misunderstanding Republican values and warned her against endorsing Biden. Other Republicans are going as far to speculate that Swift has been planted by the Pentagon to swing the 2024 presidential election and also to boost the fortunes of the Kansas City Chiefs, who are headed into the Super Bowl with Swift's boyfriend, Travis Kelce. Influential right-wing commentator Jack Posobiec and former presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy are among those raising questions. Swift has a massive, dedicated fan base, and though she spent years staying out of politics, she has repeatedly urged her fans to vote. Last fall, she's credited with getting more than 30,000 people registered in a single day.\n\n\u2666\n\nTiny ants managed to kill a bunch of African buffalo. The story shows us what can happen when an invasive species arrives. I spoke with USA Today National Correspondent Elizabeth Weise to learn more. Beth, thanks for helping on The Excerpt today.\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nHappy to be here as always.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThis is a crazy story. I feel like I say that whenever you're on really, Beth. But how did tiny ants manage to push lions to kill more African buffalo?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nThe big-headed ants show up. Big-headed ants are voracious, and they will eat anything, including the eggs of other ants. So they basically got out into the savanna and started eating up all the eggs of the native acacia ants, which live there and have always lived there. So the acacia ants disappear. It turns out that the acacia ants live in these thorny trees called whistling thorn trees that elephants like to eat. They have their long snout, and they reach into the tree, and they grab a bunch of leaves. At the end of the snout, they're nostrils, right? So it's very delicate, and they stuff it in their mouth.\n\nAnd they're happy, except that if they do that on a tree that's got acacia ants, the native ants that have always lived there, they will go in and swarm the elephant's snout, basically race up its snout, and start biting it from the inside. The elephants hate this. Why does this matter? Well, it turns out as soon as the big-headed ants had eaten all the acacia ants, there was nothing to protect the acacia trees, the whistling thorn trees, and so the elephants just had a heyday. And so you went from a savanna that had a fair number of trees situated throughout it to a really pretty bare plane with just one or two trees on it. And if you go to the story online, you'll see pictures of this.\n\nSo the researchers are like, \"Okay, this has happened, but what does that mean?\" Well, it turns out that the lions that live there like to eat zebra. They like to hide in clumps of acacia trees. And when a zebra goes by, they race out and grab it and eat it. But after all the acacia ants got eaten up by the big-headed ants and the elephants came in and they killed many of the acacia trees, there was a lot more open space, and the zebra could see the lions coming, and zebra can outrun lions. So the zebra suddenly became really hard for the lions to kill. So the researchers were then like, \"Well, what happened next?\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So, Beth, what did happen next? What was the end result of these invasive ants?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nThey were surprised to find that the lions did not just go someplace else where there were more zebra and no big-headed ants. Instead, the lions looked around and said, \"Well, what else can we eat?\" The other thing that they could eat is these African buffalo. And the thing about African buffalo is they don't run away because they don't run as fast as zebra do. What they do instead is they basically stand their ground and try and fight back the lions. It does not go well for the African buffalo when they try and fight back the lions.\n\nThese researchers, who were looking at this area, an animal park or an animal conservation area in Kenya, were able to show that the predation of zebras went down by almost half while the predation of African buffalo went from 0 to 42%. So basically, the lions started eating the buffaloes instead of the zebra, which is how the arrival of a tiny, tiny little ant over the course of 20 years ended up with a whole bunch of buffalo dying and zebras living.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nI'm curious, Beth. We're talking about East Africa. What lessons can we take from this when it comes to really the power of invasive species around the world?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nThey can have consequences that you never expect that they will have. But I think the larger lesson that scientists are learning is that ecosystems are these really complicated series of interconnected systems. And if you take out one thing, it's like playing Jenga with your kids, all these other things can happen that you never would've expected would've happened. And it takes a lot of careful watching to figure out what's going on, but once you see it, you're like, \"That's not good.\" The problem with all invasive species is it's really hard to put the genie back in the bottle.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Elizabeth Weise, we are always smarter after you hop on the show. Thanks so much, Beth.\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nYou're so welcome.\n\n\u2666\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBy the way, today is Groundhog Day, but don't worry, we'll be right back here tomorrow with a fresh set of stories.

He said people should be alert and take steps ahead of time \"for what could be a life-threatening flood.\"\n\nIn a forecast discussion, the weather service said \"with the ground already saturated from today's (Thursday's) rain, onset of dangerous flash flooding will be much quicker with this next event and everyone, especially those near or in south facing mountains, needs to start preparing now for possible evacuations during or even before the storm hits.\"\n\nWhat is the Pineapple Express?\n\nJust like Thursday's storm, Sunday's storm is being referred to as a Pineapple Express, the most well-known nickname for an atmospheric river, which occurs when the source of the moisture is near Hawaii. When a Pineapple Express hits land in the western United States and Canada, it can cause heavy rain and snow. In California, it can cause several inches of rain in a day.\n\nSnow will be measured by the foot\n\nElsewhere, snowfall in the Sierra Nevada will be measured by the foot above 4,000 feet, Weather.com said. \"Significant travel impacts are likely so it's best to delay any driving plans beginning Sunday.\"\n\nThe mountains of Southern California will also see heavy snow. At higher elevations there, \"snowfall totals will likely be measured in feet, rather than inches above 7,000 or 7,500 feet, probably 2 to 4 feet in some areas,\" the weather service said.\n\nGrammys and golf impacted\n\nThe Grammy Awards are scheduled for Sunday evening at 5 p.m. PST at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, according to Deadline. \"That timing coincides with what the weather service expects will be rain of 'very heavy' intensity.\"\n\n\"The red carpet starts much earlier,\" Deadline said. \"Expect umbrellas to be the night\u2019s hottest accessory.\"\n\nAnd up the coast in Pebble Beach, the final round of this week's PGA tour event could be in jeopardy. The forecast there Sunday calls for an inch of rain and sustained winds of 25-30 mph, with gusts up to 50 mph, PGATour.com said. Bad weather has plagued the tournament there many times in the past, including last year, when the final round was pushed to Monday due to unplayable conditions on Sunday, according to PGATour.com.\n\nContributing: Dave Mason, The Ventura County Star"}

According to the New York Post, his sister, Myriam Gomes Lopes, spoke with Newsflash about what happened.\n\nGomes cooked the pufferfish and served himself and an unnamed friend, who miraculously survived the deadly meal.\n\nLopes told Newsflash her family doesn't know where the pufferfish, that was gifted to her brother, came from and whether it was caught or farmed.\n\nShe said her brother didn't have any experience cleaning and preparing pufferfish. He and his friend only gutted the fish, removed its liver and then boiled it before eating it with lime juice.\n\nMore stories on poisonings:Missouri teacher accused of trying to poison husband with lily of the valley in smoothie\n\nEffects of eating pufferfish led to man's death\n\nLopes said Gomes felt the effects of the toxins less than an hour after eating the fish.\n\n\"Magno started to feel numb in his mouth,\u201d said Lopes.\n\nGomes drove himself to the hospital, where the toxins began to take over, and the numbness spread through his body before he went into cardiac arrest for 8 minutes.\n\nAccording to Lopes, the man also suffered from multiple seizures that \"greatly affected\" his brain and left him with a small chance of survival\n\nLopes says her brother was then intubated and put on life support. He died 35 days later on January 27, reports the New York Post.\n\n\u201cThe doctors told our family that he died from poisoning, which had quickly traveled to his head,\u201d said Lopes.\n\nHis friend, while still alive, is also experiencing adverse effects from the poison.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not walking very well,\u201d said Lopes. \u201cHe was neurologically impacted, but he is recovering.\u201d\n\nPufferfish: Why the fish is deadly and toxic\n\nAccording to National Geographic, pufferfish are still dangerous, even when they don't puff up and look like deadly, spiked balloons.\n\nThe poison that killed Gomes is called tetrodotoxin. The toxin, which is meant to deter predators from consuming the fish, can be found in almost every single puffer fish, states National Geographic.\n\n\"To humans, tetrodotoxin is deadly, up to 1,200 times more poisonous than cyanide,\" writes the publication. \"There is enough toxin in one pufferfish to kill 30 adult humans, and there is no known antidote.\"\n\nTwenty species of pufferfish reside in Brazil, and over half can be found in Espirito Santa.\n\nOther media outlets did not specify the species of pufferfish that Gomes ate.\n\nDespite the deadly poison, pufferfish is considered to be delicacy\n\nRaw pufferfish is considered to be a delicacy in Japan, where it's known as fogu.\n\nReports vary, but according to Hidden Japan, chefs undergo over three years of training. Knajfi said chefs have to undergo at least two years of training.\n\nHowever, Yutaka Sasaki says that serving fugu requires a much longer apprenticeship.\n\n\"If you want to cook real fogu, you need to serve, at least, a 10-year apprenticeship,\" Sasaki, a fogu specialist with 45 years of experience in the art, told Great Big Story.\n\nScience Direct reports Japan sees around 50 deaths related to puffer fish poisoning yearly.\n\nMost are contributed to inexperienced chefs who prepare the dish themselves, like Gomes."}

Roman also accused Wade of using of some of the more than $650,000 he's been paid to take Willis on trips to California, Florida and Caribbean cruises. Trump and another co-defendant joined the motion late last month.\n\nTrump and Republicans in Georgia and in Congress have seized on the allegations of impropriety to target Willis and her prosecution of the election case.

According to the FDA notice, the foam, which is used to reduce sound and vibration, degrades with use, causing \"black pieces of foam, or certain chemicals that are not visible\" to be \"breathed in or swallowed by the person using the device.\"\n\nPhilips attempted to fix this issue after an initial recall of over five million devices in 2021, but the fixes proved dangerous as well, reportedly blocking the airways of people using them.\n\nPhilips has since come to an agreement with regulators to stop selling these and similar devices in the U.S., and a proposed class action settlement is underway.

During a \"Monday Night Football\" contest Dec. 13, 1971, between Washington and the Los Angeles Rams, Reid was shown participating in a punt, pass and kick competition and towering over his other competition. At the time, Reid was 6-foot-1 and weighed more than 200 pounds.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\n\u201cFor a 12, 13-year-old kid, it was pretty exciting. I didn\u2019t know it was being filmed, just know that. That one was snuck on me a little bit,\" Reid said in 2021. \"There weren\u2019t a lot of 13-year-olds doing that at that time, that I knew, other than the guys in the competition. But it was fun.\u201d\n\nEven though the television caption read \u201cAndy Ried,\" Reid took it all in stride.\n\n\u201cThey had the vowels mixed up,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I leaned toward the English side.\u201d\n\nAndy Reid coaching career\n\nReid's first coaching experience came in 1982 as a graduate assistant at BYU, where he played his college football. He then went on to coach offensive lines at San Francisco State, Northern Arizona, UTEP and Missouri before breaking into the NFL in 1992 when the Green Bay Packers hired him as a tight ends and assistant offensive line coach.\n\nHe was promoted to quarterbacks coach and assistant head coach in 1997 and worked with Hall of Famer Brett Favre for two seasons. Reid also helped guide the Packers to a Super Bowl 31 win.\n\nAndy Reid record with Eagles\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles hired him as head coach in January 1999 and he spent 14 seasons there, compiling a 130-93-1 record, winning six division titles, and making it to the NFC championship game five times. His lone Super Bowl appearance with the team came in Super Bowl 39 in 2005, a 24-21 loss to the New England Patriots.\n\nHis final season with the team was in 2012 as the Eagles finished with a 4-12 record and Reid was fired after the season.

She was questioned by prosecutors on Friday before both sides prepared to deliver closing arguments to the jury.\n\nProsecutors have argued she knew her son Ethan was struggling with alarming mental health issues, including on the day he killed four children at his Michigan high school in November 2021. She and her husband are accused of buying the shooter the gun he used rather than getting him help, and then fleeing afterward.\n\nLegal experts say the case could have huge impact on how society views parents\u2019 culpability when their children access guns and go on to cause harm with them. But whether the outcome encourages prosecutors to bring future charges against parents remains to be seen, two law experts told USA TODAY.\n\n\u201cThis could be a groundbreaking case,\u201d Adam Winkler at the UCLA School of Law said. \u201cThis is a case that could create real incentives for parents to be much more cautious giving their children access to firearms.\u201d\n\nEthan Crumbley, 15 at the time of the shooting, was sentenced in December to life without the possibility of parole plus an additional 24 years.\n\nMom of shooter takes the stand in her own defense\n\nAsked on Thursday by her defense attorney if she felt that she had failed as a parent, as she noted in a message to her ex-lover following the shooting, Jennifer Crumbley said: \"I don't feel that I'm a failure as a parent. But at that point in time, I felt I had failed.\"\n\nCrumbley told jurors that as a parent, she saw her role as being someone who protected her son from harm, not protecting others from him. \"That's what blew my mind ... that my child harmed\" other people, she said, adding: \"I wish he would have killed us instead.\"\n\nProsecutors questioned Crumbley Friday on what they said were inconsistencies in her story, focusing on whether she was fleeing and hiding from law enforcement in early December when she and her husband were arrested after a manhunt.\n\nUnder questioning by the prosecution, she acknowledged there was nothing stopping her from taking her son home on the day of the shooting after being called in to talk with counselors about his mental health.\n\n\u201cAnd on November the 30th of 2021 at 12:51 p.m., you could have been with him,\u201d Assistant Prosecutor Marc Keast said, referring to the time the shooting in the school began.\n\n\u201cI could have, yes,\u201d Crumbley said.\n\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t,\u201d Keast said.\n\nShe said no.\n\nIn an average criminal trial, a defendant would not usually testify, Winkler said: \u201cIt\u2019s Criminal Law 101. You do not allow the defendant to take the stand, it doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re innocent or they\u2019re guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the last act of a desperate defense,\u201d Winkler said about putting the defendant on the stand.\n\nUniversity of Michigan law professor Frank Vandervort, however, said he wasn\u2019t surprised the defense chose to put Crumbley on the stand, and said it was likely to gain sympathy from the jurors.\n\n\u201cI think the jury almost needs to hear from her,\u201d Vandervort said. \u201cI think the jury is going to want to know, \u2018How does she explain these things?\u2019\u201d\n\nHas there ever been a case like this before?\n\nWhether the Crumbley parents are convicted or acquitted, the case could have broad implications because of the unique and extreme factors involved, and the rare legal theory of holding parents accountable for their children\u2019s violent actions.\n\nWinkler said whether to charge parents and what to charge them with is a very difficult decision for prosecutors to make. Parents of shooters also suffer greatly after these tragedies, he said, and it can be very difficult to prove a direct line between parents\u2019 actions (or lack thereof) and their child\u2019s actions. If parents\u2019 behavior doesn\u2019t seem especially \u201cblameworthy,\u201d it can be especially difficult in more gun-friendly states where children regularly partake in activities like hunting with parents, Winkler said.\n\nParents have done jail time before when their children have gotten their hands on guns and shot people, but they have usually been for lesser charges. Vandervort noted two other examples: The mother of a 6-year-old who shot his teacher in Newport News, Virginia, last year was sentenced for child neglect and firearms offenses; and the father of the adult gunman in the deadly 2022 Fourth of July parade shooting in Illinois served time for sponsoring a firearm application for his son.\n\nNotably also in Michigan, a man who lived in the same house as a 6-year-old boy who shot and killed classmate Kayla Rolland in 2000 was charged and pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter for leaving the gun accessible to the child in a shoebox. Much different circumstances than the Crumbley case, Vandervort said.\n\n\u201cThat we have to go back 20 years to find a similar case exemplifies how really unusual this case is,\u201d Vandervort said.\n\nHow does the outcome of this trial impact future cases?\n\nProsecutors have said the \u201cegregious\u201d aspects of the case include the clear signs the shooter was in mental distress leading up to the shooting and that his parents ignored it. They claimed the shooter should have been taken for immediate treatment the morning of the shooting when his parents were called into school to discuss troubling drawings and statements he had written on a math assignment.\n\nBut the parents did not want to. Prosecutors also said the parents bought the murder weapon as a gift for their son days before the shooting instead of getting him treatment.\n\nThose are all extreme factors, Winkler and Vandervort agreed. The two were split on whether they thought the Crumbley parents\u2019 trials could have future legal implications such as encouraging prosecutors to bring charges against the parents of future mass shooters.\n\nWinkler thought that was certainly possible, but acknowledged that while there will likely be future school shootings under similar circumstances, the evidence may not be as strong as in the Crumbley case.\n\n\u201cI think this case could be a landmark precedent that encourages more criminal charges against the parents of school shooters,\u201d Winkler said.\n\nVandervort thought there would be very few future cases quite like this, and said it\u2019s a very legally difficult case to argue despite the extreme circumstances. But regardless of the verdict, he said the local community would feel a sense of justice after hearing all the facts come out.\n\nAnd either way, the fact that two parents were charged with involuntary manslaughter for the four lives their son took with the gun they bought him should send a strong message that parents must be extremely cautious with guns in the home.\n\n\u201cThis could be a turning point, if there\u2019s a conviction, where we see more attention being paid to parents of school shooters, and there may be some good in that,\u201d Winkler said.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s sad because the parents have suffered a great loss too. On the other hand, we live in a very heavily armed society. We need to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. And that\u2019s going to rely on each and every gun owner to do their part to keep their firearms secure and not provide firearms to people who can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d"}

But the next time 2008 OS7 comes back our way, it will be a much more distant encounter of 45 million miles away.\n\nThe flyby was one of four near-Earth asteroids NASA anticipated would harmlessly cruise by Earth on Friday. However, the other three asteroids are much smaller, with the largest being just 70 feet across.\n\nSince NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies began detecting asteroids, the agency has discovered 32,412 through Aug. 31. It's estimated that another 14,050 asteroids at least 460 feet in length are waiting to be discovered.\n\nHow to watch the asteroid fly near Earth\n\nThe asteroid was much too small and far away to see without a telescope.\n\nBut those who want to catch a glimpse of the asteroid, even if it's virtual, still have their chance. The Virtual Telescope Project streamed the event live on YouTube.\n\nThe video, which remains available, allows viewers to distinguish 2008 OS7 as a tiny dot moving past stars that appear as even tinier dots in the background.\n\nHere's where to watch it:\n\nWhat are 'potentially hazardous' asteroids?\n\nThe asteroid 2008 OS7 is large enough for NASA to deem it as \"potentially hazardous\" space object.\n\nThe JPL lab, which the California Institute of Technology manages on behalf of NASA, tracks any asteroids or comets with orbits that will bring them within 4.6 million miles of Earth, or 19.5 times the distance to the moon. Its Asteroid Watch dashboard displays the date of the next five closest approaches, as well as each object's approximate diameter and its distance from Earth.\n\nAny object larger than about 150 meters (about 492 feet) that can approach the Earth to within this distance becomes potentially hazardous, according to the lab.\n\nMost asteroids orbit within the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. But some follow paths that circulate into the inner solar system, including so-called near-Earth asteroids, according to NASA.\n\nWhat is NASA doing to protect Earth from asteroids?\n\nWithin the last few years, NASA has taken steps to protect humanity from threats posed by not only asteroids, but also other inbound objects, such as comets.\n\nThe Planetary Defense Coordination Office was established in 2016 to catalogue near-Earth objects that could crash into the planet in order to help the U.S. government prepare for efforts to mitigate or deflect potential threats. About a year ago, NASA successfully crashed a spacecraft into an asteroid known as Dimorphos, adjusting its speed and path as the first test mission for the agency's Double Asteroid Redirection Test.\n\nBut typically, planetary defense experts prefer nudging threatening objects out of the way rather than obliterating them in order to avoid a blown-up space rock from raining down in multiple pieces onto Earth.\n\nNASA is also working on an asteroid-hunting telescope known as the NEO Surveyor to find near-Earth objects capable of causing significant damage. Set to launch no earlier than June 2028, the telescope is designed to discover 90% of asteroids and comets that are 460 feet in size or larger and come within 30 million miles of Earth\u2019s orbit.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

ArrowRight And, at the center, a prominent Republican figure whose fiery rhetoric acts as a magnet.\n\nRight-wing extremists are dusting off the blueprint for the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol and using it to rally support for their cause du jour: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s showdown with the federal government over border enforcement. Monitoring groups warn that Abbott\u2019s posturing, like Trump\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d effort, heightens the risk of political violence as supporters converge on Eagle Pass, a frontier outpost of 28,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSummed up by one observer as \u201cslow-motion secession,\u201d the unrest in Texas is a case study in how once-fringe ideologies have been laundered into mainstream Republican politics.\n\nOn Friday, Abbott posted on social media that Texas \u201cwill not back down.\u201d For weeks, his statements have included menacing-sounding messages saying that he\u2019s \u201cdeclared an invasion,\u201d and would use \u201cunprecedented action\u201d to stop illegal crossings.\n\nCivil rights group were outraged when Abbott, asked by a radio interviewer about the maximum pressure he could use at the border, replied: \u201cThe only thing that we\u2019re not doing is we\u2019re not shooting people who come across the border, because of course, the Biden administration would charge us with murder.\u201d\n\nExtremism researchers warn that Abbott\u2019s stand against federal orders is communicated in language that glorifies vigilantism and promotes white supremacist talking points, the latest example of the GOP\u2019s hard-right swing in the Trump era.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis rhetoric, combined with Texas\u2019s standoff with the federal government, is applauded by the same far-right movements that engage in hate crimes, domestic terrorism and were prominent at the January 6 insurrection,\u201d said Heidi Beirich of the nonprofit Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. \u201cAll of this should give us pause.\u201d\n\nAbbott\u2019s rebellion began last month when he seized control of Shelby Park in Eagle Pass, on the banks of the Rio Grande, and shut out U.S. Border Patrol agents who had long used the area as a staging point. Supporters praised him for taking a stand against illegal crossings they describe as at \u201cinvasion\u201d levels. Detractors viewed the move as inhumane and a dangerous overreach of state power.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ordered Abbott to allow Border Patrol to remove or cut razor wire barriers that prevent agents from reaching the river to help migrants in distress. Instead, Abbott is installing more wire, his defiance backed by 25 Republican governors who signed a letter of support. Trump, who is sailing toward the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, also boosted Abbott, writing on Truth Social that Texas \u201cmust be given full support to repel the invasion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbbott and other GOP leaders use the same tropes about migrants as white-power groups and frequently echo the racist \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d which imagines the engineered replacement of White people in western societies. Hate trackers say violent movements have wasted little time in seizing on the political opening.\n\nBeirich said her center\u2019s research team has \u201cdocumented an online explosion of invasion and great replacement rhetoric\u201d related to Texas and has observed how white supremacists, Proud Boys and other extremist groups are \u201ctaking advantage of the standoff to push their propaganda and recruit new members.\u201d\n\nTexas Proud Boys factions have shared posts referring to \u201cbrown immigrant invaders\u201d and urging followers to \u201cgrab your guns.\u201d Beirich said a neo-Nazi network issued a rallying cry \u201casking for White men to join the resistance\u201d in Texas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConcerns this weekend are focused on a \u201cTake Back Our Border\u201d caravan of right-wing activists \u2014 billing themselves as \u201cGod\u2019s army\u201d \u2014 heading to Texas before planned stops in other states along the southern border. Organized mainly online, the convoy is what extremism researchers see as a microcosm of the modern-day American right: angry at the federal government, hostile toward marginalized groups, and tolerant of violent rhetoric about political enemies.\n\nDevin Burghart of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, a nonprofit focused on threats to democracy, traced the paramilitary connections of convoy organizers, linking them to movements that took up arms in previous standoffs with the federal government or had a role in the Capitol attack.\n\n\u201cFrom the convoy\u2019s steering committee on down, the protest comprises many of the same dangerous elements as the January 6 insurrection,\u201d Burghart said, referring to far-right umbrella movements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe convoy left from Virginia Beach, Va., on Monday in what Vice News, which is closely monitoring the movement, described as \u201ca sad start\u201d of just a couple dozen vehicles, nowhere near the 700,000 figure some participants had touted. Momentum has since picked up, however, with 100 or more vehicles joining as the caravan headed southwest to Texas.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many people will join Abbott\u2019s showdown over the next couple of days.

Participants have been asked not to bring long guns, for example, though sidearms are fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnson Bills, a convoy organizer affiliated with Cornerstone Children\u2019s Ranch in Quemado, Tex., a nonprofit hosting one of the weekend events, said he met with \u201cextremely welcoming\u201d officials from the Texas Department of Public Safety and provided them with a list of more than a dozen individuals and groups that were banned from the convoy and who, if they show up, will be removed by security.\n\nSince the Jan. 6 prosecutions, Bills said, \u201cpeople have been scared\u201d to stage big rallies. This moment, he said, offers the chance for a relaunch with a focus on border enforcement, a unifying point for the right.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d said Bills, speaking Thursday afternoon at the ranch, where preparations were underway for the convoy arrival.\n\nAt the compound\u2019s front gate Thursday afternoon, a white-haired guitarist played the \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic\u201d to welcome guests. American, Israeli and Christian flags hung on three poles. Posters bearing Bible verses and patriotic messaging hung from the colorful walls. Sloppy joes and hot dogs were on the menu; bottles of iced tea were stacked near the back of the room. A fully stocked medical bay boasted a stretcher-like bed and first-aid supplies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPointing to the grassy spot where a stage will be erected for speakers and preachers, Bills said he envisioned the event as a \u201crevival.\u201d\n\nThe caravan expected Friday has grown to 5 miles long, he said. Organizers obtained a permit for convoy truckers to park their vehicles along a country road next to an irrigation canal that supplies water to the surrounding farms and ranches.\n\nSince 2021, Bills, also a Republican Party official in Uvalde County, has used the Cornerstone Children\u2019s camp as a base for freelance \u201csecurity services\u201d offered to residents living along a busy river crossing point about 20 miles northwest of Eagle Pass.\n\nThere, Bills said, he and other volunteers solicit permission from landowners to patrol river-adjacent properties that routinely fall victim to break-ins and car thefts. They \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d left open by law enforcement. He calls it a civilian patrol; extremism monitors call it an example of right-wing paramilitary groups appointing themselves border security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBills drew distinctions between the volunteers he works with and other militia-style formations, saying they\u2019re not \u201crunning around with long rifles and camouflage,\u201d and make sure to pass on tips to law enforcement agencies.\n\n\u201cI see this as a humanitarian mission,\u201d Bills said. \u201cAnd a constitutional one.\u201d\n\nBut some militia-style factions that support Abbott\u2019s stand in principle are staying away from the rallies and are encouraging other groups to do the same.\n\nSam Hall, leader of the Texas-based Patriots for America militia group, cited Jan. 6 as a cautionary tale about what can happen when \u201ca few bad actors\u201d take over an otherwise peaceful rally. Speaking in a Facebook live video, Hall said violence this weekend would \u201chand the Biden regime the narrative they so desperately want\u201d in an election year.\n\n\u201cIf that powder keg explodes, it\u2019s going to explode right in the face of the right,\u201d Hall warned.\n\nFearing an influx of anti-immigrant protesters, some Latino rights groups are recommending security precautions to local communities. Citing Abbott\u2019s \u201cinciteful political rhetoric,\u201d the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the nation\u2019s oldest Hispanic civil rights group, urged members in Texas to \u201cbe on alert for armed out-of-state extremists with a hate agenda.\u201d\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar (D-Tex.) represents El Paso, where the threat of hate-fueled violence is not hypothetical.

The cause is a particularly intense atmospheric river that will aim a fire hose of moisture at the coast and run up against the region\u2019s mountainous terrain.\n\nThe potential for flooding is highest from around Santa Barbara to the south. Strong winds, mountain snow and dangerously high surf are also a concern, with storm impacts expected to reach as far north as the Bay Area.\n\nThe Weather Service office serving the Los Angeles region is cautioning that the expected torrents could trigger rock and mudslides in the mountains, and flooding of small streams, rivers and roadways throughout the region. Burn scars left behind by wildfires will be particularly prone to flooding and debris flows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople need to start preparing now for a major flooding event,\u201d the Weather Service wrote in a discussion Friday.\n\nThe potential for flooding comes just days after another atmospheric river dumped several inches of rain across portions of the state, including record daily amounts in southwest California.\n\nThe storm is still a few days away, so precipitation estimates are still coming into focus; some recent model projections backed off forecasts that were considered extreme. But many foothill and mountain areas could see 6 to 12 inches or more of rain. Santa Barbara, a coastal city with steep mountains behind it, could see 10 to 15 inches of rain in the higher terrain. Such amounts have caused \u201cmajor\u201d problems in the past, the Weather Service said.\n\n\u201cBetween the tremendous amount of moisture that this storm has with it, good southerly flow and slow movement \u2014 those are all the ingredients for some of our biggest storms,\u201d said David Bruno, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Oxnard, Calif. \u201cBut I want to stop short of saying that this is going to be something we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDowntown Los Angeles is most likely to see 3 to 5 inches of rain, which wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented for a two-day period. \u201cHowever, if we start talking 6 or 7 inches of rain in two days, then we\u2019re close to the top few events ever,\u201d Bruno said.\n\nThe Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes, based in La Jolla, Calif., predicts the atmospheric river will reach category 3 on its 1-to-5 scale, with 5 being the most extreme. The scale defines a category 3 atmospheric river as \u201cstrong\u201d and producing a \u201cbalance of beneficial and hazardous impacts,\u201d including the threat of flooding but also helping to refill reservoirs. A Category 3 is considered by meteorologists to be on the higher end of atmospheric rivers that hit Southern California.\n\nDownpours will be fueled by unusually warm waters off the California coast, intensified by the El Ni\u00f1o climate pattern. Sea surface temperatures are much as 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit above normal.\n\n\u201cThis warm ocean increases amount of moisture in lower levels of atmosphere (& thus in storms) due to increased evaporation, and may also be contributing to apparent propensity for extreme hourly t-storm downpours this year,\u201d Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles, wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe forecast for Southern California\n\nRain chances increase late Saturday afternoon and evening in Southern California, with the heaviest rain and highest risk for widespread flooding of roads, streams and rivers anticipated late Saturday night through Sunday night in Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo counties, and Sunday night into Monday in Los Angeles County. Strong and damaging winds from the southeast could cause power outages, while travel delays and road closures are likely because of heavy mountain snow and possibly mudslides.\n\nParticularly heavy rain is likely on and below the south side of mountain ranges such as the Santa Ynez and Topatoga ranges. Rainfall rates of a half-inch per hour could last for many hours with up to one inch per hour possible on and below south-facing slopes. There\u2019s also a slight chance for thunderstorms in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties.\n\nThe exact timing of the heaviest rain in Los Angeles County, how long it will last and ultimately how much will fall are uncertain because models indicate the storm\u2019s plume of moisture could temporarily stall over Santa Barbara and Ventura counties Sunday into Sunday night, and there\u2019s some question as to how slow or fast it will advance through Los Angeles county once it starts moving again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Weather Service is predicting an average of 3 to 6 inches in most coastal and valley areas through Monday, 6 to 12 inches in the foothills and mountains, and as much as 15 inches across the mountains of southern Santa Barbara and western Ventura counties. Southern Santa Barbara County through western Los Angeles County has the best chance of seeing rainfall totals reaching the upper end of the forecast ranges, especially if the moisture plume slows or stalls there.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe rainfall will come after calendar rainfall records were set Thursday at several locations in southwest California, including 2.93 inches at Santa Barbara, 2.49 inches at Los Angeles and 2.45 inches at Long Beach.\n\nFloodwaters submerged residential areas of Los Angeles County on Feb. 1 as an atmospheric river brought heavy rain to the area.

For San Diego and western Riverside counties, which experienced serious flooding about 10 days ago, additional rainfall of 2 to 3 inches is possible near the coast and 3 to 5 inches in the mountains and 0.5 to 1 inch in the lower deserts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe storm will also bring strong winds, moderate coastal flooding and dangerous surf and rip currents. Winds along the coast could reach or surpass 50 mph Sunday and Monday. Surf heights are forecast to 8 to 12 feet south of Point Conception, the Weather Service said. In the mountains, winds could top 60 mph.\n\nThe forecast for the Bay Area and Central Coast\n\nFlood watches are up for the Bay Area and Central Coast late Saturday afternoon into Monday morning after many locations recorded 4 to 5 inches of rain Wednesday into early Thursday. The Weather Service is warning of flooding on creeks, streams and rivers, and in urban and low-lying areas.\n\nRain should increase Saturday evening along the Big Sur coast before spreading north and east through Saturday night. The heaviest rain arrives early Sunday with highest amounts through Monday expected along the Central Coast at Big Sur and the Santa Lucias, where rainfall could reach 5 to 7 inches. Lesser amounts around 2 to 3 inches are forecast around San Francisco and Oakland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA high wind warning has been issued for Sunday for the San Francisco Peninsula Coast, Santa Cruz Mountains, Eastern Santa Clara Hills, East Bay Hills and Northern Monterey Bay because of the potential for gusts up to 60 mph that could blow down trees and power lines. In some areas, especially southern zones, the winds could be stronger than the previous storm.\n\nHeavy mountain snow could fend off drought threat\n\nWhile most storms this winter have targeted coastal California, the upcoming atmospheric river could also deliver 2 to 4 feet of snow to the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada \u2014 a welcome change given that precipitation has been lagging behind in this key region for the California\u2019s water supply. Statewide snowpack is only about half of where it should be this time of year, though it has improved this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the deficits, the latest federal Drought Monitor placed a swath of the Sierra Nevada in the \u201cabnormally dry\u201d category, which can be a precursor to drought.\n\nHowever, California\u2019s reservoirs are still above average and flush with water because of last year\u2019s record-breaking snowy winter. In fact, some reservoirs are releasing water for flood protection ahead of this week\u2019s storms.\n\n\u201cEven though this winter has provided below average precipitation overall, it can only take one storm to produce severe flooding in the right circumstances,\u201d the California Department of Water Resources said in a statement this week. \u201cCommunities in San Diego, the Bay Area and along the North Coast have already experienced flooding impacts this winter, highlighting the need to always be prepared for flood risk.\u201d"}

Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) undoubtedly knows this. He even backed off a bipartisan immigration deal before \u2014 in 2018 \u2014 dealing it a critical blow.\n\nBut as Lankford has increasingly become an outcast in certain Trump-oriented corners of the Republican Party for trying to forge a border security deal with Democrats, he\u2019s not exactly shying away from the fight.\n\nRepeatedly in recent days, Lankford has taken on critics directly. He has suggested that his own conservative allies are spreading misinformation about the deal (whose text has yet to be released). He\u2019s effectively accused them of choosing political expediency and presidential campaign politics over border security. And significantly, he\u2019s had some backup from other Senate Republicans.\n\nIt appears unlikely that the deal will ultimately become law; even if it passes in the Senate, its prospects in the House appear dim. But as hopes for it have dwindled, Lankford has doubled down on spending his political capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt seemed to begin, quietly, in a mid-January post on X.\n\n\u201cOnly in Washington is our southern border political gamesmanship instead of a national security crisis,\u201d he said, as the right wing started ramping up its opposition.\n\nOnly in Washington is our southern border political gamesmanship instead of a national security crisis. \u2014 Sen. James Lankford (@SenatorLankford) January 17, 2024\n\nLankford over the weekend seemed to expound on his meaning. He suggested that Republicans were flip-flopping and prioritizing Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 election hopes \u2014 and there\u2019s evidence for this contention.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting: Republicans, four months ago, would not give funding for Ukraine, for Israel and for our southern border because we demanded changes in policy,\u201d Lankford said on CNN.\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s interesting, a few months later, when we\u2019re finally getting to the end, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, just kidding, I actually don\u2019t want a change in law because it\u2019s a presidential election year.\u2019\u201d\n\nLankford has rejected GOP claims that all that\u2019s needed is to have a president like Trump with the will to secure the border. He has noted that even Trump as president emphasized the need for legislation to change things like asylum laws \u2014 as his proposal would.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about opposition from the likes of Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), Lankford has repeatedly suggested that they are relying on misinformation.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAsked Sunday on CBS News about Trump\u2019s opposition, Lankford said he looked forward to Trump actually being able to read the bill and quickly invoked the \u201cmisinformation\u201d label.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there right now. \u2026 I hear this comment that it waves in 5,000 people, it hands out work permits, that \u2014 all those things are not true,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of internet rumors that are running around on this right now.\u201d\n\nPunchbowl News reported Thursday that Lankford said his office had repeatedly reached out to Johnson about Johnson\u2019s comments invoking the 5,000 number. (Johnson\u2019s office said Lankford\u2019s office hasn\u2019t been forthcoming with details.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Trump and Johnson have claimed that the deal would allow 5,000 undocumented immigrants per day. In fact, that\u2019s merely the threshold at which a president would be compelled to shut down the border. \u201cThis is not someone standing at the border with a little clicker and saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to let one more in; we\u2019re at 4,999 and then it has to stop,\u2019\u201d Lankford told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nNegotiators have said those detained at the border would no longer be released into the country while they await immigration hearings; asylum claims would have to be decided within 15 days for those who don\u2019t cross at a port of entry.\n\nLankford told Punchbowl: \u201cI\u2019m not confident anyone who has been attacking it \u2026 will come out and speak to y\u2019all and say, \u2018Hey, I was wrong.\u2019 None of those folks are going to look at it and come to the press and apologize. They\u2019ll find something different.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added some particularly pointed comments suggesting that his colleagues were grandstanding.\n\n\u201cFor any of my colleagues that want to do this, go do the work on it,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cBut don\u2019t just do a news conference. Actually sit down with the other side and figure out what we can actually resolve.\u201d\n\nPrecisely what the endgame is here is a valid question. The deal seems to have little hope in a House in which the speaker must constantly mind his right flank. Trump holds considerable sway; congressional Republicans don\u2019t always abide by his wishes, but election-year politics loom large, and immigration is a pretty big issue on which to break with him.\n\nWe\u2019ve also seen before how this can pan out. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in 2013 joined the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d and took to conservative media to make a case for the deal. Then he wavered on the final product, and he ultimately effectively disowned the effort after the bill passed in the Senate. (It soon died in the House.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf this time is to be different, it has a few things working for it. One is that the deal doesn\u2019t include redline proposals for conservatives like a pathway to citizenship (the focal point of the 2013 effort) or protecting the children of undocumented immigrants, or \u201cdreamers\u201d (as the deal Lankford worked on in 2018 would have).\n\nLankford also isn\u2019t the only one who continues to defend and push the effort. So too have the top two Senate Republicans and the likes of Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). Many of them have made principled cases, like Lankford, that this a conservative proposal and that the problem is too significant to bow to Trump\u2019s wishes."}

Alert: Beginning Feb. 7 and then every other Wednesday, subscribers will get a second newsletter from me. In the new Mail Bag Newsletter, I will answer at greater length a selection of reader questions, pick a media standout (good or bad) and highlight an important ruling or argument in one of Trump\u2019s many trials.\n\nWhat caught my eye\n\nAcross time and geography, people respond to totalitarian threats in similar ways. Some people collaborate; others resist. And still others accommodate authoritarians, trying to keep their heads down to avoid an existential choice.\n\nAs Anne Applebaum eloquently put it in her 2020 essay in the Atlantic on collaborators:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo the American reader, references to Vichy France, East Germany, fascists, and Communists may seem over-the-top, even ludicrous. But dig a little deeper, and the analogy makes sense. The point is not to compare Trump to Hitler or Stalin; the point is to compare the experiences of high-ranking members of the American Republican Party, especially those who work most closely with the White House, to the experiences of Frenchmen in 1940, or of East Germans in 1945, or of Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz in 1947.\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s assault on democracy, we should identify which Republicans chose which category and what consequences flow from their choices.\n\nFollow this author Jennifer Rubin 's opinions Follow\n\nCollaboration: Local snitches, propagandists and eager Nazi party joiners helped implement oppression in occupied Europe during World War II. Today, collaborators wear red hats, not black-and-red arm bands. They parrot racist slogans, stir xenophobia, attack law enforcement, incite violence, condone their leader\u2019s cruelty, spread conspiracies and conceal Trump\u2019s mental disintegration. They have given up on the United States\u2019 quest to become a more perfect union.\n\nClose Trump cronies (e.g., Stephen Miller, Mark Meadows) and the mid-level officials (many of whom joined to gain proximity to power) whose presence shrouded the administration in a thin veil of normality chose collaboration. Cable news apologists (some adjudicated liars), MAGA lawmakers (from Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida to former speaker Kevin McCarthy of California to Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas) and right-wing radio hosts afraid of losing their audience also went down this path. Governors, such as Texas\u2019s Greg Abbott, who openly defy court rulings and spur voter suppression efforts adopt collaboration \u2014 as do state legislators who gleefully gerrymander districts and suppress voting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s not forget supposedly sober-minded Republicans who insisted in 2020 that Trump was the safer choice. Add in MAGA donors, campaign aides, the former officials who refused to testify against Trump and once-respectable think tanks turned into propaganda and policy arms for Trumpism. All the GOP major presidential candidates who left the 2024 race, except former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, became collaborators when they endorsed Trump. Collectively, they not only normalize MAGA extremism but demonize those who resist Trump. Collaborators also include the right-wing partisans on the Supreme Court who strip away civil rights, wreck the regulatory state and erode separation of church and state in service of their MAGA patrons.\n\nResistance: Naturally, Democrats opposed Trump and Trumpism. Republicans did not face imprisonment or death for standing up to Trump. It wasn\u2019t that hard to put up a fight. And yet, Republican resisters remained pathetically scarce. The few holdouts certainly stand out: Never Trump Republicans (and their media outlets), Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) and former Republican members of Congress Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.).\n\nThey broke from their \u201ctribe,\u201d suffered ostracism and, in some cases, lost their jobs because they persistently denounced MAGA\u2019s attacks on democracy and truth. Some former Trump aides (e.g., Cassidy Hutchinson), former state representatives (e.g., Arizona\u2019s Russell \u201cRusty\u201d Bowers) and lawyers from \u201cteam normal\u201d (who willingly told their story to the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021) all resisted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndividual motives might have varied. But a common pattern emerges: Resisters refused to put personal ambition above love of country. They entered politics with a code of conduct grounded in religious belief, patriotism or family heritage. Had they joined Trump, they would not have been able to sleep at night or explain themselves to their children and grandchildren.\n\nAccommodation: Dictatorial regimes succeed not just by roping in enthusiastic collaborators. Without the equivocators and the moral relativists who try to stay out of their era\u2019s overriding moral choice, evil regimes would falter. In that regard, many ex-Trump advisers remain mum about his unfitness. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) voted not to impeach for the insurrection (and hence encouraged others not to break ranks), and GOP lawmakers frequently pretend they missed Trump\u2019s latest tweet to avoid criticizing him.\n\n\u201cWhen challenged, they speak up only long enough to make excuses for Trump and engage in moral obfuscation over issues that they must certainly know are not remotely complicated,\u201d the Atlantic\u2019s Tom Nichols wrote. They thereby \u201ccreate a permission structure for Trump supporters, to model how a reasonable person can dismiss Trump\u2019s astounding disregard for the law and even for basic decency and yet still vote for him and other GOP candidates in the name of some greater good\u201d (e.g., preventing \u201csocialists\u201d from ruining America).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the American Israel Public Affairs Committee backs any official (including election deniers) who follows its lead on Israel and business leaders insist they like Trump\u2019s policies (or make donations to both sides to cover their bets), they make betrayal of democracy acceptable. The most dangerous form of accommodation: No Labels and fringe candidates lure voters from the only candidate who can beat Trump (President Biden) while falsely denying they are spoilers for Trump.\n\nAccommodators who think they can avoid history\u2019s harsh judgment might consider how \u201cmoderate\u201d White ministers whom the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. condemned in his \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail\u201d were regarded. History scorns moral cowards for enabling evil. Trump accommodators will fare no better.\n\nDistinguished people of the week\n\nE. Jean Carroll\u2019s lawyer Roberta Kaplan said in a statement after a $83.3 million verdict against Trump: \u201cThere is a way to stand up to someone like Donald Trump, who cares more about wealth, fame and power than respecting the law. Standing up to a bully takes courage and bravery; it takes someone like E. Jean Carroll. We thank the jury for standing up for E. Jean and the rule of law.\u201d Carroll\u2019s tenacity, courage and dignity forced Trump, for the first time since he was elected president, to pay for his conduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKaplan\u2019s magnificent lawyering, a judge who refused to let Trump unleash chaos in the courtroom and nine conscientious jurors all played their part. Juries in two separate trials have now lowered the boom on Trump. (The first adjudicated, in normal parlance, that Trump raped her and maliciously lied about it.)\n\nMany countries have dispensed with civil jury trials. But in the United States, regular citizens decide the facts and render verdicts. And thank goodness nine decent Americans fulfilled their public obligation to serve and render a just, fair and decisive verdict against Trump. These are model citizens.\n\nSomething different\n\nFrom her iconic \u201cMigrant Mother,\u201d which symbolized dispossessed, downtrodden and destitute refugees from the Dust Bowl, to her images of Black sharecroppers in the South, photojournalist Dorothea Lange portrayed Americans in poverty and despair. \u201cDorothea Lange: Seeing People\u201d at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., exhibits a smattering of her works from the Depression, World War II and beyond. In particular, her Depression-era images of weather-beaten figures, caked in dirt and dressed in tattered clothes, have lost none of their power to illuminate the toll of rural poverty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer artistry provokes questions: How did human beings survive such conditions? How did Americans allow people to live in such conditions? You come away convinced that if not for the New Deal, desperate Americans might have fallen under 20th-century despots\u2019 spell. This illuminating and haunting exhibit deserves attention.\n\nFrom my weekly Q&A\n\nEvery other Wednesday at noon, I host a live Q&A with readers. Read a transcript of this week\u2019s Q&A, or submit a question for the next one. Any questions received after Feb. 7 will be directed to my new Wednesday newsletter.\n\ntimmwood: What is former president Donald Trump thinking? Or is he thinking? Trump wants absolute immunity from any crime he might have committed as president. Has it not occurred to him that if he were to succeed, then President Biden also would have absolute immunity from any crime he might commit? Also, by trying to scuttle the border legislation, isn\u2019t Trump giving Biden the right to say that Biden supported immigration reform while Trump opposed it? Finally, is it arrogance, stupidity or both that leads Trump to frequently insult Judge Arthur Engoron, who could shut down his businesses in New York and make him pay $370 million?"}

Ten years ago, they appeared around the necks of famous statues in Ottawa on a chilly January day. Each scarf was tagged with a note that read: \u201cI am not lost! If you are stuck out in the cold, take this scarf to keep warm.\u201d It was later revealed that a few university students were behind the good deed.\n\nThe incident went viral, and is part of a movement now known as \u201cscarf bombing\u201d \u2014 leaving handmade scarves in public places to warm people up during the winter months. The scarves are typically tied around fences, benches and railings, and are especially intended to support those experiencing homelessness.\n\nWhile the Ottawa scarf bombing was the first to go big online, the phenomenon had already arrived in other places, including Winnipeg.\n\nThe scarf bombing movement has spread across Canada and the United States \u2014 including in Maryland, Virginia, Iowa, New York City, the Twin Cities and Jacksonville, Fla.\n\n\u201cMost of us are doing it because that one person did,\u201d said Michelle Chance-Sangthong, who saw the Ottawa story online in 2014 and started scarf bombing in Jacksonville. She created a Facebook group called Scarf Bomb Jax and has recruited dozens of volunteers over the past decade. They range in age from their teens to their 80s.\n\nAlthough Jacksonville has comparatively warm winters, temperatures can dip into the mid 40s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is a misconception that it\u2019s not cold here,\u201d said Chance-Sangthong, 56. \u201cIf you\u2019re sleeping outside, it is.\u201d\n\nThroughout the winter, Chance-Sangthong and a group of volunteers regularly do scarf bombs (they also leave out hats, gloves, jackets and blankets), in areas with the greatest need. Most of the items they distribute are handmade.\n\nSo far this season, they have done 15 scarf bombs and have donated more than 1,600 pieces of warm clothing.\n\n\u201cI am still blown away and amazed by all the work people put into making this possible,\u201d Chance-Sangthong said.\n\nSuzanne Volpe feels the same way about her own group of dedicated volunteers. A friend of hers in New London, Conn., started scarf bombing in her community in 2014, and as a crochet enthusiast, \u201cI said, \u2018Gee, somebody should do that here.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI took up the challenge,\u201d said Volpe, 71, who lives in Pittsburgh.\n\nShe started a Facebook group called Scarf Bombardiers, which has more than 1,700 members. People often donate yarn, and about 20 regular volunteers crochet scarves for strangers year-round. Throughout the winter, they regularly drop them off in various spots around the city on frigid days. They leave tags on them that say: \u201cCold? Take this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try to put them where there\u2019s foot traffic,\u201d said Volpe, adding that the scarves are usually taken in less than 24 hours.\n\nVolpe \u2014 who always keeps a bag of scarves in her car in case she spots someone in need \u2014 has enjoyed watching her project evolve over the years.\n\n\u201cI get more and more people involved every year, which is great,\u201d said Volpe, who is retired. \u201cI just love every part of it. I love making them; I love putting them out, and I love getting the responses.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIn addition to providing some warmth, Volpe said, the handmade scarves serve as a needed reminder to people that \u201csomebody cares about them.\u201d\n\nVolpe is always delighted to hear of other scarf bombing efforts elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI love seeing it spread,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother group based in Lancaster, Pa., for instance, scarf bombs monthly during the winter.\n\n\u201cI worked for almost a decade in drug and alcohol treatment, so I was aware of people in need,\u201d said Angelia Reed, 52, who led her first scarf bomb in 2015.\n\nShe started an organization called The Wrap Up Project, which collects donations of handmade scarves. Reed and a growing group of volunteers distribute them in Lancaster and Columbia, Pa.\n\n\u201cKnitters and crocheters love to make things for people who need them and will use them,\u201d Reed said.\n\nMichelle Christensen, who lives in Golden Valley, Minn., has been keeping the Twin Cities stocked with scarves since 2016.\n\nIt began after she decided to collect her old winter gear to bring to local shelters and wrote a Facebook post asking if anyone wanted to contribute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt completely blew up,\u201d said Christensen, 53, noting that she collected 100 bags of donations that first year.\n\nShe ended up orchestrating a scarf bomb event. Christensen amassed a crew of volunteers, and they strung the donated clothing around two parks \u2014 one in Saint Paul and one in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cI never expected it to be a thing,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cI was stunned by the response.\u201d\n\nShe then started an organization called One Good Deed, which hosts a good-deed event every month in the Twin Cities. Christensen recently held her seventh consecutive scarf bomb, which is One Good Deed\u2019s flagship event.\n\n\u201cWe started doing it on a smaller scale, and now it\u2019s morphed into a much bigger thing,\u201d she said.\n\nThis season\u2019s scarf bomb was on Jan. 7. Christensen and more than 100 volunteers visited four parks \u2014 two in Saint Paul and two in Minneapolis \u2014 and distributed 535 bags full of scarves, hats, mittens and other winter wear."}

Here\u2019s what to do instead.", "domain": "washingtonpost.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMI7UlAowt9F0", "text": "When one of my patients admitted to telling me a white lie, I wasn\u2019t surprised. As a psychologist, I know that therapy is a place to share your secrets, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to speak the truth. In new relationships, most of us strive to put our best foot forward. Known as \u201cself-presentation,\u201d this tendency can arise whenever we\u2019re worried about being evaluated.\n\nIn therapy, this can lead you to say you\u2019re doing well, even when you\u2019re not. Or to tell your therapist you never use substances, even though you drink or smoke. Other individuals say they are merely stressed even though getting out of bed feels like a chore.\n\nSuch mistruths may sound egregious, but dishonesty in therapy isn\u2019t a terrible act, nor is it rare. For example, one study of over 500 therapy-goers found that over 90 percent of them had lied to their therapist at least once. Top mistruths included pretending to like the therapist\u2019s suggestions, denying feelings of insecurity and minimizing one\u2019s suffering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking with a therapist takes courage, and opening up can feel vulnerable. But skirting the truth comes at a cost. Research shows it can make treatment less effective and drive patients to end therapy too soon.\n\nI told my patient that her fib wasn\u2019t something to be ashamed of \u2014 it was something to understand. We needed to figure out what made honesty challenging to begin with.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a similar situation, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nHere are some common reasons people lie to their therapists and what they can do instead.\n\nFear of being criticized\n\nWhether in therapy or life, we often lie to avoid being criticized.\n\nFor example, I\u2019ve counseled many patients with eating disorders who denied overexercising or restricting what they ate. Other examples include censoring your anger or omitting how often you snap at your children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe tend to pair lying with deception, but these fibs aren\u2019t intended to snow the therapist. Most often, they\u2019re an attempt to avoid judgment.\n\nBut here\u2019s something you should know: A good therapist will never criticize you. Instead, they will help you understand why you fear being judged. For example, family dynamics can play a role. If your caregivers were overly harsh, you may assume everyone will treat you similarly. Or if your parents prized perfection, you may believe anything less is a failure.\n\nFeeling embarrassed\n\nIn one study, over 60 percent of participants said they had lied to avoid embarrassment. For example, if you believe your thoughts, feelings or actions make you \u201cbad\u201d in some way, you\u2019ll be less likely to tell anyone (including your therapist) about it.\n\nBut keep in mind that therapists are like emergency room doctors of mental health. We\u2019ve heard many stories and helped our patients navigate many crises. What feels embarrassing to you won\u2019t upset us. I often temper my patient\u2019s fears by addressing them from the get-go. For example, I say: \u201cIt\u2019s normal to feel embarrassed to tell me things, and that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not here to judge you in any way.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nTrying to please the therapist\n\nPeople-pleasing can cause us to tell \u201caltruistic lies.\u201d These mistruths are meant to protect the other person\u2019s feelings. For instance, you might tell a friend you love their new partner, even if they\u2019re annoying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAltruistic lies are also common in therapy. Years ago, I worked with someone who said therapy was going well. Weeks later, however, they admitted they felt stuck. They had feared that being honest would cause me to dislike them.\n\nMost of us shy away from saying something hurtful, but it\u2019s not your job to protect your therapist\u2019s feelings. Realizing this can be very freeing. Giving your therapist feedback can foster closeness, which makes the truth easier to tell in the future.\n\nTrying to avoid upsetting emotions\n\nOmitting the truth can protect us from upsetting emotions, such as anxiety, guilt or sadness.\n\nThis is common if you have survived trauma, for instance emotional abuse or assault. Or if you\u2019re grieving the loss of a loved one. But avoidance doesn\u2019t make agony disappear.\n\nThe good news is that your therapist can support you with whatever feels challenging. They may even teach you exercises such as deep breathing, which can help you feel calmer.\n\nHow to address the mistruth\n\nIdentify shame. Dishonesty can spark shame and lead you to avoid the problem. Perhaps you never mention the mistruth, which can prevent you from receiving the support you need. One way to outsmart shame is to name it. Start by exploring where it shows up in the body. You may notice a pit in your stomach or tension in your shoulders.\n\nQuiet shame with self-compassion . You can start by telling yourself: \u201cI recognize that we all feel ashamed sometimes. This feeling won\u2019t last forever.\u201d Seeing shame as part of the human experience can make you feel less alone. You can start by telling yourself: \u201cI recognize that we all feel ashamed sometimes. This feeling won\u2019t last forever.\u201d Seeing shame as part of the human experience can make you feel less alone.\n\nEmbrace courage and speak the truth. If you\u2019ve been dishonest, let your therapist know. For example, if you were afraid of being criticized, consider saying: \u201cI wasn\u2019t upfront because I was worried about being judged.\u201d Or if treatment isn\u2019t going well, you might say: \u201cI\u2019d like to be honest about my experience in therapy.\u201d If you\u2019re unsure what prompted the mistruth, saying something like, \u201cI\u2019m not sure why I wasn\u2019t honest,\u201d can help.\n\nWhile telling the truth can be challenging, honesty brings many benefits. It builds trust, which can strengthen the therapeutic relationship. It also provides an opportunity to dig deeper, steering therapy in a more meaningful direction.\n\nJuli Fraga, PsyD, is a psychologist with a private practice in San Francisco."}

Revisions also raised the November job number to 182,000 and also added 117,000 more jobs to December.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see a post-pandemic rebalancing,\u201d said Becky Frankiewicz, president and chief commercial officer of ManpowerGroup. \u201cWhile hiring isn\u2019t as strong as a year ago, it is better than pre-pandemic and has improved month-over-month.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also seeing an expected post-holiday hangover in retail and logistics, balanced by increases in IT, finance, accounting and engineering,\u201d she added. \u201cOverall, more jobs are available now for each unemployed worker than there were before the pandemic, creating a stable environment for employers and employees.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Best Cartoons on the Economy View All 182 Images\n\nThe January number is at odds with other data out this week and reports from job site officials that suggest the labor market is slowing down.\n\nEarlier this week, the government reported that job openings rose slightly at the end of 2023 while private payroll firm ADP saw a sharp decline in the number of new hires in January to 107,000 after December\u2019s downwardly revised 158,000. Weekly unemployment claims, meanwhile, rose last week.\n\n\u201cThe labor market is certainly cooling,\u201d Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, said ahead of the report. \u201cThe question is how much.\u201d\n\nJanuary can be a volatile month for labor data. The government makes annual revisions to prior months and seasonality plays a role. The month is also typically one in which a large number of layoffs are announced as companies report their prior year earnings and plan for the upcoming year.\n\n\u201cI think January is not going to be a good barometer of what\u2019s going to happen over the next 12 months,\u201d says Amy Glaser, senior vice president at Adecco.\n\n\n\nGlaser says hiring has been strong in the health care, hospitality and financial services industries. Health care is benefiting from demand for services aimed at the aging population, she says, while financial services is seeing a seasonal hiring boom related to tax season.\n\nAs for wages, Glaser says they are continuing to increase but that some of the big signing bonuses and incentives that characterized the pandemic-era labor market are gone. \u201cThose massive increases for job hoppers are not happening anymore,\u201d she says.\n\nChris Todd, CEO of hiring technology firm UKG, cautioned against taking too much from one month\u2019s report. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t read too deeply into January\u2019s BLS report,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple of three-day weekends and a variety of storms that impacted parts of the country that aren\u2019t used to dealing with winter storms,\u201d Todd added. \u201cBeing transparent, this makes it hard for everyone, regardless of methodology, to accurately gauge job creation.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, looking at the last couple of months of data together, the outlook remains positive for employees,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are still more jobs than there are people to fill them, yet businesses don\u2019t feel nearly as understaffed as they did a couple of years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWage inflation has cooled like we predicted, but hiring managers are willing to pay top dollar when necessary to fill key roles and attract key skills,\u201d Todd said.\n\nThe latest data will also cause consternation at the Federal Reserve, where policymakers are looking to a cooling of the labor market and a moderation in wage growth are both things the Federal Reserve is looking for before it becomes comfortable with the idea of lowering interest rates. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues held interest rates steady at the highest levels in two decades on Wednesday, but markets do expect the central bank to cut rates later this year.\n\n\u201cI think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing normal, but not totally back to normal,\u201d Powell told reporters. \u201cSo, you know, job openings are not quite back to where they were. Wages, or wage increases rather, are not quite back to where they \u2013 to where they would need to be in the longer run.\u201d\n\nEconomists point out the labor market\u2019s gains have also been concentrated in a few sectors, at least until the January report.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also narrowing,\u201d says Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, adding that \u201c92% of hiring is in just three sectors \u2013 health care, government and hospitality.\u201d\n\nSchutte says the Fed faces a delicate balancing act between acting too soon to cut rates and overheating the economy and waiting until unemployment has risen too much.\n\n\u201cThe risk of overcooling is real,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it is hard to contain the enthusiasm that a strong jobs report along with moderating inflation is good for most Americans."}

For better or for worse, these folks on Reddit and other social media platforms forever changed how Wall Street works.\n\nThe most prominent example of Reddit stocks gone wild was GameStop Corp. (ticker: GME), a firm that has become synonymous with the so-called meme stocks revolution after its meteoric rise in 2021. From trading desks at big investment banks to regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, everyone has learned that it can be perilous to ignore the often cheeky and occasionally ill-informed antics of traders who rely on social media for stock tips.\n\nThe following eight stocks are all making big waves these days, for a variety of reasons. It should go without saying that Reddit stocks shouldn't be traded on a whim and that it's crucial to do your own independent research before buying or selling anything. But if you're looking for ideas or just interested in what others think are hot trades in 2024, this list of trending Reddit stocks is worth a look:\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA)\n\nChargePoint Holdings Inc. (CHPT)\n\nDraftKings Inc. (DKNG)\n\nJoby Aviation Inc. (JOBY)\n\nRiot Platforms Inc. (RIOT)\n\nSoFi Technologies Inc. (SOFI)\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTilray Brands Inc. (TLRY)\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA)\n\nBack at the end of 2020, Asian e-commerce king Alibaba was riding high at around $300 a share. A host of problems since then, including the strangely low profile of its once-iconic CEO Jack Ma after a falling out with Chinese officials, have weighed on the stock and it now trades in the $70s. Obviously, a dramatic crash like that is cause for concern. But if you know anything about the meme stocks crowd, all they care about are big future moves regardless of past risks \u2013 and many on Reddit are taking out positions in the hope that Alibaba has a big comeback rally in store this year.\n\nChargePoint Holdings Inc. (CHPT)\n\nIn 2020, ChargePoint was caught up in the original meme stock mania as it quadrupled from about $10 a share to a short-lived high above $40. Nowadays, however, CHPT trades at a meager $2 or so per share after crashing and burning in the intervening years. This combination of prior success and a current single-digit share price makes CHPT a ripe target for meme stock investors who want a cheap stock pick in the EV space. As an operator of charging stations, ChargePoint is currently unprofitable as it looks to scale up and serve the plug-in fleet of the future. If the long-term promise still pans out, $2 per share could be a bargain \u2026 at least, that's what the Reddit bulls would have you believe if you can overlook the ugly plunge of more than 95% from its highs a few years back.\n\nDraftKings Inc. (DKNG)\n\nDraftKings is at the center of the online betting business that has been picking up steadily since a 2018 Supreme Court ruling overturned federal prohibitions on sportsbooks. The company is active in more than half of U.S. states, and as bettors continue to learn about new games and formats there is continued upside for DKNG if it plays its proverbial cards right. The stock has been volatile, like many meme stocks, but has more than doubled over the last year or so thanks to brisk growth and the hopes of consistent profitability in the near future. Reddit investors love to admit that their aggressive styles aren't all that different from mildly informed gambling, so it should be no surprise that DKNG is a popular meme stock in 2024.\n\nJoby Aviation Inc. (JOBY)\n\nThere have been plenty of volatile and potentially disruptive stocks that had their moment over the years, and Joby Aviation is cut from the same cloth as the high-octane 3D printing stocks or cloud computing firms. That's because Joby is a startup banking on a big and dynamic idea \u2013 all-electric vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, which can operate as taxis or short-distance aerial delivery vehicles. Ordering a flying Uber from your smartphone is too sexy an idea for many investors to pass up, so while JOBY has yet to move past its experimental phase, it remains a popular meme stock on Reddit. This could be a make-or-break year for the company, as it moves towards the final stage of its certification by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n\n\nRiot Platforms Inc. (RIOT)\n\nRiot is a cryptocurrency miner that was simply on fire in 2023. Sure, Bitcoin was up about 160% or so on the year. But RIOT stock surged more than twice that amount last year. Much like many investors watch specific energy stocks to play oil prices or miners to play gold prices, meme stock investors figured Riot Platforms could provide a similar supercharged way to play Bitcoin in 2023. The million-dollar questions for 2024, of course, aren't just whether Bitcoin will continue to run but also whether RIOT will continue to outperform the asset it's so dependent on.\n\nSoFi Technologies Inc. (SOFI)\n\nMidsized financial technology firm SoFi has had some ups and downs, and right now there's a lot of buzz behind it that's fueling the potential for big moves to the upside. Case in point: On Jan. 29, the stock surged a jaw-dropping 20% in a single session thanks to blowout fourth-quarter earnings. The company is not yet profitable, operating a digital portal for mortgages, student loans, investing and a host of other money-related services. Its long-term goal is to disrupt traditional leaders on Wall Street \u2013 and while it is volatile, the meme stock crowd seems to be very interested in what SoFi can do this year.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nUnlike some other stocks on this list, Tesla is very well known. But what makes Tesla a red-hot meme stock is not the fact that it's potentially a hidden gem. Rather, it's because it is so darn interesting to the Reddit crowd that they can't stop talking about it. They're not alone, either, as the electric vehicle leader regularly trades north of 100 million shares in a single session. There are a host of reasons for this, from the recent antics of CEO Elon Musk to a recent plunge in price that wiped out roughly $100 billion in market value since New Year's Day. Will Tesla bounce back and orchestrate a meteoric rise? Is the stock set for continued declines? Whatever side you're on, you're sure to find plenty of lively debate on the topic all over social media.\n\nTilray Brands Inc. (TLRY)"}

Tom Cotton, R-Ark.\n\nTikTok, which is operated by the Chinese firm ByteDance, has over 150 million users in America. U.S. lawmakers have regarded TikTok with considerable suspicion over whether its data can be accessed by the Chinese government and whether the app can be used to expand China\u2019s influence. Chinese companies are required to set up Communist Party cells.\n\n\u201cYou said today, as you often say, that you live in Singapore. Of what nation are you a citizen?\u201d Cotton asked.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nChew affirmed that he is Singaporean \u2014 which does not allow its citizens to hold dual citizenship \u2014 but Cotton pressed on, asking if Chew was a citizen of any other nation, and if he had ever applied for Chinese citizenship. China also does not permit dual nationality, and rarely accepts applications for citizenship.\n\nWhen Chew responded no to both questions, Cotton asked if he had ever been a member of the Chinese Communist Party or have had any affiliation to it.\n\n\u201cNo Senator, again, I\u2019m Singaporean,\u201d Chew responded, visibly perplexed. The party requires members to be Chinese citizens.\n\nCotton\u2019s line of questioning was described as \u201cMcCarthy-esque\u201d by The Washington Post. Clips of the exchange posted on social media platforms drew tens of thousands of views.\n\nAn Instagram reel of the exchange uploaded by Singapore flagship newspaper The Straits Times drew nearly 2,000 comments, most criticizing or mocking Cotton for his line of questioning.\n\n\u201cSenator, do you know where Singapore is?\u201d one person asked. Another remarked that \u201cjust because he looks Chinese, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s Chinese.\u201d\n\nAbout 75% of Singapore\u2019s approximately 5.9 million population is ethnically Chinese, a result of Chinese immigrants moving to Singapore in the 1800s and early 1900s. Many young Singaporeans today do not identify with China as a cultural motherland.\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing was Chew\u2019s second time appearing before U.S. lawmakers. He first testified in front of lawmakers in March 2023. That grilling lasted six hours, with lawmakers asking questions about TikTok\u2019s data security and harmful content on the platform.\n\nJojo Choo, an assistant marketing manager in her 30s, said she was happy to see a Singaporean appearing in Congress at first.\n\n\u201cInitially I felt pride because the CEO of such a huge company is actually someone from Singapore,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I quickly realized how ignorant the senator\u2019s questions were.\u201d\n\nChoo said the Cotton's questions were tinged with racism and it was \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d to assume that someone who\u2019s ethnically Chinese would be affiliated with China.\n\nAnother Singaporean, Fian Fazlie, said he was \u201ccompletely baffled yet amused\u201d at the senator\u2019s questioning.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just being ignorant and he\u2019s still justifying (his words) in his latest Instagram post,\u201d Fazlie, who works in the public transport sector, said about Cotton.\n\nCotton posted a clip of himself giving an interview on Fox News to Instagram, stating in the caption that Chew had \u201ca lot of explaining to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, you can be affiliated with or associated with the Chinese Communist Party anywhere in the world,\u201d Cotton said on Fox News, adding that the Biden administration has many cases against U.S. citizens suspected of collaborating or working with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\u201cSingapore unfortunately is one of the places in the world that has the highest degree of infiltration and influence by the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d said Cotton.\n\nIt's unclear what Cotton\u2019s claims about Singapore were based on.\n\nThe 41-year-old Chew is a native of Singapore, where he lives with his wife Vivian Kao and their three children. Prior to joining TikTok, Chew worked for five years at Xiaomi, a Chinese smartphone company. Before that, he was a partner at the venture capital firm DST Global and earlier worked at Goldman Sachs."}

Bragg\u2019s office was in the preliminary stages of discussions, internally and with Weisselberg's legal team, the people said. They may not necessarily lead to a criminal charge. The people were not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity.\n\nNews of a potential perjury charge was first reported by The New York Times. Messages seeking comment were left for Weisselberg\u2019s lawyers. Bragg\u2019s office declined comment. New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 office, which brought the civil lawsuit, also declined comment.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nWeisselberg served 100 days in jail last year for dodging taxes on $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation from the Trump Organization and is still on probation.\n\nA new charge, with the threat of more jail time, would upend the 76-year-old's Florida retirement and could weigh on his fierce allegiance to his old boss, who continues to pay his $2 million severance and legal bills.\n\nThe inquiry into the truthfulness of Weisselberg's testimony in the civil lawsuit is separate from the criminal case that Bragg brought against Trump last year over allegations that he falsified company records to cover up hush money payments. That trial is scheduled to begin in late March.\n\nBoth Bragg and James are Democrats.\n\nTestifying in the civil case, Weisselberg downplayed his involvement in preparing Trump\u2019s financial statements, which state lawyers allege inflated the former president\u2019s wealth by up to $3.6 billion. Frequently, he failed to answer questions clearly, uttering variations of \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d more than 100 times, according to transcripts.\n\nBut Weisselberg was firm in his response on Oct. 10 when a state lawyer asked him about how Trump's penthouse at Trump Tower came to be overvalued based on figures listing it as three times its actual size, 10,996 square feet (1,022 square meters).\n\nWeisselberg testified that he didn\u2019t pay much mind to the apartment\u2019s size because its value amounted to a fraction of Trump\u2019s wealth.\n\n\u201cI never even thought about the apartment. It was de minimis, in my mind,\u201d Weisselberg said, using a Latin term that means, essentially, too small to care about. \u201cIt was not something that was that important to me when looking at a $6 billion, $5 billion net worth,\u201d Weisselberg added.\n\nWeisselberg said he learned of the Trump Tower penthouse size discrepancy only when a Forbes magazine reporter pointed it out to him in 2016. He testified that he initially disputed the magazine\u2019s findings but said he couldn\u2019t recall whether he directed anyone to look into the matter.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t recall if you did anything to confirm who was right?\u201d state lawyer Louis Solomon asked.\n\nWeisselberg said he did not.\n\nHe was still on the witness stand when Forbes, whose reporters had discussed the size disparity with Weisselberg and revealed it publicly in 2017, published an article on its website suggesting he had perjured himself.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s Longtime CFO Lied, Under Oath, About Trump Tower Penthouse,\u201d the article\u2019s headline said. It said old emails and notes showed that Weisselberg had had extensive discussions with the magazine, trying to convince its writers that the penthouse was worth far more than they thought.\n\nThe penthouse gambit was one of several tricks state lawyers say was used to exaggerate Trump\u2019s net worth. A judge declared in September that the financial statements were fraudulent, but he has yet to rule on other issues that were the subject of the 2\u00bd-month trial where Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg pleaded guilty in August 2022 to charges he failed to pay taxes on $1.7 million in corporate perks, including a Manhattan apartment, Mercedes-Benz cars for him and his wife, and his grandchildren\u2019s school tuition.\n\nHe left New York City\u2019s notorious Rikers Island in April, days after Trump was indicted in his New York hush money criminal case.\n\nUnder that plea deal, Weisselberg was required to testify as a prosecution witness when the Trump Organization was put on trial for helping executives evade taxes. He did so carefully, laying out the facts of his own involvement in evading taxes but taking care not to implicate Trump, telling jurors that his boss was unaware of the scheme.\n\nA Trump Organization lawyer, Susan Necheles, told the AP last year that \u201cWeisselberg\u2019s testimony at trial was extremely helpful to the defense and hurt the prosecution.\u201d\n\nDuring the grand jury investigation last year that led to Trump\u2019s indictment, Bragg\u2019s office raised the possibility of charging Weisselberg with more crimes stemming from his decades managing the Trump Organization\u2019s finances.\n\nProsecutors suggested that might bring new charges related to his involvement in securing surety bonds and property valuations for the Trump Organization, alleged conduct that is the subject of James' civil lawsuit."}

(AP) \u2014 Tennessee only plans to participate for one year in a federal program that gives low-income families $40 per child per month to pay for food while school is out, the governor's office said Friday.\n\nTennessee is among 35 states, all five U.S. territories and four tribes that have opted into the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer program, or Summer EBT, for this summer. Fifteen other states, all currently with Republican governors, won\u2019t be participating.\n\nOfficials in President Joe Biden's administration say the money is meant to supplement existing programs during the summer that have had a more limited reach.\n\nIn announcing Tennessee doesn't plan to keep the benefit after one summer, Republican Gov. Bill Lee's office echoed arguments from some of the states not participating, saying the initiative stemmed from a pandemic-era benefit and that other food assistance programs are in place.\n\n\u201cTennessee enrolled in the Summer EBT program for FFY24 to ensure that families who depend on the benefits are served while the state returns to utilizing preexisting programs to meet the nutritional needs of children during summer months,\u201d said Elizabeth Johnson, a spokesperson for Lee. \"Established during the pandemic, Summer EBT was intended to supplement existing food assistance programs in extraordinary circumstances. We do not intend to enroll in future years.\u201d\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nSigne Anderson, senior director of nutrition advocacy at the nonprofit Tennessee Justice Center, said Summer EBT helps fill gaps in existing food programs for families who need help when school isn't in session. She said she's grateful Tennessee will offer the benefit this summer, but is extremely disappointed officials appear to be ruling out further participation.\n\n\u201cI think it is a mistake to not continue with Summer EBT in 2025 and beyond,\u201d Anderson said in an interview. \u201cAnd we will continue to advocate on behalf of the families that could use the extra money to buy groceries for their kids.\u201d\n\nIn December 2022, Congress made Summer EBT permanent starting in 2024 after the U.S. Department of Agriculture had tested it for several years. The states that chose not to opt in for this summer can still join for summer 2025, the USDA has said. Participating states will have to secure funding to pay half of their administrative costs.\n\nThe money will be on an EBT card, accepted at stores that also take Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.\n\nSome states who are not participating have used the denial to make statements about COVID-19 relief programs or welfare in general \u2014 Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, for one, said, \"I don\u2019t believe in welfare.\u201d Others cited logistical hurdles and left the door open to participating in future years.\n\nUnder the federal program, some 644,000 Tennessee children can receive $77.3 million more in aid this summer, creating a multiplied economic impact, according to the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.\n\nAll 50 states administer the existing Summer Food Service Program, which provides sites where kids can eat for free. Last month, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told The Associated Press he\u2019s worried that that program doesn\u2019t \u201cprovide the help for all the children, no matter how well-intentioned it is.\u201d\n\nTennessee, meanwhile, has drawn attention for its recent openness to losing federal money.\n\nThe state rebuffed roughly $9 million in federal HIV funding in January 2023 so it could refuse to fund Planned Parenthood. Months later, it was also disqualified from receiving more than $7 million under the Title X family planning program due to Tennessee's policies for those clinics not to discuss abortion referrals because of its abortion ban. In both instances, the state backfilled the funding, but the federal government circumvented the state to directly fund organizations like Planned Parenthood.\n\nAdditionally, lawmakers have flirted with becoming the first state to reject all federal K-12 education funding \u2014 some $1.8 billion annually \u2014 over LGBTQ+ protections, testing rules and other mandates. Lawmakers studying the issue ultimately didn't call for rejecting the money."}

After a strong 2023 performance, the S&P 500 is up 1.6% as of Jan. 31 and recently reached its first new all-time highs in two years. Top 2024 stock market performers include health care stocks with unique catalysts, takeover targets and stocks tied to former President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nAs of Jan. 31, these are the 10 best-performing stocks of 2024 among companies that trade on major U.S. exchanges and have market capitalizations of at least $1 billion:\n\nStock 2024 performance through Jan. 31 close Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd.

(ZIM)\n\nZim Integrated Shipping Services is an Israeli shipping and logistics services company. Zim has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of rising tensions in the Middle East since Hamas attacked Israel in October. Slumping shipping rates and concerns over Zim's large debt load weighed on the stock in early 2023. However, outbreaks of violence in Red Sea shipping lanes in recent months have sent shipping rates sharply higher. On Jan. 29, Jefferies upgraded Zim from \"hold\" to \"buy,\" arguing improved shipping rates will shift the company's cash flow from negative to positive. Zim shares are up 51.9% in 2024.\n\n9. Rumble Inc. (RUM)\n\nRumble is a video streaming platform that emphasizes a commitment to free speech and has a large conservative user base. Back in 2021, Rumble partnered with former President Trump's Truth Social to provide video hosting services for the social media platform. Trump's victory in the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary triggered a rally in Rumble shares in January. A new partnership between Rumble and sports media company Barstool Sports, announced on Jan. 22, added fuel to the fire. Rumble shares are up 52.6% so far in 2024.\n\n8. Dyne Therapeutics Inc. (DYN)\n\nDyne Therapeutics is an early clinical-stage drug developer targeting muscle diseases, including myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. The company's leading experimental therapies are DYNE-101 and DYNE-251, targeting DM1. In early January, Dyne's share price spiked when it reported promising trial data for DYNE-251 in treating DMD. Dyne's therapy reportedly involves a lower dose and higher efficacy than competitor Exondys 51, produced by Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (SRPT). The stock's momentum continued later in the month amid reports that larger pharmaceutical companies are interested in a takeover of Dyne. The stock was up 60.9% in January.\n\n7. Edgewise Therapeutics Inc. (EWTX)\n\nEdgewise Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on treatments for rare muscle disorders. The company's lead therapy is EDG-5506, an oral, small molecule drug used to treat both Becker and Duchenne muscular dystrophies. On Jan. 19, Edgewise announced it priced a $240 million stock offering at $11 per share, raising money the company needs to fund a potential U.S. commercial launch of EDG-5506, complete its remaining late-stage trials testing EDG-5506 in treating DMD and continue to develop its other assets. Edgewise shares gained 62.9% in January, propelled by investor optimism surrounding EDG-5506.\n\n6. NewAmsterdam Pharma Co. NV (NAMS)\n\nNewAmsterdam Pharma is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapies to treat metabolic diseases. The company's lead experimental therapy is obicetrapib, a selective cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor. The global heart disease and cholesterol markets are massive, and investors are betting big on NewAmsterdam. The stock got a boost in January when Piper Sandler initiated coverage of NewAmsterdam with an \"overweight\" rating and $37 price target. At the time, the stock was trading for less than $18 per share. Even after gaining 83.3% in January, NewAmsterdam's share price is still well below Piper Sandler's target, suggesting the rally could continue.\n\n\n\nREAD 5 of the Best Stocks to Buy Now\n\n5. Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI)\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a tech company that produces a wide range of computer hardware products, including servers, networking equipment, motherboards and chassis. As the broad tech sector recovered in 2023, investor enthusiasm for stocks exposed to cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and autonomous vehicles has surged. Super Micro Computer shares jumped last year, and that momentum has carried over into 2024. Given the company's exposure to several high-growth technology fields, it's understandable why investors are buying the stock. Super Micro Computer shares are up more than 545% since the beginning of 2023 and up 86.3% already in 2024.\n\n4. Kaman Corp. (KAMN)\n\nKaman designs and manufactures aircraft and aircraft parts, including proprietary aircraft bearings, spring energized seals, and complex metallic and composite structures. On Jan. 19, Arcline Investment Management announced a $1.8 billion buyout of Kaman priced at $46 per share, a roughly 105% premium to its previous day's closing price. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of the year. The stock more than doubled the day the buyout deal was announced and is now trading within $1 of the $46 buyout price. Kaman's 88.1% January gain makes it one of the top-performing stocks of 2024.\n\n3. Ambrx Biopharma Inc. (AMAM)\n\nAmbrx Biopharma is a drugmaker targeting multiple forms of cancer using antibody-drug conjugates, which are specialized treatments that directly target and kill cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. On Jan. 8, pharma giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) announced a $2 billion buyout of Ambrx priced at $28 per share, more than double the stock's closing price of $13.63 on the previous day. Johnson & Johnson said it expects to close the deal in the first half of 2024. The takeover news understandably sent Ambrx shares ripping higher by 95.2% in January to within cents of the $28 buyout price.\n\n2. Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC)\n\nDigital World Acquisition is a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, that plans to take Donald Trump's media company, Trump Media & Technology Group, public. Investors seemingly saw Trump's victories in the Republican Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary as good news for Trump's business and the SPAC that intends to acquire it. Trump will likely be the Republican nominee for president in the 2024 election, which means plenty of social media engagement. Digital World shares are already up 116.9% this year on Trump's political momentum.\n\n1. Vera Therapeutics Inc. (VERA)"}

So she called the police.\n\nWhat happened next that evening in May 2021 is the basis for a lawsuit by the mother alleging that Burlington police used excessive force and discriminated against her unarmed son, who is Black and has behavioral and intellectual disabilities.\n\nAfter he failed to hand over the last of the stolen e-cigarettes, two officers physically forced him to do so, then Cathy Austrian\u2019s son was handcuffed and pinned to the ground as he screamed and struggled, according to a civil lawsuit filed Tuesday and police body-camera video shared with The Associated Press by the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont.\n\nThe teen eventually was injected with a ketamine, a sedative, then taken to a hospital, according to the lawsuit and video.\n\n\u201cThe police chose to respond to my son with unprovoked violence and use of force, when they could and should have followed their own procedures and used safe, supportive methods,\u201d Austrian said in a statement provided by the ACLU of Vermont, which is representing her case.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nThe ordeal underscores the need for sufficient police training in dealing with people with disabilities and mental health challenges, and raises questions about whether police are best suited to respond to such situations, advocates say. A growing number of U.S. communities are responding to nonviolent mental health crises with clinicians and EMTs or paramedics, instead of police.\n\nBurlington police officers had visited the home before and were aware of the teen's disabilites, the lawsuit says. Austrian fostered the child, who had developmental and intellectual disabilities like his birth mother, since he was 5 months old and adopted him at age 2, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe Associated Press generally doesn't identify minors who are accused of crimes or who are witnesses to them.\n\nBody-camera video shows two officers talking calmly to the teen, who is sitting on a bed. His mother tells him to cooperate; she goes through drawers and finds most of the remaining e-cigarettes and tries to get the last one from him.\n\nOfficers say if he turns the e-cigarettes over, they'll leave and he won't be charged. He doesn't respond. After about 10 minutes, the officers move in to forcibly remove the last of the e-cigarettes from his hand by pulling his arms behind his back and pinning the 230-pound teen against the bed.\n\nAdante Pointer, a civil rights attorney in the San Francisco Bay area, said officers were doing the appropriate thing at first \u2014 discussing consequences and trying to establish rapport.\n\n\"The turning point in this chain of events is when officers decided to go hands-on,\u201d said Pointer, who watched the video but isn't connected to the case.\n\n\u201cThere wasn't any urgency here, there wasn't any emergency where they had to force physical confrontation,\u201d said Pointer, who noted the teen was contained in a room with his mother and wasn't a violent felon trying to flee.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks punitive damages against the city and monetary damages and relief for the teen. It also seeks an order for the city to accommodate people with disabilities in policing interactions, including implementing officer training and modifying policies on ketamine use.\n\nThe use of ketamine has come under scrutiny. In Colorado, two paramedics were convicted late last year for injecting Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man, with an overdose of the sedative after police put him in a neck hold and he later died.\n\nA city spokeswoman said Burlington investigated and found that officers and fire department EMTs acted according to city policy and state law and regulations.\n\n\u201cWe expect to vigorously and successfully defend against the allegations,\u201d Samantha Sheehan said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nAfter the investigation, Mayor Miro Weinberger ordered the Burlington Fire Department to review the use of ketamine, Sheehan said via email. The state has updated protocols to require doctor permission for all sedation of patients with combative behavior, which wasn't required at the time, although responding paramedics did get a doctor's permission, she wrote. A directive on dealing with people with diminished capacities is being reviewed and is expected to be rewritten by the Police Commission, according to Sheehan.\n\nWhen the two officers arrived to speak to the teen, Austrian told them her son was acting erratically and had a rough week. She said he had an MRI of his heart that week, and his medicine for ADHD had been increased the week before. She said he left the house with a hammer and scissors and returned with a bag full of e-cigarettes he admitted he'd stolen from a Cumberland Farms convenience store. He gave her half of them but wouldn\u2019t give up the others, she said.\n\nAfter officers got the final stolen item, they said in their police reports, the teen tried to kick and punch them. The lawsuit says the teen \u201creflexively rose from the bed and flailed his arms haphazardly at the officers.\"\n\nThat response \u201cis typical of individuals with his disability and trauma history who are placed in unnecessary physical restraints and denied space,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nThe officers handcuffed him and eventually pinned him to the floor on his stomach. The teen thrashed, screamed and swore. Officers told him to stop spitting, and paramedics, who police called, placed a spit hood over his head.\n\nThey then injected the teen with ketamine. They said the teen's distress was \u201cexcited delirium,\u201d a term the medical community has rejected, the ACLU said.\n\nHe was carried out of the house unconscious on a stretcher and spent the night in the hospital, the lawsuit states.\n\nIn calling the police, his mother was looking for help in getting him to do the right thing, said Pointer, the attorney.\n\n\u201cInstead of getting that type of help, her kid was brutalized,\u201d said Pointer. \u201cHer kid was handcuffed, man-handled, a spit bag placed over his head, and administered a very powerful and deadly sedative, and now she\u2019s left to pick up the pieces.\u201d"}

The agency was unable to consider it because the state had failed to meet requirements to seek an extension, including a public notice and comment period, CMS Deputy Administrator and Director Daniel Tsai said in a Dec. 22 letter.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp said in a news release announcing the lawsuit that the Biden administration was again trying to \u201cinterfere with Georgia\u2019s innovative plan.\" He accused the administration of playing politics \u201cby refusing to give us back the time they stole from delaying the Pathways rollout and implementation.\u201d\n\nIn his December letter to the state, Tsai said the agency did not stop Georgia officials from implementing other aspects of Pathways when it revoked the work requirement and a plan to charge some Medicaid recipients monthly premiums. And he said an implementation period that was shorter than the originally approved timeline was not unique to Georgia.\n\n\u201cMany states experience delayed implementation of their demonstration projects (or initiatives within a demonstration project) for various reasons,\u201d he said.\n\nGeorgia's plan offers health care coverage to able-bodied adults earning up to the poverty line \u2014 $14,580 for an individual or $24,860 for a family of three. But people must document 80 monthly hours of work, study, rehabilitation or volunteering to be eligible.\n\nRepublicans have presented the plan as a financially responsible alternative to a full expansion of Medicaid services under the Affordable Care Act, though opposition to full expansion appears to have softened. Georgia is one of 10 states without broader Medicaid coverage.\n\nThe Kemp administration has estimated Pathways could add 100,000 poor and uninsured Georgia residents to the Medicaid rolls, but enrollment so far has been slow, with just under 2,350 people enrolled as of mid-December.\n\nThe work requirement was approved by then-President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, but the Biden administration announced in December 2021 that it was revoking that approval and the premium requirement. That prompted Georgia officials to sue.\n\nA federal judge reinstated both parts of the program in 2022, saying the revocation was arbitrary and capricious."}

The historical averages posted by funds are usually presented first on a pretax basis, and the actual net returns received by investors can be significantly different once taxes are factored in.\n\nTake, for example, Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (ticker: VFIAX), a mutual fund comprising large-cap U.S. stocks. This fund returned an annualized 12% before taxes over the past 10 years as of Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nHowever, after accounting for taxes, this return was reduced to 11.5%. While this might seem like a small difference, over long periods the compounded impact can create a substantial gap in wealth accumulation.\n\n\n\nThe tax impact can be even more pronounced for investments that are less tax-efficient than large-cap U.S. stocks. Real estate investment trusts, or REITs, foreign stock funds and bonds, for instance, may face higher tax rates on their distributions.\n\nThis is where asset location, or the strategic placement of different types of investments in various accounts, becomes crucial. A key tool in this strategy is the Roth IRA.\n\n\"A Roth IRA is an account that you can contribute after-tax contributions to, with investment returns, income and dividends growing tax-deferred,\" says Scott Krase, wealth manager at Connor & Gallagher OneSource.\n\nIn 2024, the contribution limit for a Roth IRA is $7,000, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution allowed for those 50 and older. Eligibility for contributing to a Roth IRA is based on modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI, thresholds; single filers making less than $146,000 and joint filers making less than $230,000 can qualify for the full contribution.\n\nThe main benefits of a Roth IRA include tax-free growth on dividends, capital gains and income within the account, and withdrawals can be made without penalty after age 59 1/2, provided the account has been open for at least five years.\n\n\"Roth IRAs are an attractive financial savings vehicle because investors can contribute to them regardless of age and take advantage of tax-free income in retirement, with no required minimum distribution, unlike a traditional IRA, which requires distributions at age 73,\" says Tiana Patillo, financial advisor manager at Vanguard.\n\nThese features make Roth IRAs an ideal location for holding less tax-efficient investments, helping investors maximize their after-tax returns and achieve their financial goals more effectively.\n\nHere are seven of the best mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, to hold in a Roth IRA:\n\nFund Expense ratio Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTWAX) 0.1% Avantis All Equity Markets ETF (AVGE) 0.23% Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund Investor Shares (VWINX) 0.23% Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQM) 0.15% iShares Morningstar Multi-Asset Income ETF (IYLD) 0.6% Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (SCHH) 0.07% Fidelity Freedom Index 2060 Fund Investor Class (FDKLX) 0.12%\n\nVanguard Total World Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTWAX)\n\n\"Roth IRAs are especially beneficial for younger investors because there is greater saving potential due to that tax-free compounding,\" Patillo says. One of the easiest investment theses for young investors to bet on is the prospect of the global economy continuing to grow. That is, by investing in the global stock market in a passive manner, young investors can reap the benefits of predictable long-term returns.\n\nTo put this strategy in play, young investors can buy and hold VTWAX in a Roth IRA. This highly diversified mutual fund tracks the FTSE Global All Cap Index, which holds over 9,700 stocks split approximately 60% in the U.S. market, 30% in international developed markets and 10% in emerging markets, respectively. The fund requires a $3,000 minimum investment and charges a reasonable 0.1% expense ratio.\n\nAvantis All Equity Markets ETF (AVGE)\n\nInvestors looking to outperform VTWAX can use factor ETFs like AVGE, which tilts toward companies with smaller sizes, lower valuations and profitability. \"This combination implies these companies have a high discount rate embedded in their market price, and a high discount rate generally drives higher expected returns for investors,\" says Ted Randall, senior portfolio manager at Avantis Investors.\n\nAVGE's composition resembles that of VTWAX, with allocations toward U.S., developed and emerging markets via underlying Avantis ETFs. However, it holds a higher weighting toward small-cap value ETFs. \"Academic research shows that companies trading at low price multiples with good profitability are expected to outperform, and that this performance premium is greater within small caps,\" Randall says. AVGE charges a 0.23% expense ratio.\n\nVanguard Wellesley Income Fund Investor Shares (VWINX)\n\n\"Generally, investors should allocate funds that are less tax-efficient in a Roth IRA,\" says Lauren Wybar, senior wealth advisor at Vanguard. \"For example, taxable bonds and REITs make regular income payments, and actively managed stock funds are more likely to distribute taxable capital gains.\" A great example of an actively managed, income-oriented Vanguard fund suitable for a Roth IRA is VWINX.\n\nVWINX is one of Vanguard's oldest mutual funds, debuting in July 1970. This fund uses a conservative strategy of allocating one-third to dividend stocks and two-thirds to investment-grade bonds. Since inception, VWINX has returned an annualized 9.2%. With a 4.1% 30-day SEC yield, this fund is capable of meeting the 4% withdrawal rate suggested for retirees. It charges a 0.23% expense ratio.\n\nInvesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQM)\n\n\"If you are younger and retirement is still years away, consider allocating a good portion toward mutual funds or ETFs that focus on growth,\" says Jim Penna, senior manager of retirement services at VectorVest Inc. \"Historically, these investments have potential for higher growth over time that you will generally pay no taxes on when held in a Roth IRA.\" A great example is QQQM, which tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index.\n\nQQQM's portfolio consists of the largest 100 non-financial-sector stocks traded on the Nasdaq exchange, which, practically speaking, translates to high technology sector exposure at around 50%. Over the past 10 years, the outperformance of mega-cap tech sector stocks has helped the ETF's index achieve a 17.9% annualized return. QQQM charges a 0.15% expense ratio.\n\n\n\niShares Morningstar Multi-Asset Income ETF (IYLD)\n\n\"To take advantage of the tax benefits, it is generally better to hold investments in your Roth IRA that would otherwise generate taxable income,\" Penna says. \"For example, stocks that pay dividends or generate capital gains, real estate investment trusts, or REITs, known for favorable dividend payouts, and high-yield bond funds also fit into this category.\"\n\nRetirees who rely on their Roth IRAs to generate tax-free income can use a multi-asset ETF like IYLD. This ETF holds all of the assets mentioned by Penna and more via underlying ETFs that provide exposure to global dividend stocks, preferred shares, high-yield bonds, investment-grade bonds and mortgage REITs. IYLD currently pays a 5.7% 30-day SEC yield and charges a 0.6% expense ratio.\n\nSchwab U.S. REIT ETF (SCHH)\n\n\"In a Roth IRA, REIT funds are great holdings for taking advantage of the comparatively high tax-free distributions,\" says Kaleb Paddock, founder and certified financial planner at Ten Talents Financial Planning. \"In addition, you also benefit from price appreciation given the historically strong returns REIT investing and the real estate sector have provided.\"\n\nFor exposure to real estate in a Roth IRA, investors can buy a REIT ETF like SCHH. This ETF passively tracks the Dow Jones Equity All REIT Capped Index, which excludes higher yielding but potentially more volatile mortgage REITs. At present, investors can expect a high 4% 30-day SEC yield from SCHH, with quarterly distributions. The ETF charges a low 0.07% expense ratio.\n\nFidelity Freedom Index 2060 Fund Investor Class (FDKLX)\n\nLong-term investors looking for a hands-off, buy-and-hold investment for a Roth IRA can use a target-date fund like FDKLX. As its name suggests, this mutual fund is intended for investors who are looking to retire around 2060. It currently provides an all-in-one portfolio of 54% in U.S. stocks, 36% in international stocks and 10% in bonds for a 0.12% expense ratio, with no minimum investment requirements."}

The authors found that the combined harm of extreme heat and inhalation of wildfire smoke increased hospitalizations and disproportionately impacted low-income communities and Latino, Black, Asian and other racially marginalized residents.\n\nThe reasons are varied and complicated, according to the authors from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego and the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. Structural racism, discriminatory practices, lack of medical insurance, less understanding of the health damages and a higher prevalence of multiple coexisting conditions are among the reasons.\n\nInfrastructure, the surrounding environment and available resources are also factors. Homes and work places with air conditioning and neighborhoods with tree canopy cover are better protected from extreme heat, and some buildings filter smoke from wildfires and insulate heat more efficiently. Areas with access to cooling centers, such as libraries, also offer more protection.\n\n\u201cEven if you\u2019re very susceptible \u2014 you have a lot of comorbidities \u2014 you may have many opportunities to not be impacted, not being hospitalized, not having to go to the ER, but if you live in a place that is quite remote that does not have access to a lot of social services or amenities, ... it may be more trouble,\u201d said Tarik Benmarhnia, a study author and climate change epidemiologist at UC San Diego.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nExperts warn that climate change \u2014 which is worsening extreme weather events such as droughts, heat waves and wildfires \u2014 will increase the frequency and intensity in which they occur simultaneously.\n\nWhile the study focused on California, similar patterns can be found in other parts of the western United States such as Oregon and Washington state, in parts of Canada including British Columbia, and in regions with Mediterranean climate, said Benmarhnia.\n\nResearchers analyzed California health records \u2014 broken down by 995 ZIP codes covering most of the state's population \u2014 during episodes of extreme heat and toxic air from wildfires. They discovered that between 2006 and 2019, hospitalizations for cardiorespiratory issues increased by 7% on days where both conditions existed, and they were higher than that in ZIP codes where people were likelier to be poor, nonwhite, living in dense areas and not have health care.\n\nCalifornia's Central Valley and the state's northern mountains had higher incidences of both hot weather and wildfires, likely driven by more forest fires in surrounding mountains.\n\nResidents in the Central Valley agricultural heartland are particularly vulnerable to the adverse health effects of both because they are likelier to work outdoors and be exposed to pesticides and other environmental hazards, said Benmarhnia.\n\nBeyond the health risks, being hospitalized has other significant consequences, such as losing hours of work or school, or being left with hefty medical bills.\n\nDuring extremely hot days, the human body has a harder time cooling itself off through sweating, said Christopher T. Minson, professor of human physiology at the University of Oregon, who wasn't part of the study. The body can become dehydrated, forcing the heart to beat faster, which elevates blood pressure.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re dehydrated or if you have any kind of cardiovascular disease, ... you\u2019re going to be less able to tolerate that heat stress, and that heat stress can become very, very dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\nSome particles found in wildfire smoke can enter easily through the nose and throat, eventually arriving at the lungs, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The smallest particles can even enter the bloodstream.\n\nThe combination of heat and smoke can cause inflammation in the body, Minson said, which is \u201cgoing to make all your cardiovascular regulation worse, and you\u2019re going to be at even more risk of heart attacks and other problems like long term, poor health outcomes from that. So it\u2019s definitely a snowball effect.\u201d\n\nA 2022 study by the University of Southern California found that the risk of death surged on days when extreme heat and air pollution coincided. During heat waves, the likelihood of death increased by 6.1%; when air pollution was extreme, it rose by 5%; and on days when both combined, the threat skyrocketed to 21%.\n\nWhen Dr. Catharina Giudice worked at a hospital in Los Angeles, she noticed an uptick of emergency room visits from patients with various health conditions on extremely hot days. When wildfires blazed, she saw more people with exacerbated asthma and other respiratory diseases.\n\nAs climate change fuels the intensity and frequency of heat waves and wildfires, Giudice worries about the low-income and minority communities that are less adapted to them.\n\n\u201cFor a variety of reason, they tend to feel climate change much worse than other non-underserved communities, and I think it's really important to highlight this social injustice aspect of climate change,\u201d said the emergency physician and fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who was not part of the study.\n\nThe authors noted that agencies like the National Weather Service and local air quality districts issue separate advisories and warnings on days of extreme heat and toxic air. But they argue that \u201cissuing a joint warning earlier considering the compound exposure would be beneficial.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Although Bragg\u2019s office did not oversee the fraud trial, which is being prosecuted by the office of the state\u2019s attorney general, Letitia James, Bragg\u2019s office has been investigating a criminal case against Trump over an alleged hush-money payment made during his 2016 campaign.\n\nBragg\u2019s office has charged Trump with falsifying business records. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, said \u201clegal fees\u201d that were reported on records were actually reimbursements for a payment Cohen made on Trump\u2019s behalf to the former adult film star Stormy Daniels. Weisselberg helped coordinate Cohen\u2019s reimbursement, Cohen has said.\n\nIn exchange for pleading guilty to perjury \u2013 a crime punishable with prison time \u2013 Weisselberg may not be called to the witness stand during the hush-money trial, according to the newspaper. That trial is scheduled to start in March.\n\nProsecutors are probably hoping that if Weisselberg admits to perjury it would dissuade other Trump allies from lying on the stand. Weisselberg, a decades-long employee of the Trump Organization and staunchly loyal ally of Trump, has also disputed that Trump was involved with the hush-money payment. Discrediting Weisselberg as a witness, even if prosecutors not end up calling him to the stand, could strengthen their case.\n\nLawyers for Weisselberg did not respond to requests for comment. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment on the potential deal.\n\nIf Weisselberg pleads guilty to perjury, it would be the second guilty plea deal the former Trump Organization executive has made with prosecutors. Weisselberg spent 100 days at Rikers jail in New York City after pleading guilty to tax fraud for dishing out off-the-table benefits to himself and other Trump executives.\n\nAlong with the former president, Weisselberg is a defendant in Trump\u2019s civil fraud trial. Trump\u2019s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, and former Trump Organization executive Jeff McConney are also defendants. Trump is being sued for $370m for inflating the value of his assets on government financial statements over the course of a decade.\n\nWeisselberg testified early on in the trial, in October, and was often evasive on the stand, saying he did not recall much about what prosecutors were asking him.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Trump on Trial Free newsletter Stay up to date on all of Donald Trump\u2019s trials.

In financial documents, Trump reported that the triplex was 30,000 sq ft. In reality, the apartment is closer to 11,000 sq ft.\n\nOn the stand, Weisselberg said he did not notice the discrepancy on financial documents as he \u201cnever even thought\u201d about the apartment. \u201cIt was de minimis, in my mind,\u201d he said.\n\nForbes disputed this statement, though, saying it had emails and notes showing that Weisselberg for years tried to convince the magazine that the triplex was worth more than it actually was. Weisselberg abruptly ended his testimony after the article was published.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, who is overseeing the fraud trial, has signaled that a verdict for the $370m will be filed by mid-February."}

The last time I saw him he was thin, he looked weak and vulnerable.\u201d\n\nPolice said Ezedi was seen in the Tooting area of south-west London at about 6.30am, then at several other points in south London throughout the day prior to the attack in Clapham.\n\nWithin eight minutes of the attack, he had boarded a train at nearby Clapham South tube station, police said, and he was later seen at King\u2019s Cross station. He then took a Victoria line train south.\n\n\u201cThe mother remains very poorly in hospital and she\u2019s sedated at the moment. We expect that those injuries will be life-changing,\u201d Savell said on Friday. \u201cThankfully, we\u2019ve had an update from the hospital that the two young children that were with her, their injuries aren\u2019t as serious as first thought and they are not likely to be life-changing.

He wanted them \u201cforgotten about and locked up\u201d, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re nothing.\u201d Frances Crook, former head of the Howard League for Penal Reform, commented on X (formerly Twitter): \u201cAs soon as the children who killed Brianna Ghey are named they will be the entire prurient focus of the media. The victim is passed over,\u201d and that was borne out: immediately after the names dropped, images of the killers were all over social and mainstream media, described as the \u201cfaces of evil\u201d.\n\nExplaining her decision to lift the reporting ban, Mrs Justice Amanda Yip said last year that \u201cthe shock generated by Brianna\u2019s murder and the circumstances of it has spread well beyond the local community, across the nation and indeed internationally\u201d. She accepted that to name the killers would cause distress for their families, but said the purpose of an anonymity order was not to protect the relatives of the convicted. But exactly what is the point of anonymity orders for under-18s? Why did a government review of the youth justice system recommend lifelong anonymity for children in 2016 (it is currently lifted when they turn 18)? And conversely, what social purpose does it now serve to know the identities of Ghey\u2019s killers? What conversation does it start, and what other conversations does it shut down?\n\nWith the names have come grim details: the psychiatrist who saw Scarlett Jenkinson after the murder said the teenager felt \u201csatisfied and excited\u201d during it; while the judge has said that Eddie Ratcliffe was driven in part by transphobia, Jenkinson has said she was more threatened by the idea that Ghey might stop being her friend. Inevitably, with details and photos of the perpetrators emerging, the story becomes both personalised and generalised. It descends into analysis and speculation about Jenkinson and Ratcliffe\u2019s mental states, while at the same time conjuring questions about the nature of evil. The social benefit of putting these two teenagers in the petri dish and extrapolating from the scrutiny any solid principles about human nature is very hard to divine. Most likely it will be, as it was after the killing of James Bulger, a self-soothing exercise, in which the heinous criminals are demonised to the extent that the society in which their crime happened doesn\u2019t have to ask any questions about itself.\n\nYet there are urgent questions to ask: at the time of the murder, the police were very careful with the label \u201chate crime\u201d, and it has taken Justice Yip\u2019s sentencing remarks, nearly a year later, for transphobia to be acknowledged as an aggravating factor. We already knew from Ghey\u2019s own TikTok account, and numerous testimonies from her friends and their parents, that she had been abused online for years for being trans. We know that her teen years, brutally cut short, were defined, marred by this persecution. We know that transphobic hate crime reports quadrupled between 2015 and 2020; we know from individual police force data how dramatic the rise over 20 years has been. The Met released figures showing 23 transphobic hate crimes across London in 2001, and 428 in 2021.\n\nWe know that when the rightwing media selects a hate group and constantly demonises it, it has real-world consequences. We can see so plainly how language gives licence to real-life violence \u2013 the judge highlighted the \u201cdehumanising\u201d language Radcliffe used to describe Ghey prior to the murder \u2013 and yet it is somehow still considered melodramatic to say so.\n\nIt\u2019s time to recognise that so many vocal opponents of trans people know no such restraint; they are not afraid of melodrama, they are untroubled by incomplete information, they don\u2019t care if they sound obsessional or disproportionate. No issue is too niche, or too distant, or too petty, or too illogical, for their fury. A child having to use a toilet cubicle previously occupied by a trans woman is apparently the right-thinking parent\u2019s most pressing fear. A teacher who refuses to use a pupil\u2019s chosen pronouns is the Achilles of the culture wars. Mediocre politicians get the attention they crave by making puerile remarks about trans people\u2019s genitalia. Where does it end? Do all the trans people of the UK have to detransition? Or would it be enough if they just went into hiding?\n\nThe condition of being trans in this country at the moment is one of being subject to constant negative scrutiny, sensing oneself collectively blamed for every action by any trans person, anywhere in the world, considered ridiculous by definition while simultaneously the cause of the nation\u2019s most serious problems. The intense drumbeat of peril and surveillance is the hallmark of paranoid delusion: but they\u2019re not being paranoid. Trans people have been used instrumentally as a muster point for the right, and the far right, in media and in politics, and this has concrete, foreseeable results.\n\nThe reason for that 2016 finding that young offenders should have their anonymity protected in perpetuity was that it makes it very hard to rejoin society when your grave and repugnant crime is in the public domain for ever. That relatively obvious point must have occurred to the judge, who \u2013 weighing it against the public interest \u2013 decided their social exclusion was a price worth paying.

It is different to school absence due to truancy. It is when a child or young person experiences extreme anxiety or distress relating to attending school. This fear can be so great that they avoid going to school.\u201d\n\nKrause, who has developed five apps to help troubled young people manage their mental health, said that 24% of those avoiding school said they did so because of family difficulties, 18% due to bullying or friendship issues and others because of exam stress.\n\n\u201cThese findings are very alarming as they show the far-reaching impact untreated anxiety and other mental health difficulties can have on a young person\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cWhat can start as a few days off school can quickly spiral into persistent absence. Without specialist support, which is both expensive and time-consuming, some children and young people will have their education, and through this their life chances, significantly impacted,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the representative sample of 1,025 young people, 48% said they were suffering mental health distress and had anxiety, depression, an eating disorder or other diagnosable condition. Among them, 50% had missed school because they were too anxious to go in.\n\nThe findings come amid acute concern among schools, parents and ministers at school absenteeism. For example, one in 10 pupils in England in their GCSE year were absent in the last school year \u2013 70% more than before Covid struck in early 2020.\n\nThe former shadow mental health minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who led a Commons debate last week on children\u2019s mental health, said the survey had uncovered \u201can epidemic of unhappiness that is keeping children away from the classroom\u201d.\n\nTo address it, she said, \u201cwe need specialists in schools, a recruitment drive to fix chronic staffing issues in mental health services and work undertaken to enable young people to access support in their communities.\u201d\n\nPaul Whiteman, the general secretary of the school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: \u201cSchools have seen more children struggling with their mental health in recent years, especially since the pandemic, and this impacts not only their learning but also their attendance and behaviour.\u201d\n\nHe urged ministers to ensure that every school had a mental health support team \u2013 only 38% of those in England do so \u2013 and that all schools and colleges could provide counselling.\n\nProf Sir Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, has told parents that children with mild to moderate anxiety should still come to school because prolonged absence can make them worse. The government has unveiled plans for attendance hubs and attendance mentors to tackle the problem.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cAttendance is vital for a child\u2019s wellbeing, development, and attainment and that is why we have launched a national campaign to support persistently absent children back into school.\n\n\u201cThis campaign is backed by the launch of 18 new attendance hubs, increasing the total to 32, to support 2,000 schools on top of \u00a315m to expand a pilot mentoring programme.\n\n\u201cAlongside this, we are boosting mental health support for children in schools, including by offering senior mental health lead training to all schools and colleges by 2025, extending coverage of mental health support teams to at least 50% of pupils in England by the end of March 2025, and providing \u00a32.3bn a year for NHS mental health services to reach an additional 345,000 children.\u201d"}

This is amazing!\u201d she shouted. Not many authors are treated to a rockstar reception like this \u2013 but Maas\u2019s books, the most popular of which are the Throne of Glass and A Court of Thorns and Roses series, have sold 37m copies worldwide in 38 languages.\n\nView image in fullscreen Iron Flame by Rebecca Yarros. Photograph: PR\n\nThe American novelist is among a new generation of uber-bestselling authors writing \u201cromantasy\u201d, a portmanteau of \u201cromance\u201d and \u201cfantasy\u201d applied to novels that blend elements of both genres. Alongside Maas on bestseller charts is Rebecca Yarros, whose novel Iron Flame became Waterstones\u2019 highest-selling pre-order title in a single day, four months ahead of its release last November.\n\nIt is unclear where the \u201cromantasy\u201d label originated: though Bloomsbury said it coined the term to \u201cidentify the genre [Maas] was spearheading\u201d, the term was posted on Urban Dictionary as early as 2008. In any case, its usage has exploded in the last year on social media and in marketing copy for fantasy romance titles.\n\nRomantasy authors are selling well in part because of their huge popularity on social media; Maas\u2019 publisher, Bloomsbury, says that videos with hashtags connected to her books have more than 14bn views on TikTok alone. On \u201cBookTok\u201d, the corner of the platform dedicated to book-related content, fans share their rankings of book series, theories about what might happen in future novels, compilations of favourite quotes and outfits inspired by books.\n\nSuch novels are typically set in fantastical worlds, with fairies, dragons, magic, but also feature classic romance plotlines \u2013 enemies-to-lovers, soulmates, love triangles. \u201cRomance readers have discovered that romantasy has all the tropes they adore, but set in a world they can escape to and get lost in,\u201d explains Ajebowale Roberts, an editor at HarperCollins.\n\n\u201cThe Bachelor meets The Hunger Games\u201d is how Canadian author Nisha J Tuli describes one of her romantasy novels, Trial of the Sun Queen. \u201cThe thing I love about romantasy is that the romance can have these world-ending stakes that you just can\u2019t get with an office romcom,\u201d she adds. \u201cI love the whole \u2018he murdered your whole family, but now you\u2019re going to fall in love\u2019 \u2013 something which you can really only create in a fantasy world.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Bookmarks Free weekly newsletter Discover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.

Kerri Maniscalco, author of Throne of the Fallen, says that spicy books allow a \u201csafe space for readers to explore their own fantasies\u201d in an unapologetic way. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see readers online exploring that too and not being shy or ashamed\u201d. HarperCollins\u2019s Roberts says that seeing an \u201cincreased reader demand for spicy new adult books\u201d led to the publisher\u2019s Magpie imprint planning a dedicated list of romantasy titles, called the Midnight Collection, which will launch in spring.\n\nThe genre\u2019s appeal may also be down to its \u201cbold heroines\u201d and \u201cstrong yet nuanced female characters\u201d, says Kathleen Farrar at Bloomsbury. \u201cThese stories have attracted huge numbers of female readers who may previously not have felt particularly welcome or catered for in the fantasy market.\u201d\n\nRomantasy \u201callows women to have it all\u201d, says Christina Clark-Brown, who shares book recommendations on the Instagram page ninas_nook. \u201cThere is no damsel who needs saving but rather women are allowed to be powerful, go on epic quests, and find love with a partner who is an equal to them in every way.\u201d\n\nGeorgia Summers, whose book The City of Stardust was released in January, says that \u201cwe\u2019re seeing fantasy normalise queer romance, normalise having people of colour in fantasy and have it not be the traditional white male medieval village scenario\u201d.\n\nWhile many bestselling romantasy novels have predominantly white and straight main characters, Tuli says this is \u201cslowly, slowly\u201d changing. \u201cAll my main characters are brown girls, which is obviously very rare in this genre as of now,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut that\u2019s something that very much from day one has been really important to me because I never read anything like that before five years ago.\u201d\n\nThe Midnight Collection is launching with Lore of the Wilds by Analeigh Sbrana, which features an all-Black cast. \u201cThe Midnight Collection was born out of real reader demand and our readers come from all walks of life so it\u2019s only fitting that our list reflects the depth and breadth of the diversity of our readers,\u201d says Roberts.\n\nThe popularity of romantasy may also be a sign of the times. \u201cWhen you look at on the global scale what\u2019s going on socially, politically, economically, Covid \u2013 all of these things are giving readers this need to escape,\u201d says Maniscalco.\n\nSummers explains that while another subgenre of fantasy, \u201cgrimdark\u201d, was popular in the early 2010s with \u201cgritty, dark\u201d tales such as Game of Thrones, we are now seeing \u201cthe rise of cosy fantasy and romantasy and fairytale fantasy \u2013 books that have a bit more of an uplifting feel to them.\u201d\n\nThese books offer readers a sense of hope, she adds. Fantasy has \u201cdone so well all of a sudden, in these recent times, when hope seems a little bit in short supply\u201d."}

We shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions, and I would expect the home secretary to conduct a detailed review of what has happened and what may have gone seriously wrong in this case, and to put that information in the public domain, such is the public interest.\u201d\n\nHowever, Amnesty International warned that the attack should not be used as a pretext to target people seeking asylum or undermine the process, as the charity said its \u201chearts went out to the victims\u201d involved.\n\n\u201cThe government urgently needs to ensure that the claims of anyone seeking asylum in the UK are decided fairly and efficiently and not be distracted by those seeking to exploit the Clapham attack for their own ends,\u201d said Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty UK\u2019s chief executive.\n\n\u201cThere will always be a place for reflection on whether our policing, mental health and other services can better safeguard us all, but launching cynical and ill-informed attacks on the asylum system won\u2019t help safeguard anybody.\u201d\n\n00:01:32 Clapham attacker last seen heading south, says Met police \u2013 video\n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said on Friday that the prime minister did not think \u201cforeign criminals should be able to stay in the country, putting the public at risk\u201d.\n\nThe government had been behind \u201cthe strongest legislation ever introduced\u201d, he added, citing the Nationality and Borders Act and Illegal Migration Act.\n\nCaseworkers were trained to work through any issues, Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said when pressed on whether individuals were attempting to pretend to convert to Christianity to exploit a loophole.\n\nThe 35-year-old suspect is thought to have arrived in the UK from Afghanistan by lorry in 2016 and his initial asylum claim was rejected that year. It was rejected for a second time after he said he had become a Christian, which would have put him at risk if he had returned to Afghanistan.\n\nThe decision was overturned by a tribunal in 2020, having heard from a church witness who said they believed Ezedi had converted. By then, he had been convicted of sexual assault and exposure, received a 45-week suspended prison sentence and been placed on the sex offender register."}

The Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 the Biden White House\u2019s trademark legislative achievement, which revolved around green investments \u2013 was a major accomplishment. Still, the US is breaking new records for its production and export of fossil fuels, last year extracting more oil and gas than ever before. Even more worrying is just how tenuous the country\u2019s modest progress on the climate feels in advance of November\u2019s presidential election: Donald Trump continues to lead Joe Biden in just about every poll.\n\nHowever, at the very least, the Biden administration has set a bar for the scale of green investment that centre-left parties should undertake. The same can\u2019t be said of the Labour party, which has reportedly now scrapped its laudable \u00a328bn green spending pledge in favour of some bizarre fealty to its leadership\u2019s own strange idea of fiscal responsibility. So what can Labour learn from the Democratic president\u2019s approach?\n\nTo his great credit, Biden took seriously the need to win over progressive supporters of his main opponent in the Democratic primary in 2020. Bernie Sanders was an early adopter of the climate movement\u2019s calls for a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d, laying out an expansive $16tn plan to tackle global heating and inequality. Biden\u2019s $3.5tn Build Back Better agenda, produced with Sanders and his supporters in consultative roles, was decidedly not a green new deal. It did, however, reflect that platform\u2019s most valuable components, positing climate action as a job creator and driver of 21st-century economic dynamism. Inherent in that was a willingness to spend lots of money, fast, on the things that matter.\n\nAlmost as soon as Biden took office, however, climate advocates in the US watched the White House\u2019s already too modest jobs and climate agenda get whittled down to what eventually became the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s roughly $400bn in new spending on climate and environmental priorities. It\u2019s a shamefully slender programme, given how wealthy the US is, and its outsized historical responsibility for the climate crisis. But it\u2019s also the best we might have hoped for, given the political influence of a fossil fuel industry that\u2019s captured the Republican party virtually wholesale, along with key Democrats such as the West Virginia senator, Joe Manchin.\n\nWithout the idiosyncrasies that weakened US climate policy, why do some members of the Labour party seem so keen to negotiate against themselves? The party\u2019s \u00a328bn a year green prosperity plan has now been dropped, thanks to the political cowardice of people such as the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who was already distancing herself from the policy in an interview with LBC earlier this week. The Labour veteran and podcast host Ed Balls suggested the problem with the plan was the number attached to it \u2013 urging Starmer and Reeves to \u201cU-turn\u201d away from it, so as to project fiscal responsibility and deflect repeated attacks from the right that Starmer would raise taxes to fund it. The party establishment is clearly spooked by the spectre of rightwing attacks, as Labour\u2019s latest move so clearly shows.\n\nIf the US can offer any lessons about how to deal with a right wing yammering on about how green policies allegedly hurt \u201cordinary people\u201d while preaching painful austerity, it\u2019s that it won\u2019t give you a lick of credit for giving in to its ideas. Neither, moreover, will voters. The planet is even less forgiving. The costs of the climate crisis far outweigh the costs of acting on it. Under present policies, the climate crisis could cost the UK 3.3% of GDP a year by 2050. By 2100, that jumps to 7.4% of GDP a year; in today\u2019s terms, that would be about \u00a3168bn.\n\nLabour needn\u2019t look to the future, though, to make a straightforward case for going big on green spending. The Conservatives\u2019 long-running war on good climate policy has already made life more expensive for working-class Britons. David Cameron\u2019s bid to cut the \u201cgreen crap\u201d entailed doing away with a successful home insulation programme in 2013. And the average household could be paying gas bills of up to \u00a3400 lower if the Tories hadn\u2019t axed the energy price guarantee scheme.\n\nWhile Labour\u2019s green prosperity plan was designed with the Inflation Reduction Act in mind, there was an opportunity for Starmer to improve on it by emphasising the short-term benefits, such as the money households could save from national home insulation projects. Though it\u2019s a hot topic among wonkish types in the US, UK and other parts of Europe, very few people here could tell you what the Inflation Reduction Act actually is. As of last August \u2013 a year on from the act\u2019s passage \u2013 71% of US residents said they knew \u201clittle or nothing\u201d about it. Why is the White House\u2019s high-profile accomplishment so far from most Americans\u2019 minds? For one, the consultancy McKinsey has found that $216bn of the act\u2019s $394bn in climate and energy-related tax credits will flow to corporations. Meanwhile, many benefits, such as incentives for pricey items such as electric vehicles and solar panels, are completely inaccessible to lower-income people and renters, who account for about 36% of US households.\n\nDriving investment in low-carbon energy and technologies makes a lot of sense: green industries grew four times faster than the rest of the British economy in 2020-21. But courting private-sector investment in green industries above all else \u2013 a sadly salient critique of the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 threatens to leave voters in the dark about the benefits of climate action to their pockets. An active green industrial strategy should go hand in hand with an expansion of the public goods, services and planning capacities it will need to succeed. Upgrading public transit infrastructure and ensuring an abundant, affordable supply of low-carbon energy will be key to the success of the emerging green industries. More important, though, is that these can be the foundation on which Labour \u2013 should it ever choose to \u2013 builds both a broadly shared green prosperity and its electoral mandate for ever-stronger climate policies.\n\nThe last few years of climate policymaking in the US point to at least one clear conclusion: Reeves and those who pushed to kill Labour\u2019s green spending pledge are dead wrong. Labour should be sparing no expense on reducing emissions and improving livelihoods; if anything, \u00a328bn a year is much too little. If party top brass can summon even an ounce of political courage they\u2019ll make another U-turn away from disastrous, outdated economic orthodoxy and revive their more ambitious climate plans. Should that happen, the party can make voters acutely aware of the choice before them \u2013 to live a good, green life under Labour, or to let another Tory government take away more of their hard-earned money. Otherwise, the differences between Tory and Labour rule will keep getting harder and harder to spot."}

The country faces a choice: decline, as businesses and financial investors go elsewhere to find welcoming governments and the regulations, equipment and skills they seek; or investment in the future.\n\nThat is the context in which the decision by the Labour party\u2019s leadership to abandon the longstanding pledge of investing \u00a328bn a year in a low-carbon industrial strategy must be seen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s economically illiterate [to scrap the spending pledge],\u201d said Richard Murphy, a professor of accounting at Sheffield University. \u201cAny person who has done the most basic undergraduate economics knows that you have to invest to get growth.\u201d\n\nLow-carbon investment is necessary to meet the UK\u2019s legally binding target of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, but the benefits go far beyond that. Clean energy is cheaper than fossil fuels, increases self-sufficiency and national security by making the UK less dependent on volatile imports of oil and gas, generates green jobs, and reduces air pollution.\n\nThe push for a low-carbon economy also has far broader benefits: people will see lower energy bills, warmer and less damp homes, and better health as a result of that, as well as an increase in active transport and green spaces from low-carbon cities.\n\nMike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cGreen investment is essential for reducing our energy bills, cutting emissions, creating long-term jobs and boosting business opportunities. Cold, damp homes are having a huge impact on people\u2019s health and wellbeing, as millions struggle to pay the soaring cost of energy bills this winter.\u201d\n\nBut after more than a decade of chronic underinvestment, the UK needs somewhere between about \u00a326bn and \u00a330bn a year in public investment to achieve those aims, according to studies. The public money would attract private sector investment, probably enough to triple the amount invested, and would quickly pay off in economic growth and lower bills, as well as increased tax revenues.\n\n\u201cThe fiscal multiplier [by which public investment stimulates growth] is a reality,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cIt also generates income in tax revenues.\u201d\n\nOther countries, such as the US, China and EU member states, are seizing the opportunities for low-carbon growth. Dr Anupama Sen, the head of policy engagement at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at Oxford University, said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see the Labour party water down this flagship policy due to short-term political pressures, at such a crucial time for climate action and leadership, especially with other countries racing to prepare their economies for the imminent green energy transition. It would be better to stand firm and make the case for this level of investment, which is that it would reduce our emissions and shield against increasingly volatile energy prices to give us genuine energy security.\u201d\n\nLabour has said that its underlying plans to decarbonise the power sector by 2030 and hit the UK\u2019s carbon reduction targets, through measures such as home insulation and improving transport, remain unchanged. The party has not said how much it plans to invest, however, or where the cash necessary to achieve these goals will come from.\n\nThat is not good enough for many supporters of a low-carbon economy. The leftwing campaign group Labour for a Green New Deal said: \u201cWithout the \u00a328bn green investment fund, the future of Britain is bleak. This promise, if kept, could have not only revitalised the green economy after 14 years of Tory failure, but put the UK on the front line of green innovation, leading the world in climate technologies and solutions.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

The Tories have not outlined how much they would spend, and are reluctant to say how much public money has been invested in total in recent years. But the party is keen to boast of \u00a3200bn in private-sector investment in low-carbon efforts in the UK since 2010, and \u00a330bn of additional private investment, most of it in offshore wind, announced since last September, when Rishi Sunak made his U-turns on net-zero policy.\n\nThat investment had been achieved by setting out \u201croadmaps\u201d for a direction of travel, rather than investing large sums of public money, a party adviser told the Guardian.\n\nBut these investments were largely the result of past policies that had since lapsed or stagnated, according to Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank. \u201cThe government is living off its past glories. The policies that brought in funding for offshore wind were set a decade and more ago. And with its constant chopping and changing on net zero and industrial strategy, the government can hardly boast of setting a roadmap,\u201d he said. \u201cThe private sector is crying out for more consistency.\u201d\n\nRebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, pointed to the accompanying failures of the government. \u201cThe Conservative government has been responsible for crumbling public services, a tanking economy, sewage in our rivers and seas \u2013 the list goes on. To fix the damage the government has caused, the UK urgently needs a bold green industrial strategy that will create millions of jobs, grow our flailing economy, ease pressure on the NHS, and help the cost of living and climate crises all at the same time.\u201d\n\nWithout investment in a low-carbon future, the future is likely to be \u201cbleak, barren, hopeless and devastated\u201d, according to Murphy. \u201cThe scale of regret is going to be phenomenal.\u201d"}

By which I mean, I have an active group chat. It began 1o years ago as a casual work chat, but we message every day. Recently, one of us shared a link to a news story about seven friends in their 30s who pooled resources to build their dream home. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this, right?\u201d I responded, half-joking, but the seed had been planted. Why would I peg my future to a life partner I don\u2019t have yet, rather than the friends I\u2019ve had longest?\n\nAlmost four years after Covid imposed long-term social isolation, many of us are rethinking the value of friendship, including Gyan Yankovich, the author of Just Friends. \u201cSo many of the things we do and milestones we celebrate revolve around the idea that the nuclear family and marriage should be valued above all else,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThe way society is set up doesn\u2019t make prioritizing friendship easy.\u201d\n\nI had long held some vague expectation that I would eventually have a life partner and be \u201cset\u201d, whatever that means. But I\u2019m now in my late 30s and rapidly reconsidering. Divorce rates in the US have decreased slightly in the last 10 years \u2013 but so have marriage rates. Culturally, we are at our most individualized, self-optimized and self-employed.\n\nI also have the fewest friends I have ever had \u2013 intentionally \u2013 and not just because of my hermetic tendencies. I prefer to invest my time wholeheartedly in mutually enriching friendships. This isn\u2019t unusual: according to a joint study by Oxford and Aalto University, your social network is at its broadest when you\u2019re 25, on average, after which it pares down to fewer but closer connections, and making new friends becomes more challenging.\n\nBefore my 30s, I\u2019d float between friends as each found a romantic relationship that dominated their focus \u2013 then we\u2019d drift back together after they broke up. This cycle of placeholder companionship made me a bit apathetic about friendships until I realized I didn\u2019t have a go-to name for an emergency contact.\n\nSo I made a concerted effort to invest in my support system. I reached out to old friends to catch up. I said yes to their invitations. I opened up to them about my insecurities. I even asked some of them for help (previously unthinkable, as someone who once said \u201cno worries!\u201d to a packed subway after I\u2019d fainted). Socializing requires a lot of energy, but it always feels satisfying.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018It\u2019s important to build a future with someone in the same way we\u2019ve normalized obligation between people who are married or related by blood.\u2019 Photograph: Yasser Chalid/Getty Images\n\nOur hyperconnected culture has resulted in massive social alienation, with loneliness now a health epidemic. Social isolation increases the risk of early death from all causes. Research states that a lack of social connection is as harmful as smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day. It\u2019s not just a Covid-era development; loneliness has been on the rise for the last 20 years, especially since smartphones became ubiquitous.\n\nSocial media can enable connection, says Irene Levine, a psychologist and the author of Best Friends Forever: Surviving a Breakup with Your Best Friend. However, she warns that digital relations are not a substitute for \u201cface-to-face, hip-to-hip get-togethers when two friends can leisurely connect and share \u2013 even spending time together saying nothing. Online friends can\u2019t provide the type of caring and support from friends who live close by.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Yankovich says she now thinks a sense of obligation is an important element of maintaining friendships \u2013 in a good way. \u201cI\u2019d always thought of obligation as something with a somewhat negative connotation, usually closely tied to family,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to show up, care, protect and build a future with someone in the same way we\u2019ve normalized obligation between people who are married or related by blood.\u201d\n\nIn Okinawa, Japan, this concept lives in moai, or small groups of lifelong friends (the word translates loosely to \u201cmeet for a common purpose\u201d). Moai originated centuries ago as a means of local financial support; friends might contribute money to a communal safety net for anyone in the group who needed, say, medical expenses or home repairs. These days, the concept has expanded to social support systems, including regular social activities with friends. Okinawa is considered one of the world\u2019s blue zones \u2013 areas with high concentrations of healthy people living into their 100s \u2013 and moai are considered a significant contributor to this longevity.\n\n\u201cFriends encourage us to live healthier lives and are the first to let us know when we need to get help, whether it is from a doctor or therapist,\u201d says Levine, who added that friendships can often be overlooked due to demanding jobs, caregiving and busy modern lives. \u201cYet it may be just as important to nurture these relationships as it is to exercise, eat nutritious foods and get a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d\n\nOne study concluded that people judged a hill to be less steep when climbing it with a friend compared to going it alone\n\nQuality friendships have physiological effects. Talking to supportive friends can keep blood pressure reactivity lower, and having a friend present during a difficult task helps to reduce cardiovascular reactivity. One study concluded that people judged a hill to be less steep when climbing it with a friend compared to going it alone.\n\nClose friendships are a critical factor in not just longevity, but also in making those lived years fulfilling. \u201cI used to be super isolated due to illness in my 20s, and I\u2019ve realized that being around others you care about helps foster your sense of self because when you\u2019re alone you\u2019re just stuck spiraling within your own created reality that isn\u2019t necessarily true,\u201d Alex, 33, from Brooklyn says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been able to develop a more full understanding of who I am in all of the different roles I can exist in through deep, intentional friendships.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Friends encourage us to live healthier lives and are the first to let us know when we need to get help.\u2019 Photograph: Daly and Newton/Getty Images\n\nFulfilling friendships require, at minimum, spending time together consistently, which can be difficult. Our needs and responsibilities change as we age. Sometimes we outgrow friendships, especially with big life changes like starting a family. \u201cHaving a baby really changed things in my friendships,\u201d Kara Nesvig, a 34-year-old from Minneapolis, tells me. Some friends showed up for support, and some disappeared. She was able to bond even more closely with others: \u201cI was fortunate enough to develop a super-tight friendship with three former co-workers because we were all pregnant at the same time. That has been one of the most beautiful surprises of my friendship journey.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t all wait for life-altering events to determine who our real friends are. It might be more realistic to invest in our present relationships. That might mean something as simple as picking up the phone more often, or more planning and effort, like offering to pick up a friend\u2019s kid from school or accompanying them to a medical appointment.\n\nOr we can decide to invest in seeking out new friendships. Yankovich says we often think meaningful friendships require years of knowing a person. But I\u2019m not the same person I was in school, or even in 2020. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why a new friend can\u2019t come to know us \u2013 the current iteration of us, at least \u2013 just as well,\u201d says Yankovich.\n\nLacking legal or blood ties, friendships often get overshadowed by our marriages and biological relationships (despite sometimes outlasting them). But there\u2019s no good reason friendships shouldn\u2019t receive as much consideration as those bonds. \u201cOne of the things I was most nervous about when writing about why we should prioritize friendship was that I\u2019d be judged as someone who didn\u2019t love their partner (I do) or who wasn\u2019t close to their family (I am),\u201d Yankovich says. \u201cWhen people are permitted to admit that their friends are just as important to their happiness as their kids, partners and parents, most people will.\u201d"}

Instead, a spokesperson for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland said, the monkey was back on his normal fare of primate pellets, vegetables and leaves, and none the worse for his adventure.\n\nHonshu\u2019s bold escape, after he scaled the perimeter fence of his enclosure last Sunday, may have brought him brief global celebrity, but while Biaza, the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums, says incidents like this are \u201cvery rare\u201d, zoo escapes are perhaps not quite as unusual as one might expect.\n\nEven while the world\u2019s media were focused on finding Honshu, for instance, zoo authorities at the opposite end of Britain have been hunting their own missing animal. Dartmoor zoo in Devon confirmed two weeks ago that Malu, a Palawan binturong \u2013 a threatened subspecies related to the civet \u2013 was missing from his enclosure, amid reports that he had not been seen since Christmas. While the nocturnal animal is not dangerous, according to the zoo, visitors have been advised not to approach him.\n\nEarlier in January, a rainbow lorikeet escaped its aviary at Colchester zoo in Essex by hitching a ride on a member of the public as they left the walk-through enclosure; experts have been debating whether it could survive in the wild.\n\nLast year in the UK there were escapes of a red panda from Newquay zoo in Cornwall in May (later recaptured at a greengrocer\u2019s after being spotted \u201cambling\u201d down a street); a 1.2-metre tegu lizard from a Cumbrian petting zoo in June (the public were warned it \u201ccan run like a T Rex\u201d), and a pelican from Blackpool zoo in August (blown away after being spooked by a group of seagulls).\n\nThat same month, an unidentified monkey fled its enclosure in Paignton zoo in Devon (to be later found among the rhinos after visitors to the zoo were put in lockdown), while in September three yellow parrots escaped from the Wild zoological park in the West Midlands (blown out of the grounds by a strong gust of wind).\n\nSome animal welfare campaigners suggest there may be many more. \u201cZoos only have to announce or declare an animal has escaped to the local licensing authority as the animal leaves the perimeter of the zoo,\u201d said Chris Lewis, the captivity research officer at the Born Free Foundation. An animal that gets out of its enclosure but stays within the zoo\u2019s confines need only be recorded internally, he said. \u201cSo the number of escapes that actually occur is probably much higher than [we know about].\u201d\n\nMore serious incidents are not an everyday occurrence, but are far from unknown. Incidents in recent years have included the lynx that escaped Borth zoo in west Wales in 2017 and was later shot dead in a caravan park, and the snow leopard that got out of Dudley zoo the following year, which suffered the same fate. Two brown bears were shot dead at Whipsnade zoo in 2021 after using a fallen tree to get into the neighbouring boar enclosure. Most seriously, keeper Sarah McClay was mauled to death by a Sumatran tiger at a Cumbrian animal park in 2013.\n\nThat zoo was later heavily fined, and Biaza\u2019s chief executive, Jo Judge, insists that British zoos conform to some of the highest standards in the world and prepare very carefully for the chance escape of an animal.\n\n\u201cAll [institutions] that have a zoo licence are legally required to have procedures in place to ensure that they prevent escapes where possible, and that they are prepared for dealing with escapes, in those very rare occasions if they do happen,\u201d she said. The procedures included drills four times a year training for escapes of different types of species. \u201cObviously, it would be very different if a fish escaped from a tank, as opposed to the macaque in this instance, and they have to be prepared for all eventualities.\u201d\n\nDepending on the kinds of species they keep, zoos will have staff who are trained in firing tranquilliser darts, and possibly also in firearms, Judge said. \u201cIf they have an animal that could be a danger to life, then it\u2019s a legal requirement that they have firearms on site, and that they have people trained to use them.\n\n\u201cSo although it\u2019s really rare, everyone takes it incredibly seriously.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the seriousness of the event, however, every zoo escape represents a failure of some kind, and Samantha Ward, associate professor of zoo animal welfare at Nottingham Trent University, said there would be lessons to be learned from this week\u2019s events.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest aspects at the moment for zoo design is incorporating interaction between humans and animals. These days, we\u2019re trying to improve and increase the [ways] that people can feel connected to the animals. This means that you might reduce the amount of fencing or you will have different viewpoints, which then allow a different kind of interaction with the animals within the enclosures.\n\n\u201cAnd I think sometimes it might be that the focus on what the visitors need is maybe [placed] higher than the safety or the security side of things.\u201d\n\nAs well as enclosure design, there will be questions about the social dynamics in the animal\u2019s enclosure, and whether it has been pushed out from the group; in Honshu\u2019s case, according to the animal park, he will be gradually introduced to the other sub-adult males before being reintroduced to the whole group.\n\nCaptivity may have called for Honshu the macaque, but sometimes an animal does not only flee a zoo, but thrives. By coincidence, Friday marked the anniversary of the escape from Central Park zoo in New York of Flaco the Eurasian eagle owl.\n\nFor more than a week after vandals first cut a hole in his enclosure and he escaped, local birders and zoo authorities chased the huge owl around Manhattan, attempting to lure him back. Eventually, however, they realised he had taught himself to hunt for rats, and decided to leave him to it.\n\nA year on, Flaco may well be the only Eurasian eagle owl living in the wild in the Americas, but he\u2019s doing just fine \u2013 and occasionally popping up on apartment windowsills to peer at the humans within."}

Two weeks later police found her in Houston\u2019s red-light district.\n\n\u201c[When she came home] she started to talk more about what they had done to her,\u201d says Cory. \u201cHorror stories were coming out of my baby\u2019s mouth of what she was forced to do.\u201d\n\nCory says Kristen came back to her family a different person from the child they had known: traumatised, frightened and angry.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018I have searched for my daughter in some really dark places,\u2019 says Robyn Cory. \u2018We are doing DNA tests of bodies that match her description.\u2019 Photograph: Tola Olawale/The Guardian\n\nIn 2020, aided by information Kristen gave to the police, one of her traffickers, Aryion Jackson, was handed a 27-year prison sentence for trafficking children into sexual exploitation. Since then another three people, including Jackson\u2019s mother, have also been sentenced.\n\nCourt documents from his trial detail what Jackson put his victims through. According to the papers, he and his associates kept up to 12 women and girls in a building in Houston known as a \u201ctrap house\u201d, where they were forced into commercial sex work for between $100 and $300 a time.\n\n\u201c[Jackson] threatened to kill/harm the women/minors or their families if they left him,\u201d states one document. \u201c[Jackson] did not provide food for the women/minors but regularly provided them with drugs to keep them working.\u201d\n\nDuring his trial, prosecutors also described how Jackson and his co-conspirators had used Instagram to groom and recruit children. Cory says Kristen told police and prosecutors that her traffickers had also used Instagram and escort websites to advertise and sell her for sex.\n\n\u201cShe said they had people in the house controlling their social media and setting up dates for them,\u201d claims Cory.\n\nFive months after Kristen was trafficked, she disappeared for a second time. Her family have not seen her since then.\n\n\u201cKristen told us, \u2018They\u2019re coming to kill you all if I don\u2019t go \u2013 I have to go back.

The loss of power also temporarily disrupted service on a key subway line and shut off water.

As a result, many have called for Covid jabs to be made privately available, just as flu jabs are, to offer protection against both Covid and long Covid.\n\nPharmadoctor said the initial vaccine on offer would be the updated Novavax jab, which targets the Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.\n\n\u201cBut as more vaccines become licensed for use in the private market, they will be added into the service,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Novavax jab is a protein-based vaccine that uses more established technology than some other Covid vaccinations, meaning it may be more acceptable to some who have concerns over newer types of vaccine based on mRNA or adenovirus platforms \u2013 such as the Pfizer/BioNTech or AstraZeneca Covid jabs respectively.\n\nProf Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, said the version that is to be given privately protects against Omicron variants including the currently circulating JN.1 variant. But he added: \u201cIt is likely that the mRNA-based vaccines will also be available privately soon.\u201d\n\nWhile some have raised concerns about poor uptake of recent booster jabs among some of those eligible for the free jabs, it seems pharmacists are already experiencing demand for the paid-for service.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And just before plunging to her death from a high-rise window, Sex and the City\u2019s (fictional) party girl Lexi Featherston ranted about how everything started to go wrong in New York after they banned smoking in bars.\n\nThis week, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, longtime cool girl of downtown Manhattan, added another theory to the list. While promoting the new Ryan Murphy series Feud: Capote and the Swans, Sevigny told Rolling Stone that it\u2019s all dogs\u2019 fault.\n\n\u201cThe athleisure and the dogs are taking over, and that\u2019s really unfortunate,\u201d Sevigny said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s in Lululemon and has a fucking dog and it\u2019s driving me crazy. I\u2019m sorry, dog lovers. There are too many of you.\u201d\n\nWhat do New York\u2019s dog owners have to say about this? In Brooklyn\u2019s Maria Hernandez park on Thursday, where a popular dog run just received approval for a $300,000 renovation (what budget crisis?), pup parents shrugged off Sevigny\u2019s comments.\n\nView image in fullscreen Abby Walsh and her dog Calypso. Photograph: The Guardian\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Lululemon now, so this is a perfect question for me,\u201d said Abby Walsh, an illustrator out walking her ageing chihuahua Calypso. \u201cThere is definitely a lack of respect from dog owners who keep their dogs off-leash or don\u2019t properly train them. I find that this usually happens in more wealthier neighborhoods, but then the people who get penalized for their animals are typically not those white, Lululemon girls.\u201d\n\nNearby, a woman named Stefanie played fetch with her pit bull Bebe, who was off-leash on a soccer turf where dogs are not allowed to play. \u201cDog owners are a specific category of annoying person,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m annoying, to some degree, though it\u2019s my responsibility to handle my dog.

He said that he could imagine wealthier spots, such as Sevigny\u2019s former homes in the East Village and Park Slope, being bastions of entitled owners.\n\n\u201cIf I lived Chloe\u2019s life, where she was walking around with other wealthy people basically being upper-class Karens having a fit when their dogs aren\u2019t allowed at yoga, then I might understand,\u201d he said. \u201cHer world is very small if dogs are what she complains about the most.

New Yorkers face record-high rents and an ever-soaring cost of living. Mayor Eric Adams slashed the city\u2019s budgets, affecting schools, libraries, sanitation and more. Walk through just about any public park in Manhattan and you\u2019re bound to run into a twentysomething with a mini microphone asking if you\u2019ll answer a few questions for a TikTok video. Surely all of those examples are far worse than canine companions.\n\nAcross the East River in downtown Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park, the setting for Sevigny\u2019s breakout role in the coming-of-age-on-the-streets drama Kids, Isabella Mino spent her morning at the dog park with Nirvana, a pit bull mix with striking blue eyes and a peaceful demeanor worthy of her name. Mino took issue with Sevigny\u2019s assumption that all New York dog owners were rich or could afford Lululemon, where yoga pants can cost more than $100.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s talking about the 1%, but that\u2019s not me and it\u2019s not a lot of people,\u201d Mino said. \u201cOwning a dog doesn\u2019t have to do with money, it has to do with love. New York can be a very lonely city, and looking for humans to love is not always easy.

That\u2019s this bullshit illusion of this city, that you have to struggle to make it.

You can\u2019t imagine how emotional they were. I\u2019ve always had some supporters within the art world but at the same time have had some people who were so against me, which was very upsetting. You\u2019re having to take on this extraordinary negativity and a kind of anger. It has taken me literally years to find a way of talking about them that liberated me from their \u2026 well, I can\u2019t even find the words to describe what they were doing.\u201d\n\nPoncelet was making her own carpets by collaging remnants bought from carpet shops. She has come to see them as a \u201crepresentation of Britain\u201d, raising questions about class and colonialism. \u201cThe British have been aesthetic thieves as well as every other kind of thief you can think of,\u201d she says. \u201cThese carpets represent a place in society, but also things we\u2019ve taken from other cultures. They are like an extraordinary social document.\u201d\n\nDid ordinary gallery-goers, not the \u201cart establishment\u201d, like Poncelet\u2019s carpets? \u201cThey did,\u201d she replies. \u201cThey saw them as a chance to reminisce and talk about their own experiences in life \u2013 and children loved them.

It might have been different if she had been a man. Or stuck to one thing, instead of being an artist impossible to pigeonhole.\n\nInstead, she has been working largely under the radar for 50 years; a star to some and an inspiration to many. Her work is in collections including Tate, the Stedeljk Museum in Amsterdam and MoMA in New York but she has never really had her \u201cmoment\u201d until, it is hoped, now.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rug reference: a view of Poncelet\u2019s retrospective at Mima Photograph: Jason Hynes\n\nMima in Middlesbrough has opened a show surveying Poncelet\u2019s diverse career from her early days as a ceramicist and taking in her forays into sculpture, textiles, wallpapers, paintings and public art. It is a big deal for her but also a huge moment for the gallery, which is staging the show after Poncelet won the \u00a3100,000 Freelands award in 2021.\n\nThe prize was created in 2016 to enable a UK arts organisation to present an exhibition by a female artist who \u201cmay not yet have received the acclaim or public recognition that her work deserves\u201d. Poncelet is unquestionably in that category, says Mima\u2019s artistic director Elinor Morgan who has been working with the artist on the exhibition for the last two and a half years.\n\nIt is, Morgan says, \u201cphenomenal to have such a kind of stateswoman of contemporary art\u201d as Poncelet at Mima and the generous prize money allows the gallery to do things it would normally not be able to afford.\n\nThe exhibition itself will include some of Poncelet\u2019s earliest ceramics \u2013 bone china pots which weigh almost nothing \u2013 as well as newly commissioned works made after the artist\u2019s hours and hours wandering the streets of Middlesbrough. They include new wallpapers in the lifts and on a huge swathe of a gallery wall.\n\nPoncelet thinks the British have an odd attitude to wallpaper, but she loves it. \u201cMy background isn\u2019t entirely English and we always went abroad in the summer and I fell in love with those mad French hotels where everything is wallpapered, including the ceiling. There would be a dresser and even the dresser would have it. So I always think of wallpaper as like a space for your imagination. I love the idea that you create a different kind of imagined space.\u201d\n\nPoncelet was born in Belgium and moved to England as a young child, studying at Wolverhampton College of Art before going on to the Royal College of Art, which was liberating because of the freedom she was allowed. \u201cIt was glorious,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything is accountable now, isn\u2019t it? Everything has a form which has to be filled in.\n\nView image in fullscreen Her sculpture period: Bronze with Hair, 1988. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist.

One memorably strange early exhibition experience was being asked by the furniture store Heal\u2019s to show work on its shopfloor.\n\n\u201cThey put me in the ceramics area with the plates and the cups and saucers,\u201d said Poncelet. \u201cPeople were totally mystified. They thought, what on earth are these objects and why are they so expensive?\u201d\n\nAfter she abandoned ceramics she turned to sculpture but never achieved the success of her mostly male peers in the 1980s new British sculpture movement, including her then husband Richard Deacon.\n\nThe reasons why Poncelet has never got the recognition she deserves are varied and by her own cheerful admission, she makes it difficult for people to get a handle on her. She has moved from thing to thing and it\u2019s sometimes difficult to join the dots. As well as ceramics, sculpture and wallpaper, her career has included watercolour painting, oil painting, weaving, complicated photomontages \u2013 \u201cI loved Snappy Snaps\u201d \u2013 and, partly to earn a crust, teaching and public art commissions.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Why are these so expensive?\u2019 Bone China Vessel, c.1975 with Eliptical Form with Half Foot, 1976.

Neither Poncelet nor Mima can talk about that yet, they say, so what it might involve is anyone\u2019s guess. In the past she has created a terrazzo dado for an Edinburgh international festival building and decorative vinyl for windows at Oxford\u2019s John Radcliffe heart centre. Her most eye-popping public art work \u2013 and one which Morgan says turned her into a total \u201cfangirl\u201d \u2013 was Poncelet\u2019s wrapping of an entire building next to Edgware tube station in London in 2012.\n\nMorgan says Poncelet\u2019s diversity of output was one reason she was not the famous name she deserved to be. \u201cThe infrastructures of the art world, academic and commercial and curatorial, have formed around artists who maybe have a signature medium or way of working,\u201d she says. That and the \u201cmyth of the male, solo genius artist\u201d.\n\nPoncelet these days divides her time between London and south Wales where her partner, former gallerist Anthony Stokes, lives. She agrees that her career would have been different if she had been a man. But she is not bitter.\n\n\u201cThere is always that but it doesn\u2019t particularly bother me. I just think it\u2019s a fact of life and I\u2019ve had such an interesting life that I can\u2019t sit here weeping about it. Maybe it would have been less interesting. Maybe somebody would have tidied me up. Maybe somebody would have tried to manage me. Maybe this is my moment. Because I\u2019m older.\u201d"}
