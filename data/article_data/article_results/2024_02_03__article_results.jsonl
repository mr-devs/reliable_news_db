He also talked about why he believes few college football players have gotten true endorsement deals for their names, images and likenesses (NIL).\n\nWhat did Deion Sanders say about roster building?\n\nSanders said he likes recruiting sophomores who transferred in instead of bringing in a bunch of freshmen. His recruiting class for 2024 includes only six freshmen and nearly 25 transfer players.\n\n\u201cWhen you inherited a roster like we inherited a roster, you can\u2019t deal with high school kids that much, because it takes them probably a couple of years to develop (and) you\u2019ll be fired in a couple years,\u201d Sanders told the students. \u201cYou don\u2019t have that kind of time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s become the king of the transfer portal, bringing in 47 scholarship players from other four-year colleges last year. Only a few freshmen played last year in Sanders\u2019 first season at Colorado, when the Buffaloes finished 4-8. If the freshmen he does recruit don\u2019t play right away, Sanders noted those players then might get in the transfer portal to play somewhere else.\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019d rather do is go get a sophomore in college \u2026 that understands the bus stops, understands what time class starts\u2026 And we don\u2019t have to worry about them introducing themselves to the collegiate game,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBecause if you load your roster up with a bunch of freshmen, you\u2019re in for a heckuva season\u2026 It\u2019s not gonna be good. And when you have a pro kind of quarterback, you can\u2019t give him youngsters to work with. It\u2019s gonna be chaotic.\u201d\n\nDeion Sanders says Colorado might have top picks in 2025 NFL draft\n\nSanders also mentioned how lots of NFL scouts will be visiting Boulder this year and said his quarterback son Shedeur and two-way player Travis Hunter might be the top two overall picks in the draft next year.\n\n\u201cWe got, proposedly, the first and second pick of the whole draft, Sheduer and Travis, so every NFL scout is coming, but they\u2019re not just gonna come for that, because I want them to see the smorgasbord of players that we have and the operation that we have,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSocial branding seminar\n\nSanders is often followed by cameras that document his program for three main YouTube channels, including Well Off Media, which is run by his son Deion Jr. But those who edit those videos know they better be careful and not include footage that might make Sanders look bad. As an example, he told a story about how he used the term \u201cwife beater\u201d recently to describe a tank-top shirt and didn\u2019t want it included in one of the videos.\n\nHe also told a story about how freshman offensive lineman Jordan Seaton recently posted a video in which the \u201dwhole rap song was profanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, 'Big fella, not today,\u2019\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\u201cI apologize coach; it won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Seaton replied, according to Sanders.\n\nSanders\u2019 son Deion Jr. calls his father the \u201cInstagram police.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to teach them, because they don\u2019t know any better,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI said, Jordan, 'You\u2019re trying to brand yourself. The first thing people do is go through your social media.\u2019\u201d\n\nSchooling on NIL\n\nNIL became legal in 2021, but now NIL issues are roiling college sports. Sanders said he wouldn\u2019t even call it NIL because he believes it\u2019s not really NIL, which he considers to be an endorsement deal between a company and a player. Instead, he said NIL collectives are stepping in to pay players by passing around a collection plate to school boosters and then dividing the pot with \u00ad\u00adplayers.\n\n\u201cSince I got time today, I want you (to) tell me how many players in college football that you\u2019ve seen in commercials,\u201d Sanders said to the students.\n\nThe students came up with five names, including his sons Shedeur and Shilo Sanders.\n\n\u201cAll these college athletes and you\u2019ve named five people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not NIL. This is not the day of NIL. That\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be, but it\u2019s collectives and that\u2019s where it went wrong.\u201d\n\nSanders said major companies generally aren't going to be interested in signing sponsorship deals with many college kids because they\u2019re unproven and companies don\u2019t want to risk damaging the company brand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of everybody in the country talking about NIL,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s not NIL.\u201d\n\nSeizing the moment at CU Boulder\n\nSanders also gave some advice: Seize your moment.\n\n\u201cThe reason you know (NBA great) Michael Jordan is because when it came down to that moment, he seized it,\u201d Sanders told the students. \u201cThe reason we know (singer) Taylor Swift or whoever you love and adore out there right now, is because when she get that mic in her hand, what she do? She delivers.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have a moment to deliver and to go get it, and to just catapult yourself up to another level. What you gonna do with your moment? The only reason I\u2019m standing in front of you today is because I have seized a multitude of my moments. And I\u2019m still seizing.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: USA TODAY Sports' Brent Schrotenboer is also scheduled to speak to this class this semester.\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer on X: @Schrotenboer.

(AP) \u2013 Freshman JuJu Watkins scored a Southern California-record 51 points \u2013 the most in NCAA women\u2019s basketball this season \u2013 and the 15th-ranked Trojans upset No. 3 Stanford 67-58 on Friday night.\n\nWatkins hit a key 3 with 3:10 remaining and four free throws over the final 18 seconds to break the previous USC scoring mark of 50 set by Cherie Nelson against California on March 11, 1989. Watkins hit six 3-pointers to help the Trojans (15-4, 5-4) send the Cardinal (19-3, 8-2) to their first home loss of the season.\n\nWatkins had 25 by halftime and finished 14 for 26 from the floor. Her 3 with 5:52 left in the third put her at 37 and USC ahead 43-35 \u2013 giving her more points than Stanford had total. Watkins came in averaging 25.8 points and Hall of Fame Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer turned to freshman Courtney Ogden to try stopping her.\n\nStanford star Cameron Brink had 19 points, 15 rebounds and eight blocked shots \u2013 swatting six shots in the first half. Her layup with 5:36 left pulled Stanford within six and she converted two free throws at 4:02 that made it 54-50 before Watkins took over once more.\n\nAnd what a thrilling way for these two teams to begin the final weekend of the L.A. schools coming to the Bay Area for Pac-12 play before their move to the Big Ten. USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb returns to Berkeley on Sunday to face her former Cal program.\n\nKiki Iriafen contributed 16 points and nine rebounds for the Cardinal, who lost for the first time in five games since a 71-59 defeat at Colorado on Jan. 14.\n\nMcKenzie Forbes added 12 points for USC, which had lost three of four since beating UCLA on Jan. 14.\n\nUSC missed six straight shots and had a scoring drought of 4:31 before Watkins\u2019 late 3 that was reviewed and stood. The Trojans went on a 6-0 run late in the third as Stanford looked rushed and out of sorts during a 1-for-8 shooting stretch.\n\nBoth teams endured long scoring droughts.\n\nUSC went 5 minutes, 44 seconds between baskets in the first quarter \u2013 missing nine straight shots during a 1-for-11 stretch before Watkins connected on a jumper with 2:14 left in the opening period.\n\nWatkins got on a roll from there, scoring 25 of her team\u2019s first 31 points and shooting 9 for 13 after starting 1 for 5.\n\nStanford missed its final five shots of the first half spanning the closing 4 minutes and committed three turnovers for a 31-all tie at intermission as USC finished on a 6-0 burst.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nUSC: Watkins outscored Stanford herself in the third quarter, 15-11. \u2026 The Trojans had lost the previous 19 meetings on Stanford\u2019s home floor in Maples Pavilion dating to a 62-59 victory on March 1, 2001.\n\nStanford: Dating to 1999-2000, the most points one player had scored against Stanford was Kelsey Plum\u2019s 44 for Washington on Jan. 29, 2017, but Stanford rallied back from 18 points to win 72-68 in Seattle. \u2026 This marked only the third time Stanford faced a ranked USC team since 1995-96, and first time with the Trojans in the top 15 since Stanford\u2019s 80-50 home win against No. 6 USC on Feb. 24, 1994.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUSC: At California on Sunday.\n\nStanford: Hosts No. 8 UCLA on Sunday."}

And we certainly wouldn\u2019t have had such a wonderful time making it. Every minute with him - on set and off - was pure joy.\"\n\nThe photos included frames of the famed \"Predator\" handshake between the two action stars that showed their respective bulging biceps \u2014 part greeting, part muscle competition.\n\nWeathers \"was the type of friend who pushes you to be your best just to keep up with him,\" Schwarzenegger wrote. \"I\u2019ll miss him, and my thoughts are with his family.\""}

Joki\u0107 is second in the league in player efficiency rating (PER) at 31.9 and we've seen what this team can do in the postseason.\n\nMilwaukee made the surprising move to fire coach Adrian Griffin and ultimately replace him with Doc Rivers. The Bucks have one of the best offenses in the league and they're the only team in the league with multiple All-Star starters. Two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo is enjoying the best shooting season of his career. If Rivers can get more out of one of the best starting lineups in the league by net rating (+16.0), they'll be in great shape ahead of the All-Star break.\n\nStanding ovation:Damian Lillard cheered in his return to Portland after offseason trade to the Bucks\n\nThe Clippers are 14-3 since Christmas and that run's pushed them up to third in the Western Conference ahead of their road matchup with the Detroit Pistons. Paul George and Kawhi Leonard made the All-Star team once again and power the best five-man lineup with at least 600 possessions, per Cleaning the Glass data. That duo along with James Harden, Terance Mann, and Ivica Zubac have a +16.4 net rating.\n\nPhoenix is also finding its stride after Christmas. A loss to the Dallas Mavericks that night dropped the team to 14-15. Since then, the Suns are 14-5 and working their way up the Western Conference standings. All-Stars Devin Booker and Kevin Durant are one of the highest scoring tandems in the league and Phoenix is up to eighth in the league in offensive rating. Even Grayson Allen is playing the best basketball of his career this season.\n\nThe Timberwolves won 42 games last season and are on pace to match that win total by the end of February. Minnesota leads the league in defensive rating powered by Rudy Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns, the top two players in defensive win shares this season. Four of the top 10 players in defensive rating in the NBA are Timberwolves: Gobert (first), Naz Reid (third), Towns (fifth), and Kyle Anderson (ninth). With Towns and Anthony Edwards leading the way on offense, Minnesota has a formula to stay atop up the Western Conference.\n\nHall of Famer calls out school:Gary Payton rips California's Lincoln University, where he is men's basketball coach\n\nOklahoma City's the second-youngest team in the NBA this season but hardly playing like it. All-Star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leads the league in steals per game (2.2) and offensive win shares (7.3). He's third in the NBA in PER this season and is the focal point of the fourth-highest scoring team in the league. Chet Holmgren's third in the league in blocks, too, to give Oklahoma City a solid core along with Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams. They're young and inexperienced in the postseason but too talented to overlook.\n\nReigning NBA MVP Joel Embiid leads the league in scoring once again and ranks eighth in defensive rating (109.0) but suffered a knee injury in the 76ers' loss to the Golden State Warriors. The team is weighing treatment options after an MRI confirmed an injury to Embiid's meniscus. With him out potentially for an extended period, the 76ers could struggle. They'll need Tyrese Maxey to continue his career-best season to power through Embiid's absence.\n\nOvercoming MVP's absence:Joel Embiid set to miss more games with meniscus injury, 76ers say\n\nThe Knicks are second to the Timberwolves in most defensive categories and guard Jalen Brunson made his first All-Star team this season. Julius Randle, the team's second-leading scorer, is out for multiple weeks with a shoulder injury. New York's won a league-best nine games in a row but four of their six games before the All-Star break are against teams currently in playoff position.\n\nLeBron James and Anthony Davis missed Thursday's road win over the Celtics and there's plenty of questions about Darvin Ham's future. Los Angeles is 20th in the league in offensive rating and 14th in defensive rating. As usual, they'll likely be in the market around the trade deadline for an upgrade but could struggle to put together a good package for a plus player. As long as James and Davis are on the court, the Lakers are a threat to make a run."}

Two weeks ago, he finished T-22 in the PGA Tour Champions 2024 season opener in Hawaii.\n\n\u201cI will have surgery today to repair the injury, which will cause me to miss time playing competitive golf as I recover,\u201d Langer said in a statement. \u201cThroughout my career, faith and family have been my bedrocks, providing me strength and guiding me through difficult times. I will lean on both as I work towards a return to competition.\n\n\u201cI appreciate everyone\u2019s support during this time, and I look forward to seeing the fans and my fellow competitors back on the course soon.\u201d\n\nLanger also announced last month this year\u2019s Masters would be his last.

The 2024 Masters is April 11-14.\n\nHe has 46 wins on the PGA Tour Champions, the most all-time, and 12 senior major championships.\n\nThe Achilles is the tendon that goes up the back of the ankle and connects the foot to the leg. It runs from the heel bone to the bottom of the calf muscle. It directs movement from the leg to the foot, including pointing and flexing.\n\nFull recovery from an Achilles tendon injury can take up to 12 months, meaning it\u2019s unlikely we see him play at the Masters.\n\nThe odds of injuring an Achilles tendon increase with age, according to the Mayo Clinic. Most Achilles injuries happen between the ages of 30 and 40. Men are five times more likely to experience the injury than women.\n\nLanger is the defending champion at the Chubb Classic, Feb. 16-18, at Tiburon Golf Club in Naples, Florida, as well as the U.S. Senior Open, which was his record-setting Champions victory last summer."}

Ticket prices at Allegiant Stadium are the most expensive in history, according to TickPick, with average prices around $9,619 on the secondary market. Tickets to Super Bowl 57, in comparison, averaged $5,795. Suites at Allegiant Stadium range from $1.4M all the way up to $2.5M for an Owner's Club Suite, which includes 20 suite tickets, two parking passes and a food and beverage package.\n\n\"We are not in a suite, I will tell you that,\" Lisa McCaffrey added. \"They are outrageously expensive.

Culpo revealed on her Instagram Story on Friday that she did reserve a suite for her soon-to-be mother-in-law: \"Fake News! Happy Birthday Lisa, I bought you a suite.\" (Lisa McCaffrey's birthday is next week.)\n\nMcCaffrey said her son's close friends will not be able to go to the Super Bowl due to the prices, and will instead host a watch party in Las Vegas nearby. She added that the environment will be different there, compared to the 49ers' NFC championship win over the Detroit Lions at Levi's Stadium last week: \"You're not getting your fans (at the Super Bowl) because you can't afford it, we can barley afford it and our son's playing.\"\n\nThis is not Lisa McCaffrey's first time cheering someone on in the Super Bowl. Although this will mark her son's first ever Super Bowl appearance, her husband, former NFL wide receiver Ed McCaffrey, won one Super Bowl with the 49ers (1995) and two with the Denver Broncos (1998, 1999).\n\nDuring Ed McCaffrey's Super Bowl runs, Lisa McCaffrey remembered \"being so preoccupied with (the kids),\" but noted that watching her son in the big game is going to be a different experience for her.\n\n\"There's something about your kid when they are playing,\" she said. \"I know Ed feels the same way... you want it so bad for him that it hurts.\"\n\nAs for her game-day music, Lisa McCaffrey said one artist is off limits: \"I refuse to listen to Taylor Swift songs for the next eleven days. I love her, I love the relationship, but we are boycotting T-Swift songs... My oldest son Max and I are big Swifties, but nope, she's dead to us this week.\"\n\nContributing: Jordan Mendoza"}

Kelly ownership, renovated by Isleys\n\nLocated at 1 Maros Lane in Olympia Fields, the home was built by once-famed R&B singer, turned convicted sex offender, R. Kelly, Crain's Chicago Business reported. He bought the property in 1997 after \"I Believe I Can Fly\" became a hit song, but the property was foreclosed on in 2011, according to Crain's.\n\nHe was already being investigated for several allegations of sexual abuse against minors at that time. According to CNN, the home was also the site of Kelly's studio called the \"Chocolate Factory\" from 2004 until 2010, and witnesses who testified against Kelly in the sex trafficking case said those who lived, worked or visited there were under Kelly's tight control.\n\nWolking said the house had been uninhabited for a couple of years and crumbled into a state of disrepair before the Isleys bought it in 2013. The new owners put in a kitchen, which had been missing completely, and redid the basement, which was damaged due to flooding. They also resurfaced the sport courts (basketball, pickleball, tennis), and refreshed the landscaping, he said.\n\nHigh ceilings and acoustics fit for a musician\n\nThe home includes a gated entry, a six-car garage, an elevator, a theater and a jungle-themed indoor pool room.\n\nWolking said neighbors from the village have called to congratulate him on the listing and wish him well. Further, the abutting Olympia Fields Country Club has hosted several PGA Tour stops.\n\nWolking knows it will take a very \"specific buyer\" who wants that much space and privacy while still being roughly 45 minutes outside of Downtown Chicago.\n\nHe wouldn't be surprised if another musician takes over, as he said the acoustics in the great room are gorgeous thanks to the high ceilings.\n\n\"The way it fills that house with music is absolutely stunning,\" Wolking said."}

But Weathers also knew how to have a laugh, poking fun at his movie stardom and macho persona in things like \"Happy Gilmore\" and TV's \"Arrested Development.\"\n\nIf you want to get a sense of why he was beloved for action-loving kids of the '70s and '80s, check out Weathers' five essential screen roles:\n\nCarl Weathers:Action star of 'Rocky' movies, 'Predator' and 'The Mandalorian' dies at 76\n\nApollo Creed, the 'Rocky' franchise\n\nWeathers' most iconic character was Apollo Creed, the brash and overconfident heavyweight champ that initially underestimates Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) when the \"Italian Stallion\" goes after his title in 1976's \"Rocky,\" an Oscar best picture winner. That final bout ended in a split decision, but Weathers was able to give Apollo a winning character arc in the ensuing movies: Creed becomes obsessed with getting Rocky back in the ring (and losing the title) in \"Rocky II\" (1979), then transitions to becoming friend, coach and mentor when Rocky faces Mr. T's fearsome Clubber Lang in \"Rocky III\" (1982), and then ultimately has his final fight vs. Dolph Lundgren's Soviet baddie Ivan Drago in \"Rocky IV\" (1985).\n\nNow, watching the recent \"Creed\" films (with Michael B. Jordan as Apollo's son Adonis) will become their own tribute to Weathers' life and the indelible mark he left on these movies and pop culture.\n\n'Rocky' franchise:Every movie, definitively ranked (including 'Creed III')\n\nAl Dillon, 'Predator' (1987)\n\nIf your only working knowledge of \"Predator\" is the popular social-media GIF of that handshake flex-off bit with Weathers and Schwarzenegger's rippling arms, then it's time for some homework. The sci-fi testosterone fest, with Weathers as a CIA operative and an old Vietnam buddy of Schwarzenegger's Dutch, takes those two as well as Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura, Bill Duke and others into the jungle where a rescue mission turns into a battle for survival against a cosmic menace with crazy-cool weaponry not of this world. It's a must-see for any and all action-movie lovers, and it makes for a great teamup of '80s icons.\n\n'Predator':5 reasons why the '80s Arnold Schwarzenegger original still rules\n\nJericho Jackson, 'Action Jackson' (1988)\n\nWeathers' finally got his own star vehicle with this criminally underseen and underrated action thriller, in which he stars as a Detroit cop who doesn't play by the rules \u2014 like getting in trouble for almost ripping the arm off of a dude. \"So? He had a spare,\" Weathers's Action Jackson quips.\n\nHe uses all his charm and zippy one-liners in a watchably campy, over-the-top narrative that finds our hero framed by a automobile magnate (a very evil Craig T. Nelson) for the murder of his wife (Sharon Stone) and getting an assist from a heroin-addicted singer (Vanity). Some might say it's \"of its time\" \u2014 we call it timeless.\n\nDerick 'Chubbs' Peterson, 'Happy Gilmore' (1996)\n\nWeathers showcased a sense of humor in other films, but he really broke out as a real comedic actor opposite Adam Sandler in his classic sports farce. Sandlers' hockey goon title character hits the links to pay off his grandma's debts, and he enlists the help of Chubbs, a golf star-turned-coach who now rocks a wooden hand thanks to a hungry alligator. Weathers gets to riff on his own football background, shares great chemistry and banter with Sandler and even has one heck of a fun death scene (plus sings a little Carpenters from the afterlife).\n\nGreef Karga, 'The Mandalorian' (2019-present)\n\nWhile it would have been great to see see Weathers in a \"Star Wars\" movie, he did get a supporting role in three seasons of a show that's honestly better than many of those galactic films \u2014 and got to hang out with Baby Yoda, to boot. Weathers' Greef started as leader of a bounty hunters' guild and the main guy who gives the Mando (Pedro Pascal) his assignments. When little Grogu comes into the Mando's life and changes him, Greef is also affected, becoming a staunch ally to the journeying pair and embracing the role of High Magistrate on the planet Navarro.\n\nEven in his older years, though, Weathers was as at home in a \"Star Wars\" battle as he was in the ring with Rocky or tussling with a Predator \u2014 a testament to an all-time action hero."}

They \"funneled Sun Ra's sci-fi jazz through twin howitzers. Together they staked out a vision for hard rock that felt ecstatic, giddy, boundless,\" the outlet's David Fricke wrote.\n\nThe band, initially active from the late 1960s to early 1970s, were politically active and used music to deliver a revolutionary message. They were managed for a time by White Panther co-founder John Sinclair and joined him at the 1968 Democratic Convention.\n\nThe MC5 did not achieve commercial success and broke up in 1972 but their influence lives on through generations of musicians who were inspired by the group's attitude and sound. Led Zeppelin, The Clash and Rage Against the Machine are among bands influenced by the MC5.\n\n\"Their legacy as radical rockers and punk progenitors lives on,\" Rolling Stone declared in naming the MC5 \u2013 the name stood for \"Motor City Five\" \u2013 among rock & roll's rebels.\n\nSmith, who had a long history of legal battles and substance abuse, would tell his story \u2013 including a two-year stint in prison on a cocaine-dealing charge \u2013 in the 2018 memoir \u201cThe Hard Stuff: Dope, Crime, the MC5, and My Life of Impossibilities.\u201d\n\nAlso at that time, Kramer and drummer Dennis Thompson, the only surviving member of the band, reunited for a MC50 anniversary tour and they were joined by younger musicians influenced by the MC5 including guitarist Kim Thayil (Soundgarden), drummer Brendan Canty (Fugazi), bassist Doug Pinnick (King's X) and towering, 6-foot-7 singer Marcus Durant (Zen Guerrilla).\n\nBeyond celebrating the 50th anniversary of \"Kick Out the Jams,\" Kramer felt the need to bring the music to life again.\n\n\u201cThe message of the MC5 has always been the sense of possibilities: a new music, a new politics, a new lifestyle,\u201d Kramer said in a statement. \u201cToday, there is a corrupt regime in power, an endless war thousands of miles away, and uncontrollable violence wracking our country. It\u2019s becoming less and less clear if we\u2019re talking about 1968 or 2018. I\u2019m now compelled to share this music I created with my brothers 50 years ago. My goal is that the audience leaves these concerts fueled by the positive and unifying power of rock music.\u201d\n\nKramer had planned to release a new MC5 album in early 2024, he told Mojo in December 2023. Among those involved Tom Morello, Don Was, Vernon Reid and Slash.\n\nThe music wasn't going to be the same as that seminal and influential rock album, considered among the greatest ever. \" It\u2019s not the same. We are not living in 1968. We\u2019re in the era that we\u2019re in, and one has to address that. In all art, you have to answer the question: so what? Why should I care?

I tried to talk with them about my experiences (using \u201cI\u201d statements), but they bristled and said I was being negative, so I just decided to cut ties. Other LGBTQ adults also visit this group, then leave; I just got more involved than most. Now, in the exit paperwork, they keep writing about how they miss me and hope I will visit often.

Is there something we could do to help you make sure you proofread and finish these tasks? Perhaps there is a more efficient platform we could ask leadership to provide.\u201d\n\nMiss Manners suggests this collaborative approach, as it is kind and clear.

Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight U.S. Central Command said that American forces, using B-1 bombers flown from the United States and other aircraft, hit more than 85 targets affiliated with the Quds Force, a unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 (IRGC), and local militias that it supports. Among the locations hit at four sites in Syria and three sites in Iraq were command and control posts, intelligence centers and drone storage facilities, officials said.\n\nThe operation marked the opening of what officials say will be a multiday campaign aimed at various targets close to Iran, which the Biden administration has blamed for the spiraling bloodshed that has erupted since the start of Israel\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip, including a drone attack Sunday that killed three U.S. service members and injured dozens more at a remote outpost in Jordan.\n\n\u201cOur response began today. It will continue at times and places of our choosing,\u201d President Biden, who oversaw the repatriation of the slain soldiers\u2019 remains earlier on Friday, said in a statement. \u201cLet all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe moment marks an intensification in Washington\u2019s long-running standoff with Tehran, which Biden administration has labeled responsible for scores of recent attacks in Iraq and Syria \u2014 where U.S. troops remain as part of a mission to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State \u2014 and in Yemen, where Houthi militants have fired on ships off the Arabian peninsula.\n\nThe strikes, which began at 4 p.m. Washington time on Friday, are an attempt to inflict greater damage on Iran and its proxies than they suffered in previous retaliatory actions carried out by U.S. forces in recent months, which thus far have failed to end the violence.\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group that includes several militias affiliated with Iran, claimed responsibility for the attack on Tower 22, the American base close to Jordan\u2019s shared border with Iraq and Syria. The slain troops, two women and a man, were part of an Army Reserve unit based in Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, Syria\u2019s state-run media reported that \u201cU.S. aggression\u201d resulted in fatalities and injuries in multiple sites in desert areas. State TV said that a strike on a power station resulted in a partial power disruption in Syria\u2019s Deir al-Zour governate.\n\nA provincial official from western Iraq said that multiple houses used by militiamen as weapons depots in al-Qaim, a city along the border with Syria, were \u201centirely destroyed\u201d by airstrikes on Friday. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive situation, reported at least two civilian deaths in al-Qaim.\n\nWhile U.S. officials stressed that they hoped to avoid a wider conflict in planning their response, the action had the effect of stoking already-heightened tensions with at least one important American partner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYahya Rasool, an Iraqi military spokesman, described the U.S. strikes on al-Qaim and other border areas as a violation of his country\u2019s sovereignty, which he said would \u201cundermine the efforts of the Iraqi government, and pose a threat that could lead Iraq and the region to dire consequences.\n\n\u201cThese strikes come at a time when Iraq is striving to ensure the stability of the region,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe results will be severe for security and stability in Iraq and the region.\u201d\n\nCentral Command, in a statement posted on social media, said the attack involved more than 125 precision munitions fired at assets belonging to \u201cmilitia groups and their IRGC sponsors who facilitated attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces.\u201d It was not immediately clear which of the multiple militias that Iran has ties with in Iraq and Syria were affected by the strikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey come just hours after Biden attended a ceremony marking the return of the three service members\u2019 remains on Friday at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Officials said the timing of the strikes was unrelated.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIran\u2019s elite Quds Force, which has armed and advised militant groups across the region, was blamed for scores of deaths among U.S. troops during the Iraq War. In early 2020, the U.S. military conducted a strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the then-leader of the Quds Force, and an Iraqi militia leader in Baghdad.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that Friday\u2019s action was \u201cthe start of our response.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president directed additional actions to hold the IRGC and affiliated militias accountable for their attacks on U.S. and Coalition Forces,\u201d he said in a separate statement.\n\nLt. Gen. Douglas A. Sims II, director of the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Staff, suggested that militant casualties were likely. He said that secondary explosions observed by local residents were munitions ignited by the initial strikes. \u201cWe hit exactly what we meant to hit,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Kirby, a White House spokesman, told reporters Friday evening that targets had been carefully chosen to avoid civilian casualties. The U.S. military incurred a large number of civilian casualties during a protracted air war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria starting in 2014.\n\nThe confrontation with Iran\u2019s proxies comes as Biden seeks to balance calls from Republicans for a more forceful response to violence on American forces with his goal of preventing conflagration across the Middle East, at a time when the conflict between close U.S. ally Israel and Hamas has plunged the region into turmoil.\n\nThe operation, which officials said aimed to erode Iranian and militia ability to launch future attacks on American personnel, capped mounting anticipation this week following Biden\u2019s promise to \u201chold all those responsible to account.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey have a lot of capability,\u201d Austin said Thursday of Iran and its allies. \u201cI have a lot more.\u201d\n\nIt remained unclear after the strikes whether Biden will attain his goal of heading off future attacks without plunging the Middle East into even greater chaos, which could threaten Israel and undermine U.S. interests across the region. The administration has been clear about not wanting to open a direct conflict with Iran, a significant military power that has shown itself willing, though its proxies, to target a wide array of American sites over the decades.\n\nAsked why the United States chose not to strike within Iran given its statements about Tehran\u2019s responsibility, Kirby said: \u201cThe goal is to get these attacks to stop. We\u2019re not looking for a war with Iran.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile in Baghdad, the government has called for a reduction or end to the U.S. military presence in Iraq. Some 2,500 U.S. troops remain in Iraq, and another 900 in neighboring Syria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, cast the strikes as \u201ca strong, proportional response.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, the 85 targets struck tonight mark a greater number than the prior administration,\u201d Reed said, referring to the Trump administration. \u201cIran\u2019s proxy forces in Syria and Iraq have been dealt a significant blow, and Iranian-linked militias around the Middle East should understand that they, too, will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers continued their criticism of the Biden administration over its response, and said while they welcome the retaliatory strikes, they either came too late or did not go far enough.\n\n\u201cTo stop attacks on Americans, Iran must know its support for terrorist proxies comes with a heavy price,\u201d said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) \u201cThese strikes, announced well in advance, likely did not accomplish nearly enough to stop Iran\u2019s axis. Whatever next steps President Biden takes must be significantly stronger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) said the White House was \u201cfoolishly telegraphing U.S. intentions to our adversaries\u201d for nearly a week.\n\nDemocrats shot back at their colleagues, saying their rhetoric and calls to strike inside Iran risks an unacceptable escalation.\n\n\u201cI think the president threaded the needle in terms of showing the commitment of the United States to retaliating against those who might dare to injure American troops abroad,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) told CNN."}

It comes as Trump electors are facing numerous investigations and lawsuits, with prosecutors charging electors in three states and the Arizona attorney general investigating alleged attempts by Republicans there to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nThe resolution, which some Republicans saw as intentionally vague in its wording, highlights enduring divisions in the GOP over the effort Trump and his allies waged to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Trump, now the clear front-runner for the Republican nomination in 2024, has continued to promote false claims that the prior presidential election was rigged against him. As some Republicans have urged Trump and his allies to move on, disagreements over what to do about those saddled with legal bills related to the 2020 aftermath loom over the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBowyer had initially put forward a resolution that would have indemnified members of the committee who were Trump electors, but faced pushback. He described his resolution as having two goals: \u201cto identify the awareness and involvement of the RNC\u201d and \u201censure that the RNC is vocally and morally supporting those who have been targeted by radicals with an ultimate hope that they can be financially sustained.\u201d\n\nDavid Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonprofit that works with election officials in both parties, said: \u201cThere are no such things, in the Constitution or federal law, as \u2018alternate electors.\u2019 In every single state in 2020, there was a legitimate slate of electors that reflected the certified vote of the citizens of those states, under the laws of those states.\u201d\n\nBecker added: \u201cIn several states, false electors who allegedly swore false statements are being prosecuted and/or investigated, in accordance with the laws of those states.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of those who participated in the alternate elector strategy have faced costly legal bills, investigations and prosecutions in the three years since Trump\u2019s loss. Bowyer\u2019s resolution sought to absolve them of wrongdoing by members of their own party but has no practical effect on state or federal investigations.\n\nRepublicans in seven states that Biden won \u2014 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 met to cast electoral votes for Trump in December 2020 even though Trump had lost those states. Some of them later said they met at the behest of Trump\u2019s campaign. In five of the states, the Republicans signed paperwork claiming to be their states\u2019 rightful electors. (In Pennsylvania and New Mexico, the Republicans said their electoral votes should be counted only if a court found they were legitimate electors.)\n\nThe Republicans from the seven states sent their official-looking documents to the U.S. Senate, the National Archives and other offices, and Trump\u2019s supporters used the filings to try to reverse the election results.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nState and local prosecutors have charged some of the Republican electors in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada with crimes such as forgery.

ArrowRight McKnight \u2014 the first woman to serve as the head of Maryland\u2019s largest school system \u2014 said that she reached \u201ca mutually agreed separation\u201d with the county school board, effective Friday. She is departing about two years into a four-year contract with the district that was set to end in 2026.\n\n\u201cI have felt over the past few months, there has been a distraction,\u201d McKnight said. \u201cWhen the focus is no longer on whom I have agreed to serve, I must control my fate.\u201d\n\nThe Montgomery school board met in closed session Friday afternoon to receive legal advice and get information on the status of an unnamed employee. Later, the board said it wished McKnight well in the next chapter and it would \u201cwork together with staff to ensure a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian Hull, the district\u2019s chief operating officer, will serve as acting superintendent. The school board plans to name an interim superintendent on Tuesday and launch a national search for a new leader \u201cin the coming days.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must rebuild trust, begin to heal, and ensure that our school system is equipped to serve the students, staff and families who make up our great school community,\u201d the school board said in a statement.\n\nMcKnight\u2019s departure comes weeks after she said that school board officers indicated \u201ctheir desire for me to step away.\u201d At the time, the school board declined to address whether McKnight\u2019s characterization of the meeting was accurate, saying it was a personnel matter.\n\nThe fray came as the school system was the subject of county inspector general investigative inquiries related to its handling of sexual harassment and workplace bullying complaints filed about former middle school principal Joel Beidleman. The Washington Post revealed in August that the school system had received at least 18 written or verbal complaints about Beidleman dating back to 2016. But last year he was promoted to become principal of Paint Branch High School in Burtonsville. A subsequent investigation by Baltimore-based law firm Jackson Lewis unearthed more complaints, bringing the total to 25.\n\nBeidleman has denied several of the allegations, and he was put on administrative leave in August amid The Post\u2019s reporting. He has since left the school system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview last week, McKnight, who was joined by her attorney, vowed to defend her reputation and said the school board hadn\u2019t conducted a fair process of evaluating her work.\n\n\u201cI love my job. I love supporting the children and families and staff and Montgomery County Public Schools,\u201d she said on Jan. 23. \u201cI think it\u2019s not lost upon anyone that when you take on the superintendency at this point in time, particularly after the pandemic, you do it because you love it.\u201d\n\nMcKnight\u2019s attorney, Jason Downs, added that she was the first woman to serve as superintendent and she was being treated differently than her male predecessors who have \u201cbeen allowed to finish their terms despite any high-profile incidents that may have been tried in the media.\u201d Downs did not elaborate. However, in the past decade, former superintendent Joshua P. Starr abruptly ended his tenure in 2015 after questions about the direction of the district. Downs said McKnight was doing her job well and urged reporters to \u201clook at those evaluations.\u201d He did not respond to an inquiry about whether McKnight intended to release those evaluations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporters of McKnight have come to her defense in recent weeks, including showing up to school board meeting sessions with signs pledging support. On Thursday, representatives from the county chapter of the NAACP, the Black Ministers Conference of Montgomery County and others penned a letter to school board members asking them to \u201crescind your request that Dr. McKnight step aside.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the start she has been undermined by this Board and in the Beidleman case, not permitted to do her job,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIn our view, the Board of Education is responsible for the six months of chaos and uncertainty that has accompanied this case.\u201d\n\nMcKnight, who was named Montgomery superintendent in 2022 after previously serving as interim, has nearly two decades of experience with the school system. She was named Maryland Principal of the Year in 2015. Later, she briefly left the school system to join Howard County Public Schools, but returned to Montgomery County in 2019 to serve as deputy under Superintendent Jack R. Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs deputy, she led efforts to conduct an \u201canti-racist audit\u201d to vet the district\u2019s policies and curriculums. A 198-page report released in 2022 found that students of color have a less satisfactory experience than White students in the school system. The audit said participants in stakeholder group sessions also described a lack of coordination in the central office, skepticism that the school system would be honest about the results, and a \u201cculture where there is a \u2018cost\u2019 to speaking up and power dynamics that stifle honest dialogue.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWhen Smith announced his retirement as superintendent in 2021, McKnight became the interim.\n\nShe led the school system as it was trying to return from winter break, while the omicron variant of the coronavirus was surging and shuttering schools. A nearby jurisdiction, Prince George\u2019s County Public Schools, had announced it would delay an in-person reopening after the winter break. But McKnight\u2019s administration committed to offering in-person learning with an option for schools to switch to virtual instructions if cases were too high. A color-coded chart with infection rates was unveiled that showed which schools were at risk of temporarily closing to mitigate the spread, but the plan was scrapped three days later after state objections. She apologized for the confusion in a community letter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, the Montgomery County Education Association \u2014 the teacher\u2019s union \u2014 passed a vote of no confidence in the school system\u2019s leadership, including McKnight and the school board. The resolution cited the lack of \u201ca coherent plan\u201d and a failure \u201cto provide clear metrics and criteria\u201d to guide decisions about schools reopening.\n\nIn early 2022, the district was reeling after a student was shot at Magruder High School, sending the school on lockdown for hours. An amended after-action report sent to the state in 2023 noted that some students were released into the hallway after the shooting and some staff were able to get inside the school despite it being on lockdown.\n\nThe tensions came as the school board was finalizing a search for a permanent superintendent.\n\nIn February 2022, a group of Black pastors wrote in a sharply worded letter that McKnight was being \u201cstrategically and unjustly vilified\u201d during her candidacy to be superintendent. They accused several county officials of participating in a backdoor political effort to discredit McKnight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater that month, the school board unanimously approved the hiring of McKnight as superintendent. At the time, then-school board president Brenda Wolff called the appointment historic. McKnight also is the second African American to serve in the role. She started with a base salary of $320,000.\n\n\u201cIt is emotional because I don\u2019t take this responsibility lightly,\u201d McKnight said after the 2022 vote. \u201cI care for the children in the school system as I do for my own.\u201d\n\nAs superintendent, her administration privately negotiated an agreement that brought community engagement officers back into schools, angering student activists and criminal justice advocates. She also oversaw the school system as it was dealing with an uptick in antisemitic incidents and calls from parents to provide an \u201copt-out\u201d provision for books with LGBTQ+ characters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a letter to the district Friday, McKnight touted the school system\u2019s progress in increasing early literacy and mathematics test scores since the return to in-person instruction. She also noted that under her tenure, an agreement with the schools\u2019 unions led staff to receive a 7 percent salary increase at the beginning of the school year with another raise of at least 3 percent set for July.\n\nThe revelation of the Beidleman misconduct allegations sparked intense scrutiny of the district in recent months, including from the county council and the county\u2019s inspector general.\n\nCounty residents have questioned how much McKnight knew about complaints involving Beidleman during his promotional process. At a Montgomery County council oversight hearing in September, McKnight said, \u201cI was not aware there was an internal investigation against Dr. Joel Beidleman at the time of his promotion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe county inspector general launched two inquiries into the school system. The first inquiry looked into all allegations of misconduct by Beidleman, and a report released in December found he violated the system\u2019s sexual harassment and bullying policies.\n\nThe second inquiry scrutinized the school district\u2019s general handling of misconduct complaints. A January report determined that school officials had been warned multiple times since 2019 about issues pertaining to the district\u2019s processes for investigating employee reports of misconduct. But the school system didn\u2019t take \u201cany substantive action\u201d to address those concerns, according to the report.\n\nMcKnight was charged by the school board to implement a \u201ccorrective action plan.\u201d In January, her administration said the plan would, among other things, nix candidates for a promotion if they are under an active investigation and create more rigorous background check protocols.\n\nThe school system is expected to face another hearing in front of the county council\u2019s audit, and education and culture committees on Feb. 8.\n\nCounty Executive Marc Elrich (D) said during a news conference Friday that he still seeking answers from the school board about the situation. Those questions \u201chave to be answered at some point,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the school system\u2019s policies around sexual harassment would need to change."}

As recently as 2021, SAP\u2019s CEO, Christian Klein, described SAP as a \u201c100 percent flexible and trust-based workplace.\u201d But like many executives, Klein\u2019s view has changed as labor market dynamics have tilted toward employers having the upper hand. After the company reported strong earnings last month, Klein expressed frustration with remote work\u2019s effects on SAP\u2019s culture.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big believer that on a video conference platform you can understand our culture, you can get educated, and you can get enabled to do your job best,\u201d Klein said, according to reporting from Bloomberg News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe German software giant is one of several large companies \u2014 joining Google, AT&T, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America \u2014 that have swung from flexible to firm stances on in-person attendance, signaling that the days of ubiquitous remote work are over. Companies have abandoned efforts to entice workers back with free lunches, charitable donations and concerts. Employers are now taking more punitive approaches, and some workers would rather quit than comply.\n\nWithin two weeks of SAP\u2019s announcement on office attendance, which was first reported by Bloomberg, a letter opposing it had amassed more than 5,000 employee signatures. The labor group representing SAP employees in Europe has deemed the policy \u201cunreasonable\u201d given prior assurances employees were given about remote work.\n\nJoellen Perry, an SAP spokeswoman, said the company looks forward to discussing the approach to hybrid work with employees in the \u201ctransition period\u201d between now and April.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cStriking the right balance between remote and onsite work helps drive productivity, innovation and employee well-being,\u201d Perry said in a statement emailed to The Washington Post. \u201cWe\u2019re evolving our flexible work policy to align with best practices in the market and our own experience as a frontrunner in hybrid work.\u201d\n\nMore than three years in, the battle over offices is as bitter and entrenched as ever. Last month, Bank of America sent \u201cletters of education\u201d to workers who haven\u2019t been meeting the company\u2019s attendance expectations, threatening them with disciplinary action if they didn\u2019t step it up within two weeks. In 2023, remote workers were 35 percent more likely to be laid off than their peers who worked in person or hybrid schedules, according to data from Live Data Technologies, first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSome companies that had flexible policies during the pandemic, have tried tethering office attendance to performance reviews, while others have threatened to fire those who don\u2019t come in often enough. Over the summer, Google cracked down on enforcement of its return-to-office mandate. Employees who don\u2019t comply could see it reflected in their performance reviews, which could limit their ability to get promoted or receive raises. Similarly, Goldman Sachs in August reminded workers who weren\u2019t in compliance about the company\u2019s five-day in-office mandate. Employees there can also see noncompliance reflected in their reviews.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut some workers say their office mandates are unreasonable and that employers are using them as a way to shed employees.\n\n\u201cThere are CEOs that are seeing a two birds, one stone situation with RTO,\u201d said Andy Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. He noted that companies digging their heels in on office attendance should be prepared for a battle. \u201cBy now, we\u2019ve seen a lot of revolts.\u201d\n\nAt AT&T, for example, more than 60,000 managers were mandated to return to the office on a hybrid basis starting in July. But the company reduced the number of offices for managers, making it harder if not impossible for some to commute, employees said. Workers said the mandate also applied to employees who had remote allowances even before the pandemic and those who were hired permanently remote during the pandemic. They said the majority of workers weren\u2019t offered any relocation assistance as part of the mandate, a detail that Chief Technology Officer Jeremy Legg confirmed during a recent town hall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that there are people that are upset,\u201d Legg said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAs a result, several workers are waiting to be laid off or are looking for new opportunities, employees said.\n\nWorkers at dating app Grindr were put in a similar predicament after their office mandate came down last year. Employees were required to work from assigned offices despite where they live. For some workers, that meant they\u2019d have to move across the country rather than work from the office in their city. It similarly asked workers who had assumed they were permanently remote to comply. As a result, about 45 percent of Grindr\u2019s 178 employees quit, workers said.\n\nThe pandemic demonstrated that workers could effectively work from home, using technology like Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Slack to collaborate with their teammates in different locations. Several companies lauded their employees\u2019 ability to remain productive while working remotely before changing course as the pandemic subsided.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven pandemic darling Zoom, which enabled millions of people to work remotely during shutdowns across the globe, called people back to the office. Last August, it asked workers within a 50-mile radius of an office to go in two days a week, suggesting that they needed to experience hybrid work to build better products for it.\n\nFor many workers, the mandates just don\u2019t make sense, and some research supports their views. A recent study showed that mandates don\u2019t help companies make more money, for example.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing significant losses in performance or engagement [with remote work] so a required on-site presence signals distrust and discounts what employees have been doing for the last few years,\u201d said Annika Jessen, director of research in Gartner\u2019s human resources practice. \u201cIt\u2019s not shocking that workers feel betrayed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOffice occupancy across the country\u2019s biggest business centers has hovered around 50 percent of pre-pandemic levels for the past year, despite a host of mandates from employers to spend more time in person. But early signs in 2024 suggest that mandates might be having some effect: The national average office occupancy rate hit a post-pandemic high of 51.8 percent last week, according to data from Kastle Systems.\n\nThe downsides of remote work have been more acute for younger workers, many of whom have struggled to build networks and mentor relationships in the Zoom era. In 2023, Pew Research Center data found that younger workers are facing higher levels of burnout and disengagement. Many bosses have said their younger workers are the most eager to comply with return-to-office mandates.\n\nKayla Flick, 25, an engineer for General Mills in Murfreesboro, Tenn., expected working life to be predictable. Instead, she\u2019s been surprised by the churn she\u2019s seen as colleagues and mentors come and go through the manufacturing plant. Many of her co-workers have left for more flexible jobs, Flick says, but she can\u2019t personally imagine not working in person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the isolation and disruption of the pandemic during college, she\u2019s savored the chance to bond with co-workers in person, especially others just starting their careers. She used to commute 40 minutes from Nashville, but she recently moved to Murfreesboro to be closer to the plant and her friends. She loves meeting up with colleagues for happy hours, volleyball games and picnics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty good at saying, \u2018If everyone can get out early today meet at the park,\u2019 and someone brings a cooler with beer,\u2019\u201d Flick said. \u201cThat kind of stuff is what I really enjoy.\u201d\n\nGartner\u2019s Jessen said companies that aren\u2019t thoughtful about strict mandates should be prepared to lose top talent, millennial and female workers. Instead, employers should do a cost-benefit analysis from employees\u2019 perspective, she said, adding that employees want to feel capable, autonomous and connected."}

She had taken a leave from Hollywood to study at the Actors Studio workshop in New York, and \u201cBus Stop,\u201d with its balance of romantic comedy and subtle dramatic currents, became a showcase of her new range and sureness as a performer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Murray, who had acted on Broadway with Helen Hayes, Mary Martin and Maureen Stapleton, was imported from New York because director Joshua Logan admired his intensity and felt he would not be intimidated by a glamorous movie star.\n\nMostly, Mr. Murray remembered trying to be gallant after Monroe, in pursuit of realism, wanted to do a bed scene in the nude, as he tried frantically to keep her from accidentally exposing herself. \u201cShe kept rolling around in bed,\u201d he told columnist Earl Wilson years later. \u201cI was holding the sheet over her bosom.\u201d\n\nDespite his leading role, Mr. Murray received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor (he lost to Anthony Quinn as artist Paul Gauguin in \u201cLust for Life\u201d). He then considered what to do with his newfound recognition.\n\nThe actor he most admired, he told the online publication Film Talk, was G\u00e9rard Philipe, a French leading man of the late 1940s and 1950s who glided with ease among romantic dramas, comedies and action fare and seemed to Mr. Murray thoroughly believable in every role. Mr. Murray aspired to the same versatility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImmediately after \u201cBus Stop,\u201d he played a frustrated New York accountant struggling with the temptation to cheat on his wife in \u201cThe Bachelor Party\u201d (1957), a boys\u2019-night-out drama with a forceful script by Paddy Chayefsky. That same year, he portrayed a Korean War veteran hiding the shame of his drug dependency from his wife (Eva Marie Saint) in \u201cA Hatful of Rain.\u201d\n\nHe told Newsday that he turned down the lead role of Brick in a 1958 screen adaptation of Tennessee Williams\u2019s melodrama \u201cCat on a Hot Tin Roof,\u201d a part that went to Paul Newman, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t want to follow the dope addict in \u2018A Hatful of Rain\u2019 with another introverted, repressed kind of a character.\u201d\n\nInstead, Mr. Murray agreed to what he called a \u201cpacifist\u201d western \u2014 \u201cFrom Hell to Texas\u201d (1958) \u2014 and then the 1920s Irish Republican Army drama \u201cShake Hands With the Devil\u201d (1959), co-starring James Cagney. After being asked to appear in two middling westerns, Mr. Murray bought out the remainder of his six-year contract at Twentieth Century-Fox and made a tentative deal with another studio, United Artists, to make his own movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis first, \u201cThe Hoodlum Priest\u201d (1961), centered on the Rev. Charles Dismas Clark, a real-life Jesuit priest who ministered to thousands of street-gang members and ex-cons in St. Louis in the postwar years. Mr. Murray starred in, produced and co-wrote the film after a chance encounter with Clark at a movie premiere in St. Louis.\n\nThe film earned critical praise and was a commercial success, but Mr. Murray disagreed with UA over what to do next. \u201cThey wanted to start with a western and a cop-and-robbers film, but those two stories were not unique,\u201d he said to Newsday. They turned down his request to focus on two socially conscious dramas, one focused on race relations.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cThey rejected my two and I rejected their two,\u201d he said, \u201cand that was that.\u201d\n\nMr. Murray went on to play a rising Utah senator and family man who is blackmailed because of a past sexual liaison with a man in \u201cAdvise & Consent,\u201d a 1962 Washington drama about a confirmation battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore filming, Mr. Murray recounted to the Los Angeles Times, producer-director Otto Preminger cautioned him that other stars had turned down the role. In an era of extreme anti-gay prejudice legally and otherwise, the gay subplot was considered risky.\n\n\u201cDo you think that playing a homosexual will hurt your career?\u201d Preminger asked.\n\n\u201cDo you think playing a Nazi hurt your career?\u201d Mr. Murray said he replied, noting Preminger\u2019s memorable performance as a Nazi POW camp commandant years earlier in the film \u201cStalag 17.\u201d\n\nMore than the \u201cAdvise & Consent\u201d role, Mr. Murray said his performances as unconventional men of the cloth \u2014 in \u201cThe Hoodlum Priest\u201d and as Norman Vincent Peale in \u201cOne Man\u2019s Way\u201d (1964) \u2014 gave his screen persona an air of moral superiority that set back his Hollywood career as a bankable leading man. It took his performance as an authoritarian human ruler in \u201cConquest of the Planet of the Apes\u201d (1972), he said, for the cloud of righteousness to disperse.\n\nAn upbringing in show business\n\nDonald Patrick Murray was born in Hollywood on July 31, 1929, and grew up in East Rockaway, on Long Island. His father, a former movie dance director, became stage manager for shows such as \u201cHellzapoppin,\u201d the Broadway romp starring the comic duo Chic Johnson and Ole Olsen. His mother had once performed in the Ziegfeld Follies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were constantly exposed to these fascinating people,\u201d he told Newsday. \u201cAnd those Olsen and Johnson people were insane, I mean, gosh, one week we\u2019d have a 600-pound man at our house, and the next week we\u2019d have a woman who played violin with boxing gloves on \u2026 and they were all our friends. My childhood was a great childhood. It was like a combination of Ringling Brothers circus and Huck Finn.\u201d\n\nHe attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan and won his first significant role, as a virginal sailor, in Williams\u2019s \u201cThe Rose Tattoo,\u201d which played on Broadway in 1951.\n\nCritics singled out Mr. Murray for his touching performance, but his career was interrupted when he was drafted during the Korean War. Declaring himself a conscientious objector \u2014 he said he renounced violence after a brutal fight at age 14 \u2014 he spent two years under investigation by the FBI before a prosecutor decided that the actor\u2019s antiwar beliefs were sincere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor nearly three years, he did social work in Europe through a group affiliated with the Church of the Brethren before resuming his stage work. He was appearing in a 1955 Broadway revival of Thornton Wilder\u2019s \u201cThe Skin of Our Teeth\u201d when Logan spotted him and cast him in \u201cBus Stop.\u201d\n\nHis marriage to actress Hope Lange ended in divorce. In 1962, he married Elizabeth Johnson, a model and actress. He had two children from his first marriage, including Christopher, and three children from his second. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.\n\nIn a busy career that included occasional stage roles, Mr. Murray starred in the Cold War thriller \u201cEscape From East Berlin\u201d (1962), played a soft-spoken sheriff opposite Steve McQueen\u2019s parolee in \u201cBaby the Rain Must Fall\u201d (1965), was a vigilante cop in \u201cDeadly Hero\u201d (1976) and was Kathleen Turner\u2019s father in the comedy \u201cPeggy Sue Got Married\u201d (1986). He also directed and co-wrote \u201cThe Cross and the Switchblade\u201d (1970), starring singer Pat Boone as a New York City preacher who works to help drug addicts and gang members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to his many TV guest parts and movies of the week, Mr. Murray starred with Otis Young in the interracial ABC western series of the late 1960s \u201cThe Outcasts\u201d and played the ill-fated car dealer Sid Fairgate from 1979 to 1981 on the CBS nighttime soap opera \u201cKnots Landing.\u201d He also had a recurring role as a pugilist turned insurance company executive in the late-2010s Showtime reboot of the mystery crime drama \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d\n\nMr. Murray said he aspired not to be a movie \u201cpersonality\u201d but rather a wide-ranging and consistent actor."}

Under ordinary circumstances, it can take months for appellate judges to produce a ruling. In the current case, this delay borders on unconscionable. It plays right into Trump\u2019s hands.\n\nUnconscionable is a strong word, but one that\u2019s warranted here. Consider: It took just 18 days after oral argument for a different panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to produce a well-reasoned, 68-page opinion largely rejecting Trump\u2019s challenge to the gag order issued against him by the trial judge. The issues of law posed by the immunity case are no more complex.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? The immunity panel included two Biden appointees \u2014 Florence Pan and Michelle Childs \u2014 and a George H.W. Bush nominee, Karen Henderson. They appeared disposed to rule against Trump, but perhaps a concurring or even dissenting opinion is slowing things down. Your honors, the clock is ticking more loudly every day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s ability to effectively freeze the criminal case against him stems from an obscure exception to the general rule that criminal defendants can\u2019t file appeals until after conviction. Assertions of immunity from prosecution are generally an exception, on the theory that the injury includes being forced to endure the criminal process itself. Trump\u2019s immunity claim is almost certain to fail, but his lawyers seized on this loophole in a bid to forestall his trial.\n\nFollow this author Ruth Marcus 's opinions Follow\n\nSo far, it\u2019s working like a charm.\n\nWithout strict court supervision and swift action to prevent Trump from running out the clock, his trial could easily collide with the party conventions and the height of the general election campaign. It is not at all far-fetched to imagine it being postponed until after the November election \u2014 Trump\u2019s ultimate goal, so he can win, take office and then order the case dropped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFailing to try Trump before the election would be a terrible disservice to voters. They are entitled to know before casting their ballots whether they are choosing a felon, especially one guilty of election interference. Polling suggests that a Trump conviction would matter even to many Republican voters.\n\nTrump\u2019s bid to manipulate the system is evident from the pace of his filings. Trump\u2019s lawyers first raised the notion of his supposed immunity from prosecution in late August. It wasn\u2019t until Oct. 5 that they finally filed the promised motion to dismiss; U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan rejected the claim on Dec. 1.\n\nWhen Trump appealed, special counsel Jack Smith, seeking to forestall the current predicament, asked the Supreme Court to leapfrog the appeals court and decide the matter itself. If the justices had figured there was no need for them to step in because the appeals court would act swiftly \u2014 well, that now looks like a bad bet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, Chutkan issued a court order indefinitely postponing the trial, which had been scheduled for March 4. Smith has estimated the trial will take two months. Meanwhile, pretrial proceedings remain stalled while appeals drag on, a process that could take weeks, if not months. If, as expected, the panel rules against Trump, he is entitled to ask the full appeals court for rehearing, and then to seek Supreme Court review.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the justices would decline to hear the case or summarily affirm the appeals court, without going through the time-consuming process of briefing, oral argument and opinion writing. But Smith himself has argued that the case is \u201cat the apex of public importance,\u201d so such cursory treatment might be unlikely. And recall: It took two months \u2014 lightning speed in Supreme Court terms \u2014 for the justices to decide that President Richard M. Nixon had to comply with a subpoena for the Watergate tapes.\n\nOnce the appeals are finished, Trump\u2019s lawyers will receive extra time to resume pretrial preparations. That means it will be difficult, if not impossible, to conclude any trial by the time of the Republican National Convention, which gets underway July 15.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf note, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure require that the defendant \u201cmust be present\u201d at \u201cevery trial stage.\u201d What happens if the trial can\u2019t start until the general election campaign is in full swing? No doubt Trump \u2014 having engineered the delay that ensured this overlap \u2014 will then insist that the electoral calendar calls for postponing the trial. This calls to mind the murderer who kills his parents and then pleads for mercy because he is an orphan. But it is also unsettling to imagine Trump unable to campaign because he is mired in trial.\n\nWhat can be done? The appeals court, delayed decision notwithstanding, has demonstrated its awareness of the need for quick action; it set an expedited schedule for briefing and oral argument. When the panel finally rules, it must take care to set limits that prevent Trump from exploiting the usual deadlines for filing appeals. As a useful analysis from Protect Democracy in Just Security demonstrates, Trump would ordinarily have 30 days to ask for review by the full appeals court, and 90 days after that to go to the high court."}

Willis (D) acknowledged that she had a personal relationship with an outside prosecutor she appointed to manage the election interference case against former president Donald Trump and his allies. But she denied claims that the relationship had tainted the proceedings.\n\nIn a 176-page court filing on Friday, Willis called the claims against her \u201cmeritless\u201d and \u201csalacious.\u201d She asked a judge to reject motions from Trump and other co-defendants that seek to disqualify her and her office from the case \u2014 and to do so without an evidentiary hearing. Willis denied claims of misconduct and said there was no evidence that the relationship between her and special prosecutor Nathan Wade had prejudiced the case.\n\nThe filing included a sworn affidavit from Wade, who said there was \u201cno personal relationship\u201d between him and Willis \u201cprior to or at the time\u201d he was appointed. Wade\u2019s affidavit said that in 2022 he and Willis \u201cdeveloped a personal relationship in addition to our professional association and friendship.\u201d The filing did not say whether that personal relationship is ongoing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWade also denied that his role had financially benefited Willis. Mike Roman, the Trump co-defendant who first leveled allegations of misconduct, accused Wade of paying for \u201clavish\u201d vacations with Willis. Wade said in his affidavit that the two had split travel expenses \u201cequally.\u201d An attached exhibit includes receipts for airline tickets for a trip to Miami in December 2022 that Willis bought for herself and Wade.\n\n\u201cNo funds paid to me in compensation for my role as Special Prosecutor have been shared with or provided to District Attorney Willis,\u201d Wade said in the affidavit. \u201cThe District Attorney received no funds or personal financial gain from my position as Special Prosecutor.\u201d\n\nWillis\u2019s response has been eagerly anticipated by the defendants, their lawyers and the public at large. Even defenders of the case have conceded that Willis damaged her own reputation and public perception of the case itself by engaging in a relationship with Wade. The fate of the Georgia case now falls to Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who has scheduled an evidentiary hearing on the allegations for Feb. 15. But even if he rules for Willis and cancels that hearing, the headlines will continue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Georgia Senate committee is also investigating the allegations, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has referred the matter to the Georgia ethics commission for potential sanctions and has also requested that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) or Attorney General Chris Carr (R) launch a criminal investigation. In other words, the controversy is likely to swirl in public for weeks to come, with embarrassing questions about Willis\u2019s personal life and finances potentially damaging the public\u2019s \u2014 and a future jury\u2019s \u2014 faith in her judgment and in the merits of the case.\n\nThe response contains numerous citations of case law that Willis claims render all three motions to disqualify her meritless. A personal relationship among prosecutors does not create a conflict of interest, she wrote.\n\nWillis\u2019s response came more than three weeks after Roman, a former high-ranking campaign aide during the 2020 election, alleged in a court filing that Willis was engaged in a \u201cpersonal, romantic relationship\u201d with Wade, whose firm has been paid more than $653,000 by the district attorney\u2019s office since he was tapped as an outside prosecutor on the case in November 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoman claimed Willis may have broken the law by hiring Wade and then allowing him to pay for \u201cvacations across the world\u201d with her that were unrelated to their work on the case. Wade and Willis, Roman\u2019s filing claimed, were \u201cprofiting significantly from this prosecution at the expense of the taxpayers.\u201d Roman\u2019s filing, which offered no proof to back up the sensational claims, called for the prosecutors to be disqualified and for the charges against him to be dismissed.\n\nRoman\u2019s motion was later joined by Trump and another co-defendant in the case, Atlanta-area attorney Bob Cheeley, who are also seeking to have Willis disqualified and charges dismissed.\n\nAshleigh Merchant, Roman\u2019s attorney, filed a quick response late Friday, urging McAfee to move forward with the evidentiary hearing and accusing Willis and Wade of trying to \u201cescape accountability\u201d in a case where \u201cfreedom and lives are at stake.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf Mr. Roman had not uncovered the now-admitted personal relationship between Willis and Wade, no one may have ever known about it. That raises the obvious and important question: If they had nothing to hide in the first place because they did nothing wrong, then why did they intentionally not tell anyone about it until they got caught with their hand in the cookie jar?\u201d Merchant wrote. \u201cThis Court cannot just take their word for it.\u201d\n\nMerchant has issued subpoenas for witnesses and documents for the Feb. 15 hearing to back up her client\u2019s claims of misconduct. Merchant subpoenaed several banks \u2014 including American Express and Capital One \u2014 seeking financial records tied to Wade and his law firm. She has also subpoenaed Willis, Wade and nearly a dozen staffers and associates of the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nThe district attorney\u2019s office intends to file motions to quash those subpoenas, according to Willis\u2019s filing. Willis leveled withering criticism at Merchant for her attempts to probe her and Wade\u2019s personal lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy issuing so many subpoenas, Willis wrote, Merchant \u201cseemingly anticipates a hearing that would last days, garner more breathless media coverage, and intrude even further into the personal lives of the prosecution team in an effort to embarrass and harass the District Attorney personally. This is not an example of zealous advocacy, nor is it a good faith effort to develop a record on a disputed legal issue \u2014 it is a ticket to the circus.\u201d\n\nUntil now, neither Willis nor Wade had directly addressed or denied the allegations. Bank records made public as part of Wade\u2019s divorce proceedings showed Wade bought plane tickets for himself and Willis on two occasions \u2014 a trip to Aruba purchased in October 2022 on American Airlines, and a second trip purchased in April 2023 to San Francisco on Delta Air Lines. It is unclear if Willis reimbursed Wade for the tickets or went on those trips.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nBut Wade, in his affidavit, implied the two traded off paying for their joint trips using their personal funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt times I have made and purchased travel for District Attorney Willis and myself from my personal funds. At other times District Attorney Willis has made and purchased travel for she and I from her personal funds,\u201d Wade said in the affidavit, adding that he and Willis are \u201cfinancially independent professionals.\u201d\n\nIn Friday\u2019s filing, Willis wrote that \u201cpersonal relationships among lawyers \u2026 do not constitute impermissible conflicts of interest.\u201d She pointed out that \u201cunder the standard urged\u201d by Roman\u2019s motion, other attorneys could be disqualified from the case \u2014 including Amanda Clark Palmer, who represents former Trump campaign attorney Ray Smith, and is \u201cpublicly known to be in a relationship\u201d with Scott Grubman, an attorney for Kenneth Chesebro, a former Trump campaign attorney who pleaded guilty in the case last fall and has agreed to testify as a state witness in the case.\n\nMerchant has told The Washington Post the claims against Willis and Wade were based on sources that she did not name as well as records she said had been disclosed as part of Wade\u2019s divorce proceedings but were under seal. While some documents from the divorce were subsequently made public, discovery materials were not, including Wade\u2019s bank statements and subpoenaed records from the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWillis noted in her Friday filing that after Wade\u2019s divorce file was unsealed, Merchant never supplemented Roman\u2019s motion or provided any additional exhibits that would corroborate his motion for dismissal or disqualification \u201cdespite implying to this Court that an unidentified silver bullet lay within the then-sealed divorce file.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Wade reached a temporary settlement in his divorce case, avoiding a scheduled hearing where he had been expected to be questioned under oath about his finances \u2014 including his income as a special prosecutor in the Trump case and his purchase of airline tickets for him and Willis.\n\nRoman\u2019s motion has proved to be both legally and politically fraught in a high-profile case that has already drawn intense public scrutiny and attacks from Trump and his supporters. The former president and his allies have seized on the details outlined in Roman\u2019s motion, with Trump repeatedly referring to Willis and Wade as \u201clovebirds\u201d and claiming \u201cthat case is totally compromised.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Willis\u2019s response became public Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Willis\u2019s admission of a relationship \u201cMEANS THAT THIS SCAM IS TOTALLY DISCREDITED & OVER.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer, Steve Sadow, also weighed in with a statement saying an evidentiary hearing is still necessary, in part because Willis\u2019s response \u201cfails to provide full transparency and necessary financial details.\u201d\n\nWillis indirectly addressed some of the allegations leveled by Roman and other critics in a fiery Jan. 14 speech before a historic Black church in Atlanta, accusing critics of playing the \u201crace card\u201d by questioning her right to appoint Wade, whom she did not name but described as a legal \u201csuperstar.\u201d\n\nSadow later accused Willis of violating Georgia\u2019s rules of professional conduct in her remarks at the church, accusing her of making racially charged accusations against the defendants that could prejudice a future jury. In a filing seeking to remove Willis and dismiss the indictment, Sadow noted the maximum penalty for such a violation is disbarment.\n\nWillis wrote in the Friday filing that her remarks \u201cneither reference this case nor these defendants,\u201d so to cite that as a basis for disqualification \u201cis transparently meritless.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch like the motion advanced by Defendant Roman, Defendant Trump\u2019s motion appears designed to generate media attention rather than accomplish some form of legitimate legal practice,\u201d Willis wrote. \u201cIt should be dismissed out of hand.\u201d\n\nWhile McAfee could find that Willis and Wade did not do anything legally wrong, Cheeley, one of the co-defendants, has pointed to an ethical misstep earlier in the Trump investigation that blocked Willis and her office from developing a criminal case against Burt Jones, a 2020 Trump elector who was later elected as Georgia\u2019s lieutenant governor.\n\nIn July 2022, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who presided over a special grand jury that investigated 2020 election interference by Trump and his allies, disqualified Willis after she sponsored a primary fundraiser for a Democrat who went on to face Jones in the general election.\n\nWhile McBurney allowed that Willis had not done anything legally wrong, the judge called it a \u201cwhat are you thinking moment,\u201d and said she had compromised public trust in the investigation.\n\n\u201cAn investigation of this significance, garnering the public attention it necessarily does and touching so many political nerves in our society, cannot be burdened by legitimate doubts about the District Attorney\u2019s motives,\u201d McBurney wrote in his order disqualifying her from the case.\n\nAttorneys for Cheeley have cited McBurney\u2019s decision as an avenue that McAfee should consider, writing that McBurney\u2019s ruling that the mere \u201cappearance\u201d of conflict disqualified her from investigating Jones and that the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d now involving Wade \u201crequires disqualification.\u201d\n\nBut in her Friday response, Willis argued that McBurney\u2019s ruling on Jones should not be \u201cbinding precedent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe elevated standard applied in that analysis was, respectfully, inconsistent with the actual legal standard Georgia appellate courts have applied for decades\u201d and \u201csheds no light\u201d on the current motions in the case, Willis wrote.\n\nWillis\u2019s response also forcefully defended Wade\u2019s qualifications to lead the Trump case and characterized Roman\u2019s efforts to discredit Wade professionally as \u201cfactually inaccurate, unsupported, and malicious.\u201d\n\nThe filing contained several examples of racist emails and handwritten letters Willis has received since she launched the investigation into Trump. It says Roman\u2019s accusation that the case has brought her personal financial gain \u201cignores that District Attorney Willis has attracted both positive and negative publicity related to this case, which include ongoing personal security threats, racial slurs, sexual invective, and attacks.\u201d\n\nOne of the notes shows a photograph of Willis next to a picture of a gallows and a noose, with the phrase \u201cI\u2019m past the point of just wanting them in prison.\u201d Another refers to Wade as \u201cthat black buck of yours\u201d and ends with the phrase \u201cSLAVERY FOREVER.\u201d\n\nWillis\u2019s response also questioned the motivations behind the attacks on her and Wade, acknowledging that if she and her office are disqualified, it will be up to a state agency to find another prosecutor willing to take on the case \u2014 a process that could delay if not derail the entire case against Trump and his allies."}

In the appeal, Trump is arguing that the government does not have authority under the Constitution to bring charges against him for actions he took while president after the 2020 election through the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, when he attempted to prevent Congress from confirming Joe Biden\u2019s election victory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe delay in the D.C. case makes it increasingly likely that the first of Trump\u2019s four criminal trials could be held this spring in Manhattan on New York state charges of business fraud in connection with hush money payments during the 2016 election. That trial has nominally been set for March 25, but the court in that case has signaled deference to Trump\u2019s federal election subversion case.

Chutkan has also made clear that if and when she gets the green light to set a new date, she would not set shorter deadlines that would require Trump\u2019s attorneys to make up for lost time, suggesting the trial would be pushed back weeks if not months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spokesman for Smith said the office had no comment, and spokespeople for Trump and for the court did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nTrump\u2019s other criminal cases are in South Florida, where he faces federal charges of mishandling and retaining classified documents after leaving the White House and obstructing government efforts to recover them from his Mar-a-Lago home, and in Georgia, for a state election obstruction case.\n\nIn his federal election interference case in D.C., Trump is arguing that he cannot be tried for trying to overturn the 2020 election results because he was acquitted by the Senate of inciting the 2021 Capitol attack, arguing under the constitutional principle of double jeopardy that only impeached and removed presidents can be criminally prosecuted.\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments Jan. 9 after fast-tracking the case, but it has not yet issued an opinion. The dispute could go on to the full circuit court or the Supreme Court, with the prospect of a trial hanging in the balance. While ordinary criminal-case appeals must wait until after conviction, claims like Trump\u2019s that assert a constitutional right not to face trial at all must be decided before trial, posing a key hurdle as well as a potential history-setting legal precedent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChutkan rejected Trump\u2019s arguments in a Dec. 1 opinion, saying Trump\u2019s term as president \u201cdid not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens.\u201d She said his double-jeopardy impeachment claim defied the Constitution\u2019s \u201cplain meaning, original understanding, and common sense.\u201d\n\nChutkan acknowledged before Friday that Trump\u2019s trial would not go forward in March. On Jan. 24 she scheduled a new trial for April 2, when Trump\u2019s projected six-to-eight-week trial would have been ongoing. On Wednesday, Chutkan set a March 18 hearing for another defendant, saying, \u201cI suspect in March I will not be in trial.\u201d\n\nChutkan\u2019s next trial is set for July 2.

But it is increasingly likely that case will be his first to go to trial, perhaps as soon as next month.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Tanya S. Chutkan on Friday filed a brief order canceling the planned March 4 date for Trump\u2019s trial on obstruction conspiracy charges related to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. That leaves the New York case, slated to begin in late March, as the one most likely to make history as the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team had already been preparing for the New York case to be first, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal strategy. Some Trump advisers view the New York case as the weakest of the four and believe that indictment last March helped Trump rebuild support among Republicans, these people said. Many advisers think the GOP reaction to Trump\u2019s criminal charges would have been different if another case \u2014 related to possession of classified documents \u2014 had come first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo instead of hearing evidence about efforts to block a U.S. election or improperly keep highly classified U.S. secrets, the first jury to weigh alleged crimes by Trump as he again runs for president could be focused on sordid allegations of a long-ago sexual encounter with an adult-film star. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him.\n\n\u201cThis was the first indictment of Trump but quickly became seen as the runt of the litter, compared to bigger, more consequential cases,\u201d said Ronald Kuby, a veteran criminal defense lawyer in New York. He said the New York trial may be a \u201cgarden-variety fraud case,\u201d but its simplicity is also its saving grace.\n\n\u201cUnlike the D.C. case, this does not involve any question of presidential immunity. Unlike the Florida documents case, this does not involve the lengthy proceedings that are needed in cases where classified information is at issue, and unlike the Georgia case, it is not a sprawling indictment of 18 people \u2014 there\u2019s one defendant,\u201d Kuby said. \u201cAnd the evidence that has been made publicly available is compelling.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, said the prospect of the New York case being Trump\u2019s first criminal trial \u201cis somewhat of a worst-case scenario for prosecutors,\u201d because it is a novel use of the law in a high-profile, politically sensitive matter.\n\n\u201cBy leading off the string of indictments with the case that is the most problematic from a legal, rather than evidentiary standpoint, this runs the risk of potentially handing the Trump defense team an early win on legal sufficiency grounds that plays into the defense claims that all of these prosecutions are politically motivated and may spill over to damage the credibility of the other criminal cases in the minds of the public,\u201d Mintz said.\n\nThe charges in the business-records case are related to Trump\u2019s alleged misclassification of reimbursement payments to Michael Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer. Cohen paid adult-film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump years earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has accused Trump of reimbursing Cohen for that hush money with payments described as legal fees, when in fact they were a campaign expense meant to keep Trump\u2019s presidential bid untarnished by tawdry allegations of a tryst.\n\nTrump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records, a felony in New York where there is an intent to defraud that includes intent to \u201ccommit another crime or to aid or conceal\u201d a crime. In announcing the charges, Bragg said the goal of Trump\u2019s scheme was to cover up violations of New York election law, which makes it a crime to conspire to illegally promote a candidate. Bragg also said the $130,000 payment exceeded the federal campaign contribution cap.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the least serious of the crimes he\u2019s been charged with, but charging a president with a crime is as serious as it gets, and the stakes are unbelievably high for everyone,\u201d said Joshua Naftalis, a former federal prosecutor in New York now at Pallas Partners. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any debate that this happened, the question is whether this is something you can prove at trial and whether this was the type of case an office should put its resources into, given the timing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaftalis said Bragg (D) is a careful, smart prosecutor. \u201cThe criticism here is that the case may seem like yesterday\u2019s mashed potatoes, but it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes a while to make the case.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe circumstances of how a local prosecutor came to charge Trump with those alleged crimes \u2014 Class E felonies under New York law that do not automatically carry jail time \u2014 are part of the reason some lawyers are skeptical.\n\nThe conduct at issue was more than seven years ago, before Trump became president. Federal prosecutors and agents investigated the same events, and ultimately got a guilty plea from Cohen for tax evasion, campaign finance violations and making false statements.\n\nBut they declined to pursue charges against Trump, in large part because of concerns prosecutors had about Cohen\u2019s credibility as a witness, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal prosecutors were also reluctant to charge Trump in part because a similar type of case against former Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. John Edwards was rejected by a jury years earlier, these people said.\n\nTrump\u2019s defense attorneys have said they will focus on the fact that Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements, hoping to undermine his testimony before the jury. But Kuby, the New York defense lawyer, said Cohen\u2019s credibility problems are not fatal to the case.\n\n\u201cThe answer to the argument that Cohen is a liar, a cheat, a thief and the worst person on earth, is the standard prosecutorial answer: \u2018We didn\u2019t pick Michael Cohen; Donald Trump picked Michael Cohen,\u2019\u201d Kuby said.\n\nComplicating matters, Bragg sought a grand jury indictment on the business fraud charges after a former deputy publicly criticized him for not charging Trump on a separate issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge overseeing the case, Juan Merchan, has scheduled a critical hearing for Feb. 15, in which a firm schedule may be set for the trial. While Bragg has publicly signaled a willingness to delay his case for other prosecutors, particularly special counsel Jack Smith, to go to trial first, that now seems unlikely given the pace of both of Smith\u2019s federal cases.\n\nIn Washington, where Trump has been charged with obstruction conspiracy related to his efforts to prevent the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 presidential contest, the judge had initially scheduled the trial to begin in early March.\n\nBut trial dates have a tendency to slip, and in Trump\u2019s D.C. case, he filed an appeal claiming he was protected from prosecution for two reasons: presidential immunity and double jeopardy \u2014 because a Senate impeachment in 2021 over the Jan. 6 riot ended in his acquittal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA federal appeals court heard arguments on those questions in early January, and has yet to issue an opinion. Whatever the three-judge panel decides may be appealed further, possibly to the Supreme Court. Already, the appeals have taken two months \u2014 time in which the trial preparation is essentially frozen.\n\nEven with that delay, the D.C. criminal trial may still move faster than the other two criminal cases Trump is facing. In the Florida case involving classified documents, a key hearing is scheduled for early March, where Judge Aileen M. Cannon is likely to indicate whether she plans to try to stick to a trial starting in late May."}

Before he entered the ring, James Brown sang \u201cLiving in America\u201d with showgirls and Creed popped up on a balcony in a Star-Spangled Banner shorts and waistcoat combo and an Uncle Sam hat, dancing and taunting Drago.\n\nA bloodied Creed collapses in the ring after taking a vicious beating, twitches and is cradled by Rocky as he dies, inevitably setting up a fight between Drago and Rocky. But while Creed is gone, his character\u2019s son, Michael B. Jordan\u2019s Adonis Creed, would lead his own boxing trilogy starting in 2015.\n\nWeathers went on to 1987\u2019s \u201cPredator,\u201d where he flexed his pecs alongside Ventura, Schwarzenegger and a host of others, and 1988\u2019s nouveau blaxploitation flick \u201cAction Jackson,\u201d where he trains his flamethrower on a bad guy and asks, \u201cHow do you like your ribs?\u201d before broiling him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe lost an icon,\u201d former \u201cPredator\u201d co-star Jesse Ventura wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cCarl Weathers was a phenomenal talent, a true professional and a dear friend.\u201d\n\nHe later added a false wooden hand to play a golf pro for the 1996 comedy classic \u201cHappy Gilmore\u201d opposite Adam Sandler and starred in Dick Wolf\u2019s short-lived spin-off series \u201cChicago Justice\u201d in 2017 and in Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d earning an Emmy Award nomination in 2021.

Smart as hell. Loyal as hell. Funny as hell.\u201d\n\nWeathers grew up admiring actors such as Woody Strode, whose combination of physique and acting prowess in \u201cSpartacus\u201d made an early impression. Others he idolized included actors Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte and athletes Jim Brown and Muhammad Ali, stars who broke the mold and the color barrier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are so many people that came before me who I admired and whose success I wanted to emulate, and just kind of hit the benchmarks they hit in terms of success, who created a pathway that I\u2019ve been able to walk and find success as a result. And hopefully I can inspire someone else to do good work as well,\u201d he told the Detroit News 2023. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just a lucky guy.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in New Orleans, Weathers started performing in plays as early as grade school. In high school, athletics took him down another path but he would reunite with his first love later in life.\n\nWeathers played college football at San Diego State University \u2014 he majored in theater \u2014 and went on to play for one season in the NFL, for the Oakland Raiders, in 1970.\n\n\u201cWhen I found football, it was a completely different outlet,\u201d says Weathers told the Detroit News. \u201cIt was more about the physicality, although one does feed the other. You needed some smarts because there were playbooks to study and film to study, to learn about the opposition on any given week.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the Raiders, he joined the Canadian Football League, playing for two years while finishing up his studies during the offseason at San Francisco State University. He graduated with a B.A. in drama in 1974.\n\nAfter appearing in several films and TV shows, including \u201cGood Times,\u201d \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man,\u201d \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d and \u201cStarsky & Hutch,\u201d as well as fighting Nazis alongside Harrison Ford in \u201cForce 10 From Navarone,\u201d Weathers landed his knockout role \u2014 Creed. He told The Hollywood Reporter that his start in the iconic franchise was not auspicious.\n\nHe was asked to read with the writer, Stallone, then unknown. Weathers read the scene but felt it didn\u2019t land and so he blurted out: \u201cI could do a lot better if you got me a real actor to work with,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo I just insulted the star of the movie without really knowing it and not intending to.\u201d He also lied that he had any boxing experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in life, Weathers developed a passion for directing, helming episodes of \u201cSilk Stalkings\u201d and and the Lorenzo Lamas vehicle \u201cRenegade.\u201d He directed a season three episode of \u201cThe Mandalorian.\u201d\n\nWeathers introduced himself to another generation when he portrayed himself as an opportunistic and extremely thrifty actor who becomes involved with the dysfunctional clan at the heart of \u201cArrested Development.\u201d\n\nThe Weathers character likes to save money by making broth from discarded food \u2014 \u201cThere\u2019s still plenty of meat on that bone\u201d and \u201cBaby, you got a stew going!\u201d \u2014 and, for the right price, agrees to become an acting coach for delusional and talent-free thespian Tobias Funke, played by David Cross.\n\nWeathers is survived by two sons.\n\n___"}

We talk about things like the potential effects of a Trump conviction on the 2024 presidential election with the assumption that this would be an event that rose to the nation\u2019s consciousness, triggering a response from both his supporters and detractors.\n\nBut this is a sort of vanity: Just because it is interesting to us certainly doesn\u2019t mean it is interesting to others. Polling released by CNN on Thursday shows that only a quarter of voters seek out news about the campaign; a third pay little to no attention at all.\n\nAs it turns out, even major developments often fly under the average American\u2019s radar. New polling conducted by YouGov shows that only a bit over half of the country on average is aware of the various legal challenges Trump faces. And among those Republicans on whose political support he depends? Consistently, only a minority say they are aware of his lawsuits and charges.\n\nYouGov presented American adults with eight legal scenarios to judge the extent of the public\u2019s awareness. Two were invented: that Trump faces charges related to emoluments or related to drug trafficking. Happily, less than a quarter of respondents said those legal threats actually existed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other six were real. The one that was familiar to the most people was the federal classified-documents case that is moving forward in Florida; 6 in 10 Americans said they were aware of that case. The one that had the least awareness was the civil suit in New York in which a judge determined that he\u2019d fraudulently inflated the value of his assets. Just under 50 percent of Americans knew about that.\n\nBut the pattern among Republicans is clear. At most, 45 percent of Republicans said they knew about legal issues: specifically, the documents case and his being found liable for assaulting the writer E. Jean Carroll. Only a quarter knew about the value-inflation suit, and only 4 in 10 knew about the criminal charges in Manhattan related to the hush money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nDemocrats were more likely to say they believed Trump faced potential criminal sanction on emoluments, which isn\u2019t true. But that was still less than 50 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn average, only 4 in 10 Republicans said they were aware of the real legal issues. On average, Democrats were more than 30 points more likely to say that they were.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nOften, Republicans said they weren\u2019t sure whether the legal threat was real. But it was consistently the case that more Republicans said that, no, those legal issues didn\u2019t exist than said they didn\u2019t know \u2014 even though the legal issues very much do. Asked about the fraudulent valuations and the indictment centered on election certification, a plurality of Republicans said that they were not aware of the issues.\n\nIt seems very safe to assume this lack of familiarity derives from disinterest in hearing negative information about Trump \u2014 and, probably more importantly, the disinterest of conservative and right-wing media outlets to report on them. In May, The Washington Post looked at the extent to which Fox News covered the documents and Daniels cases relative to other cable-news channels. It did so much less frequently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is useful context when estimating what the political effects of Trump\u2019s trials might be. YouGov also released the results of polling it conducted for Yahoo News this week, in which it explored other aspects of Trump\u2019s legal issues.\n\nFor example, the poll found that most Americans think a conviction would be a fair outcome from Trump\u2019s criminal trials. Among Republicans and those who say they voted for Trump in 2020, though, most would view such a result as unfair. Makes sense, given that most Republicans say they haven\u2019t even heard of the criminal trials.\n\nThose results look very much like the results YouGov got when it asked Americans which they viewed as a more important issue for presidential fitness: Trump\u2019s indictments or President Biden\u2019s age. About 4 in 10 respondents chose each option.\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that the responses from independents mostly matched the overall numbers, which is often the case. That means only about half of independents are aware of Trump\u2019s legal issues \u2014 potentially meaning there is a large group of Americans who might suddenly learn the details of what\u2019s been alleged if Trump is convicted of a crime."}

Valery Zaluzhny, in what would be the most consequential personnel shake-up of the war, said two people familiar with the discussion. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight White House officials did not support or object to the high-stakes decision, but acknowledged it as the president\u2019s sovereign choice, these people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive conversation.\n\nZelensky has yet to issue a formal decree announcing the ouster of Zaluzhny, and it is uncertain when that might happen. The advance notice to Washington, which has not been previously reported, reflects the influential role of the United States as Ukraine\u2019s most powerful military and political backer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe early warning also provided the White House an opportunity to urge Zelensky to reconsider the pivotal decision \u2014 even though it decided against doing so.\n\nThe departure of Zaluzhny, one of the most popular figures in Ukrainian society, could affect troop morale and shake the confidence of Western donors as Ukraine\u2019s military struggles to fend off advancing Russian forces. He and Zelensky have clashed over their divergent strategies for surmounting the battlefield setbacks as the war grinds into its third year.\n\nBut any move by the United States to challenge a decision by Zelensky, a popular figure in his own right, who has speculated privately that a new commander could rejuvenate Kyiv\u2019s fortunes, could be seen as exercising undue influence.\n\n\u201cThe perception of division at the top in Kyiv is not helpful for Ukraine, but the U.S. government should not get entangled in it,\u201d said Steven Pifer, an Eastern Europe expert at Stanford University and a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA president has the right to choose his cabinet as he sees fit. The decision should be squarely with Zelensky, as should the potential consequences,\u201d added Alina Polyakova, president of the Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nZelensky could choose to delay action on the decision indefinitely, but that appeared unlikely, said people familiar with his thinking.\n\nDistrust between Zelensky and Zaluzhny has grown over the years, in part because the president has suspected Zaluzhny of harboring political ambitions but also because of disagreements about key military matters, including the general\u2019s request to mobilize about 500,000 new soldiers.\n\nIn a tense Monday meeting, Zaluzhny argued that new recruits were needed to make gains on the battlefield in the face of Russia\u2019s superior firepower and troop strength, said people familiar with the conversation. Ukraine also needed to prepare for personnel losses, which are expected to be comparable to last year\u2019s, he said.\n\nZelensky pushed back on conscripting so many, in part because Ukraine lacks the money to pay them without significantly raising taxes for its citizens. Such aggressive conscription would also be politically unpopular.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president does not believe that this mass mobilization of men between the ages of 18 to 27 is desirable or warranted at this point,\u201d said a person close to Zelensky.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nDuring the meeting, Zelensky told Zaluzhny he was being dismissed, said a senior Ukrainian official.\n\nOn Monday, Zelensky\u2019s spokesman, Serhiy Nykyforov, denied that the president had fired Zaluzhny, but he has not responded to requests for comment since then.\n\nOn Thursday, Zaluzhny published a column on CNN\u2019s website in which he alleged that the Ukrainian government had failed to mobilize sufficient numbers of troops and called for an upgrade of the country\u2019s high-tech warfare capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe must acknowledge the significant advantage enjoyed by the enemy in mobilizing human resources and how that compares with the inability of state institutions in Ukraine to improve the manpower levels of our armed forces without the use of unpopular measures,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinding a replacement for Zaluzhny is a significant challenge.\n\nOne potential candidate is Ukraine\u2019s head of military intelligence, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov. The 38-year-old has a background in special forces, not as an army commander. His appointment would potentially signal a move toward asymmetric tactics \u2014 such as drone strikes deep into Russian territory \u2014 in a war whose front lines have been largely static in the last year.\n\nBut it is unclear if he wants the position, said a person familiar with the matter. \u201cHe loves his job and may want to keep just blowing stuff up in Russia,\u201d said the person.\n\nAnother option is Oleksandr Syrsky, the current ground forces commander. The 58-year-old was credited with leading the defense of Kyiv in the first month of the war and then orchestrating a successful counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region in the fall of 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut among rank-and-file soldiers, Syrsky is especially disliked, considered by many to be a Soviet-style commander who kept forces under fire too long in the eastern city of Bakhmut when Ukraine should have withdrawn.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Gen. Patton-type character,\u201d said the person close to Zelensky. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a human resources gene in his body.\u201d\n\nWhoever replaces Zaluzhny, it may not end the public disputes between the general and the president, \u201cand he will remain a popular figure in Ukraine,\u201d said Angela Stent, a Russia expert and former U.S. intelligence official.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear how it would affect Ukraine\u2019s military performance,\u201d she added. \u201cThat would depend on who succeeds him and how his successor is viewed by the rest of the military \u2014 and how effective his successor is on the battlefield.\u201d"}

He was 76.\n\nMatt Luber, his manager, said Weathers died Thursday. His family issued a statement saying he died \u201cpeacefully in his sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarl Weathers will always be a legend,\u201d Schwarzenegger wrote on Instagram. \u201cAn extraordinary athlete, a fantastic actor and a great person. We couldn\u2019t have made \u2018Predator\u2019 without him. And we certainly wouldn\u2019t have had such a wonderful time making it.\u201d\n\nComfortable flexing his muscles on the big screen in \u201cAction Jackson\u201d as he was joking around on the small screen in such shows as \u201cArrested Development,\u201d Weathers was perhaps most closely associated with Creed, who made his first appearance as the cocky, undisputed heavyweight world champion in 1976\u2019s \u201cRocky,\u201d starring Sylvester Stallone.\n\n\u201cIt puts you on the map and makes your career, so to speak. But that\u2019s a one-off, so you\u2019ve got to follow it up with something. Fortunately those movies kept coming, and Apollo Creed became more and more in people\u2019s consciousness and welcome in their lives, and it was just the right guy at the right time,\u201d he told The Daily Beast in 2017.\n\nMost recently, Weathers has starred in the Disney+ hit \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d appearing in all three seasons.\n\nWeathers poses at the Disney + launch event promoting \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d at the London West Hollywood hotel in West Hollywood, Calif., on Oct. 19. 2019.

The actor stood before a painting of him and Weathers boxing and said, \u201cCarl Weathers was such an integral part of my life, my success ... I give him incredible credit and kudos.\n\n\u201cWhen he walked into that room and I saw him for the first time, I saw greatness. ... I never could have accomplished what we did with \u2018Rocky\u2019 without him.\u2019\u201d\n\nStallone ended his video tribute by saying: \u201cApollo, keep punching.\u201d\n\nCreed, who appeared in the first four \u201cRocky\u201d movies, memorably died in the ring of 1984\u2019s \u201cRocky IV,\u201d going toe-to-toe with the hulking, steroid-using Soviet Ivan Drago, played by Dolph Lundgren. Before he entered the ring, James Brown sang \u201cLiving in America\u201d with showgirls and Creed popped up on a balcony in a Star-Spangled Banner shorts and waistcoat combo and an Uncle Sam hat, dancing and taunting Drago.\n\nA bloodied Creed collapses in the ring after taking a vicious beating, twitches and is cradled by Rocky as he dies, inevitably setting up a fight between Drago and Rocky. But while Creed is gone, his character\u2019s son, Michael B.

It was commissioned and approved by the General Council of Brotherhoods, which organizes the renowned and immensely popular Holy Week processions ahead of Easter in Seville.\n\nAs soon as it was unveiled last week criticism of it went viral on social media and a debate erupted over how a resurrected Christ should be depicted. Many called it a disgrace, inappropriate, too pretty, modernist and out of line with Seville\u2019s Easter tradition.\n\nSpain is predominantly Catholic and church traditions such as marriage, baptisms and religious parades are immensely popular both among believers and nonbelievers. A campaign on Change.org to have the poster of Jesus withdrawn was signed by some 14,000 people from around the country.\n\nThe artist, Garc\u00eda, defended the work and dismissed the poster\u2019s critics as old fashioned.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing revolutionary in the painting, \u201d Garc\u00eda told Atlas news agency. \u201cThere is contemporaneity, but all the elements that I have used are elements that have been used in the last seven centuries in sacred art.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see at what point, at what element, people who don\u2019t like it don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said.\n\nIn another interview published by El Mundo daily, Garcia responded to criticism from conservative groups that the depiction of Jesus was \u201ceffeminate\u201d or \u201chomoerotic.\u201d\n\n\u201cA gay Christ because he looks sweet and is handsome, come on! We are in the 21st century,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.\n\nThe artist said he used his son, Horacio, as the model for the poster.\n\n\u201cIt caught us a little more by surprise because everything was done with respect,\u201d Horacio Garcia told Atlas.\n\n\u201cA lot of controversy comes from the fact that the model is too good, the Christ too handsome, too attractive,\u201d he said. But it hasn\u2019t been all bad: Horacio Garcia said he also has received many compliments and good wishes from people.\n\nThe General Council of Brotherhoods has so far ignored calls to replace the poster before Holy Week at the end of March. In past years, some posters for different Catholic celebrations were withdrawn following criticism.\n\nSeville Mayor Jos\u00e9 Luis Sanz labeled the controversy \u201cartificial.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like the poster,\u201d he said, adding that not all Holy Week posters can be the same each year. \u201cSome posters are riskier, some more classical, some are more daring.\u201d"}

Nearly 645,000 people died in the United States from overdoses involving opioids from 1999 to 2021, including 80,411 in 2021 alone, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nProsecutors said Smithers prescribed controlled substances including fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxycodone and oxymorphone to every patient he saw at the Martinsville, Virginia office he opened in August 2015.\n\nA majority of patients traveled hundreds of miles each way to see Smithers, who did not accept insurance and collected more than $700,000 in cash and credit card payments before law enforcement raided his office in March 2017, prosecutors said.\n\nJurors convicted Smithers on 861 counts in May 2019, after being instructed that the government needed to prove he acted \"without a legitimate medical purpose or beyond the bounds of medical practice.\"\n\nThe appeals court found this instruction defective in light of a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that said the crime of prescribing controlled substances required a defendant to \"knowingly or intentionally\" act in an unauthorized manner.\n\nWriting for a three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Roger Gregory said Smithers' jury instructions were defective because jurors could have convicted him solely for acting outside the bounds of medical practice, regardless of his knowledge or intent.\n\nHe also said such an error was not harmless, even in cases with \"copious evidence of a defendant's guilt.\"\n\nThe office of U.S. Attorney Christopher Kavanaugh in the Western District of Virginia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"A doctor's guilt depends purely on his subjective beliefs,\" said Beau Brindley, a lawyer for Smithers. \"Any attempt by the government to pretend otherwise was resoundingly rejected.\"\n\nThe case is U.S. v.

In other instances, they said, they had already provided extensive information to the defense.\n\nTrump's lawyers, for example, argued that prosecutors should be forced to disclose all information related to what they have previously described as \u201ctemporary secure locations\u201d at Mar-a-Lago and other Trump properties.

These funds invest in bonds or dividend-paying stocks and manage the assets for you.\n\nThese ETFs also involve less effort than other passive income investments, such as rental real estate and product royalties. Just put your money into a fund, and you generate extra income via the next eligible distribution.\n\nInvestors often gravitate toward these types of funds as they get closer to retirement and seek more financial stability, but anyone can benefit from the portfolio ballast that income ETFs provide.\n\n\n\nWhat Is an Income ETF?\n\nAn income ETF is a publicly traded fund that holds income-producing assets such as dividend stocks and bonds. These funds aim to reward investors with high distributions, with capital appreciation as a secondary objective.\n\nAndy Wang, managing partner at Runnymede Capital Management, highlights the strengths income ETFs have over growth-oriented funds: \"Income ETFs are attractive to investors who prioritize stability and cash flow over the pursuit of market-beating returns. Those looking for reliable income streams, especially as they approach retirement and aim to cover living expenses, often find low-fee, cash-flow-producing income ETFs a strategic choice.\"\n\nInvestors can buy their own dividend stocks, bonds and other income-producing assets. It's possible to construct a portfolio that resembles a fund. However, you would then have to stay on top of each investment. Fund managers can do that for you.\n\nWhen reviewing income ETFs, investors should consider the fund's historical performance, expense ratio, yield, distribution schedule and management. Each of these factors can help investors make better decisions.\n\nFor instance, a high-yield ETF may look attractive based on its payout. However, if that fund has an inconsistent distribution schedule or poor historical returns, it may not be the right choice. Each element offers more context.\n\n\"By examining these elements collectively, investors can make more informed decisions, aligning their investment choices with their financial goals and risk tolerance,\" Wang says.\n\nInvestors can choose from a wide variety of income ETFs, but these are some of the top funds to consider:\n\n\n\nIncome ETF 30-day SEC yield Expense ratio iShares International Select Dividend ETF (ticker: IDV) 6% 0.51% Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) 3.5% 0.06% SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY) 2.6% 0.35% Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) 3.1% 0.06% WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW) 1.6% 0.28% iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) 7.3% 0.49% JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) 7% 0.35% Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) 1.8% 0.06%\n\niShares International Select Dividend ETF (IDV)\n\nThe iShares International Select Dividend ETF prioritizes high-dividend stocks in non-U.S. developed markets.

Saudi Arabia would be willing to accept a political commitment from Israel to create a Palestinian state, rather than anything more binding, in a bid to get a defence pact with Washington approved before the U.S. presidential election, three sources said.\n\nMonths of U.S.-led diplomacy to get Saudi Arabia to normalise relations with Israel and recognise the country for the first time were shelved by Riyadh in October in the face of mounting Arab anger over the war in Gaza.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia is increasingly keen to shore up its security and ward off threats from rival Iran so the kingdom can forge ahead with its ambitious plan to transform its economy and attract huge foreign investment, two regional sources said.\n\nTo create some wiggle room in talks about recognising Israel and to get the U.S. pact back on track, Saudi officials have told their U.S. counterparts that Riyadh would not insist Israel take concrete steps to create a Palestinian state and would instead accept a political commitment to a two-state solution, two senior regional sources told Reuters.\n\nWar in Israel and Gaza View All 194 Images\n\nSuch a major regional deal, widely seen as a long-shot even before the Israel-Hamas war, would still face numerous political and diplomatic obstacles, not least the uncertainty over how the Gaza conflict will unfold.\n\nA pact giving the world's biggest oil exporter U.S. military protection in exchange for normalisation with Israel would reshape the Middle East by uniting two long-time foes and binding Riyadh to Washington at a time when China is making inroads in the region.\n\nA normalisation deal would also bolster Israel's defences against arch-rival Iran and give U.S. President Joe Biden a diplomatic victory to vaunt ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election.\n\nThe Saudi officials have privately urged Washington to press Israel to end the Gaza war and commit to a \"political horizon\" for a Palestinian state, saying Riyadh would then normalise relations and help fund Gaza's reconstruction, one of the regional sources said.\n\n\"The message from the kingdom to America has been: 'Stop the war first, allow humanitarian aid and commit to a just and lasting solution to give the Palestinians a state',\" said Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Gulf Research Center think-tank in Jeddah, who is familiar with the ongoing discussions. \"Without it, Saudi Arabia can't do anything.\"\n\nThe problem, though, is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has spent much of his political career opposing Palestinian statehood, has rejected outright any U.S. and Arab aspirations for a Palestinian state once the Gaza war is over.\n\n\"Normalisation does require really - if not legally, at least politically - a commitment from the Israelis that they are open to a two-state solution,\" said one of the senior regional sources familiar with Saudi thinking.\n\n\"If Israel stopped its military offensive on Gaza - or at least declared a ceasefire - it would make it easier for Saudi Arabia to go ahead with the deal,\" the person said.\n\nThe Saudi government's communication office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPATHWAY TO STATEHOOD\n\nThe diplomatic push by Riyadh is driven by a desire to nail down a deal while the U.S. Democrats are still in the White House and control the Senate, as well as growing concern about the military reach of Iran, which has proxies in Saudi Arabia's neighbours Iraq and Yemen, besides Lebanon, Syria and Gaza.\n\nIn the past, many Democratic lawmakers have resisted such pacts and denounced Riyadh for its military intervention in Yemen, propping up oil prices, and its role in the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.\n\nBut with Biden keen on a deal, now might be the best opportunity to get an agreement through Congress, the sources familiar with Saudi thinking said.\n\nThe Saudi officials have not spelled out exactly what an acceptable \"pathway\" to a Palestinian state would involve, giving them leeway to strike a deal with Israel that does not involve any binding moves, the regional sources said.\n\nThere has also been no attempt to revive the policy long advocated by Saudi Arabia that offered Israel normal ties with the entire Arab world in return for its withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 war.\n\nThe Gulf Research Center's Sagher said, however, that Riyadh and other Arab diplomats have told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other visiting U.S. officials that without concrete and serious U.S. pressure on Israel, Palestinian statehood would not happen.\n\nA senior State Department official said Washington was continuing talks with Riyadh on the U.S.-Saudi elements of the normalisation deal - including nuclear cooperation and security guarantees - but everything rested on Israel coming into line on a pathway to Palestinian statehood and ending the war in Gaza.\n\n\"U.S. diplomatic efforts are currently focused on the immediate crisis,\" a White House National Security Council spokesperson said when asked about the status of normalisation.\n\n\"But we remain committed to the long-term goal of a more stable, prosperous, and integrated Middle East region, including through normalisation and advancement of a two-state solution.\"\n\nBlinken is due to return to the region in the coming days.\n\nA senior Israeli official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said there was \"zero chance\" Netanyahu would talk about a Palestinian state. \"But that doesn't mean the Saudis can't talk about it, or anyone else,\" the official said.\n\n\"As Israel has made clear, the Palestinians will not have sovereignty in terms of being able to have an army or to enter treaties with Iran or to threaten Israel in any way.\"\n\nNetanyahu said in a statement last month that Israel must have security control over all the territory west of the Jordan River under any arrangement in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn a possible sign of the sensitivity of the issue of statehood within the Israeli government, the official said the normalisation talks were being handled exclusively by Netanyahu and his top confident, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer.\n\nTOUGH DECISIONS\n\nA U.S. source said Washington believed Riyadh's strong desire to secure U.S. defence guarantees meant the kingdom would be willing to show some flexibility on what would constitute an Israeli commitment to a pathway to Palestinian statehood.\n\nOne step in this direction could be Netanyahu dropping his opposition to the Palestinian Authority playing a significant role in post-war Gaza, the source said.\n\nEstablishing relations with the Arab world's Sunni Muslim heavyweight would be Netanyahu's biggest diplomatic success, while for Palestinians, normalisation would put aspirations for statehood back on the map with full Arab backing.\n\n\"For the first time, I feel that there is a unified, unanimous, and sincere Arab agreement on the two-state solution to resolve the conflict,\" said Mohammed Dahlan, former security chief from the Palestinian Fatah faction, who is now based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\n\"The question is whether the United States is serious and capable of weighing in on Netanyahu to achieve that goal.\"\n\nThe Biden administration believes Netanyahu is willing to keep Israeli-Saudi normalization prospects alive but he has shown no sign of softening his resistance to Palestinian concessions, in part because of the potential for destabilising his far-right coalition, the U.S. source said.\n\nOn his trip to the Middle East last month, Blinken used the demand for a pathway to statehood \u2013 which was conveyed during meetings in Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia - to present a united regional position to Israel.\n\nHe told reporters Israel would have to make tough decisions to ensure its long-term security and integration in the region.\n\nWith a new proposal for a three-stage ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza under discussion, a pause in hostilities might give de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman the opportunity to strike a deal.\n\n\"Biden is extremely keen on the agreement. Saudi Arabia is extremely keen on the agreement,\" said one of the senior regional sources close to Saudi thinking. \"These two parties recognise that time is very tight and they need to do it soon, but the Israelis are making it difficult.\"\n\nCLOCK TICKING\n\nIf Washington met Riyadh's demands for the defence pact, assistance with Saudi's nuclear programme, and extracted an acceptable compromise formula on statehood from Netanyahu, the crown prince might grab the opportunity, the person said.\n\nHe said there was no doubt the Gaza war had complicated and delayed the process, but Riyadh's main objective was the defence agreement and everything else, be it normalisation with Israel or any other issue, was basically to enable a deal.\n\nAlthough Saudi Arabia and Iran ended their diplomatic rift in a rapprochement sponsored by China last year, Riyadh is determined to avoid a repeat of the Sept. 14, 2019 strikes on its oil facilities, the two regional sources said.\n\nRiyadh and Washington blamed Tehran for the attack. Iran has denied having any role.\n\nWashington and Riyadh agreed to start discussions about a defence pact and Israeli normalisation during Biden's visit to the kingdom in 2022 to repair strained ties over Khashoggi and the U.S. decision to end military assistance to Riyadh in its war against the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nBiden blamed the crown prince for the killing. He has denied any involvement.\n\nEnergy and security interests, however, prompted Biden and his aides to recalibrate the 80-year U.S.-Saudi strategic partnership, which was founded on a simple equation: American demand for Saudi oil and Saudi demand for American weapons.\n\nBut the clock may be ticking down on achieving a mega-deal.\n\nThe deeper the U.S. moves into the presidential election campaign, the U.S. source said, the harder it will be for the Biden administration to gain traction for any U.S.-Saudi security pact in Congress.\n\nU.S. officials hope that tying U.S. defence guarantees to normalisation could help gain congressional support.\n\nHowever, Netanyahu may prefer to wait for the outcome of the election, in which former President Donald Trump, who had warm ties with the Israeli leader and the Saudi crown prince, is favoured to be Biden's Republican opponent, some analysts say.\n\nA second Trump presidency would be widely expected to back Israeli-Saudi normalisation, though it is uncertain how it might stand on enhanced U.S.-Saudi defence ties, the analysts said.\n\n(Reporting by Samia Nakhoul in Dubai, Dan Williams in Jerusalem and Matt Spetalnick in Washington; Additional reporting by Simon Lewis in Washington and Maha El Dahan in Dubai; Writing by Samia Nakhoul; Editing by David Clarke)"}

But when all was said and done, the S&P 500 tacked on an impressive 24% last year.\n\n\n\nJanuary has continued the positive narrative. Investment research firm FactSet reported that the financial results reported by major stocks for the fourth quarter have wowed Wall Street so far, with 69% of S&P 500 companies reporting better-than-expected earnings and 68% reporting better-than-expected revenue.\n\nThe result is a sustained rally, with the broader market up about 16% in the last three months \u2013 boding very well for the outlook for the rest of the year.\n\nIf you're looking to cash in on this bull market, the following seven ETFs all offer interesting ways to play this potential uptrend as we charge ahead into 2024:\n\n\n\nETF Assets under management Expense ratio Invesco QQQ Trust (ticker: QQQ) $244 billion 0.2% VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) $14 billion 0.35% Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) $19 billion 0.09% Global X Uranium ETF (URA) $3 billion 0.69% KraneShares Global Carbon Strategy ETF (KRBN) $362 million 0.79% Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ) $1.1 billion 0.68% iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) $424 billion 0.03%\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)\n\nExpense ratio: 0.2%, or $20 annually on $10,000 invested\n\nAssets under management: $244 billion\n\nWhile the S&P 500 put up an impressive run last year, the QQQ that's benchmarked to the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index jumped more than 50% in the same period to show the power of Big Tech names like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). The index has started the year pretty much neck-and-neck with the S&P 500 through the end of January, but if you want to bank on the continued dominance of Silicon Valley again this year, QQQ is a simple and diversified ETF to lean into this sector, since it has roughly 50% of assets in tech, compared with only about 30% in the information technology sector for the S&P 500.\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nExpense ratio: 0.35%, or $35 annually on $10,000 invested\n\nAssets under management: $14 billion\n\nOne particular corner of technology that has been red-hot lately is the chipmaking sector. SMH is the largest and most liquid way to invest with this as your target, with a focused list of 25 components led by giants Nvidia Inc. (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM). This industry is notoriously cyclical, but after an ugly 2022 that saw SMH slump almost two times worse than the S&P 500 that year, it has been off to the races lately as this ETF has tacked on 60% in the last 12 months. If things turn over, we could see SMH turn south once more. But with a strong outlook for 2024, major chipmakers \u2013 and this ETF as a result \u2013 are trading near all-time highs.\n\n\n\nConsumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY)\n\nExpense ratio: 0.09%, or $9 annually on $10,000 invested\n\nAssets under management: $19 billion\n\nSpeaking of cyclical investments, another angle that some investors are considering after a better-than-expected 2023 is a return to consumer discretionary stocks. With inflationary pressures abating and employment numbers looking strong, things are looking up for consumers. As proof, the U.S. got one of the biggest growth upgrades from the International Monetary Fund in January for its 2024 global economic forecast \u2013 moving GDP growth expectations up to 2.1% in 2024 versus the 1.5% forecast just last October. With the Fed potentially easing off rate increases and growth picking up, discretionary stocks, such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Home Depot Inc. (HD), that make up XLY could be in store for a big year.\n\nGlobal X Uranium ETF (URA)\n\nExpense ratio: 0.69%, or $69 annually on $10,000 invested\n\nAssets under management: $3 billion\n\nAfter trading in the low $30s range as recently as 2019, uranium prices have gone on an absolute tear over the last few years to hit a 15-year high \u2013 with no signs of slowing down. In fact, some Wall Street forecasts are looking for uranium prices to top $100 this year and hit $115 a pound by 2025. This move has naturally benefited URA, a diversified uranium ETF that has a stake in both the physical material as well as main mining and materials stocks in the space, such as Cameco Corp. (CCJ). If you want to just play the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (OTC: SRUUF), but would rather not pay 0.72% in annual expenses for SRUUF and deal with a listing on the pink sheets instead of a major exchange (unlike URA's presence on NYSE Arca), it may be easier to trade URA instead.\n\nKraneShares Global Carbon Strategy ETF (KRBN)\n\nExpense ratio: 0.79%, or $79 annually on $10,000 invested\n\nAssets under management: $362 million\n\nUranium is an up-and-coming commodity in the age of climate change, as electricity providers look to move away from fossil fuels and into other energy sources. This carbon ETF from boutique investment manager KraneShares is another twist on that long-term trend of decarbonization. Benchmarked to an index of \"cap-and-trade\" carbon allowances, KRBN is effectively a directional bet on the price of polluting. The fund can be volatile \u2013 as evidenced by a run-up from under $20 at the end of 2020 to more than $50 in early 2022 and a crash back to current pricing around $30 a share. But if you want to bank on the growth of carbon markets \u2013 and with Morgan Stanley estimating the voluntary market for carbon offsets will grow to $250 billion by 2050, you probably should \u2013 this unique fund is worth a look.\n\nGlobal X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ)\n\nExpense ratio: 0.68%, or $68 annually on $10,000 invested\n\nAssets under management: $1.1 billion\n\nAnother megatrend that has been on many investors' minds in the last several months is artificial intelligence. From the rise of ChatGPT, the app that set the record for the fastest tally of 100 million monthly users, to the buzz around generative AI and fintech applications, everyone is eager to find a way to invest in the high-octane potential of this emerging technology. Thankfully, AIQ takes some of the guesswork out of the equation via a diversified fund that holds about 90 tech stocks, including Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. (META), cloud-based business services giant Salesforce Inc. (CRM) and a host of other companies working hard to build the future economy on the power of AI. The fund has risen about 35% in the last year thanks to this optimism, and AIQ is riding high as we charge into 2024.\n\niShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)\n\nExpense ratio: 0.03%, or $3 annually on $10,000 invested\n\nAssets under management: $424 billion"}

It was the third launch of the rocket, developed by China Rocket Co, a commercial offshoot of a state-owned launch vehicle manufacturer, since December 2022.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping has called for the expansion of strategic industries including the commercial space sector, deemed key to building constellations of satellites for communications, remote sensing and navigation.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Chinese automaker Geely Holding Group launched 11 satellites to boost its capacity to provide more accurate navigation for autonomous vehicles.\n\nCritical to the construction of commercial satellite networks is China's ability to open more launch windows, expand rocket types to accommodate different payload sizes, lower launch costs, and increase the number of launch sites such as building more spaceports and using sea launch vessels.\n\nJielong-3 can carry a 1,500 kg (3,300 pounds) payload into a 500-km sun-synchronous orbit.

Worshipers blended native Yoruba beliefs from Africa with elements of Catholicism and local Indigenous traditions creating syncretic religions so that they would go undetected by Europeans, according to researchers.\n\nOver 2% of Uruguayans identify as followers of African-inspired faiths like Umbanda. The small South American nation is home to a greater proportion of believers than in neighboring Brazil, where the religion has gained greater international recognition through annual New Year's Eve Yemanj\u00e1 festivities.\n\n'WE'VE MADE STRIDES'\n\nResearch by Uruguayan sociologist Victoria Sotelo at the University of the Republic found that the numbers practicing an African-based religion in the country have more than doubled in 12 years, to 2.1% of the population in 2020 up from 0.7% recorded in 2008.\n\nIn Argentina worshipers are also on the rise, even if from a low base. Non-profit pollster Latinobar\u00f3metro found 0.3% of the Argentine population in 2023 said they had practiced an Afro-American religion for at least 6 years, up from 0.1% in 2008.\n\nOne possible contributing factor is the increasing recognition of the Afro-descendant cultural identity that has long been silenced in Argentina and Uruguay.\n\nIn a sign of the changing perceptions of racial identity, Argentina formally included a question about people of African descent in its 2022 national census, considered a sizable victory by activists.\n\nThat same year Paraguay passed an anti-discrimination law to protect people of African descent. This year Uruguay's Children of the Diaspora Collective, a group dedicated to the recognition of African-based culture, expects the percentage of those who self-identify as Black or of African descent to far exceed the 8% figure recorded in the 2008 census, when 2023 findings are released.\n\n\"Because of our historical process, much of the (Black) population in Argentina doesn't self-identify as Afro-descendants,\" said Greta Pena, former head of Argentina's National Institute against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (INADI). There is a \"founding myth\" of a strictly European Argentina she said, which has helped to erase Black culture from the nation's consciousness.\n\nDevotees of these faiths are not exclusively of African heritage, but the greater adherence to traditional spiritual practices is helping to boost racial awareness more broadly.\n\nWhile the religions have gained traction, with their relatively liberal social mores and community focus, more work needs to be done to fight stigmatization, Andrade cautioned. Oral histories and traditions associated with the African-based religions have long been misunderstood or demonized as \"witchcraft,\" she said.\n\n\"We've made strides in terms of the laws around practicing our religion, that in theory protect against discrimination,\" she said. \"But we don't have tax exemptions like churches and simply aren't treated the same.\"\n\n(Reporting by Lucinda Elliott in Montevideo and Candelaria Grimberg in Buenos Aires; Editing by Aurora Ellis and David Gregorio)"}

But exports tumbled during the COVID-19 pandemic, when North Korea slammed its borders tightly shut.\n\nSignificant trade in North Korea-made lashes via China resumed in 2023, according to customs documents and four people in the industry.\n\nChinese customs data showed that North Korea's exports to China more than doubled in 2023, when borders reopened. China is the destination for nearly all of North Korea's declared exports.\n\nWigs and eyelashes comprised almost 60% of declared North Korean exports to China last year. In total, North Korea exported 1,680 tonnes of false eyelashes, beards and wigs to China in 2023, worth around $167 million.\n\nIn 2019, when prices were lower, it exported 1,829 tonnes at a value of just $31.1 million.\n\nThe U.S. State Department and international experts estimate that North Korea seizes up to 90% of foreign income generated by its citizens, many of whom live in poverty. Reuters was unable to determine how much of the revenue from eyelash sales flowed back to Kim's government, or how it was used.\n\n\"We have to assume that ... millions of dollars every month that North Korea is making through this eyelash trade is being used for the Kim Jong Un regime,\" said Seoul-based sanctions lawyer Shin Tong-chan. His view was corroborated by two other international trade experts, though none provided specific evidence.\n\nNorth Korea did not respond to requests for comment for this story sent to its U.N. missions in New York and Geneva, its embassy in Beijing and its consular office in the Chinese border city of Dandong.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Beijing and Pyongyang \"are friendly neighbors\" and that \"normal cooperation between the two countries that is lawful and compliant should not be exaggerated.\"\n\nU.N. AND U.S. SANCTIONS\n\nSince 2006, the United Nations Security Council has sought to stall Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme through nearly a dozen sanctions resolutions that restrict its ability to trade products such as coal, textiles and oil. It also imposed strict restrictions on North Koreans working abroad.\n\nSanctions passed by the Security Council are supposed to be enforced by U.N. member states - all of whom are legally bound to implement them - using local legislation.\n\nBut there is no direct ban on hair products, so trading false eyelashes from North Korea does not necessarily violate international law, three sanctions experts told Reuters.\n\nReuters presented its findings to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which said it was \"not aware of the circumstances\" described but that any alleged violations of U.N. sanctions are \"completely without foundation\".\n\nJapan's foreign ministry did not comment on Reuters' findings, but said Tokyo, which bans trade with Pyongyang, would continue to consider \"the most effective approach\" toward North Korea. The European Union's diplomatic service did not return requests for comment on North Korean-made eyelashes being sold in its jurisdiction.\n\nThe United States has since 2008 separately expanded its own measures against North Korea, which include sanctions on any company stocking or selling products whose sales fund the Kim regime: a restriction that also applies to non-American firms using the U.S. dollar.\n\nBut there are practical and political limitations on Washington's ability to enforce such sanctions unilaterally on entities such as foreign businesses that have minimal exposure to the U.S. financial system and don't sell primarily to American clients, according to two international sanctions lawyers.\n\nA U.S. Treasury spokesperson said it \"actively enforces the range of our broad North Korea sanctions authorities against both U.S. and foreign firms\" and would \"continue to aggressively target any revenue generation efforts\" by Pyongyang.\n\nThe Treasury also referenced its nearly $1 million settlement with e.l.f. Cosmetics in 2019 over allegations that the U.S.-based firm inadvertently sold false eyelashes containing materials from North Korea.\n\ne.l.f.'s parent company said in a 2019 filing that it discovered two suppliers had used North Korean materials during a \"routine, self-administered audit\" and that it quickly addressed the issue, which it determined was \"not material.\"\n\nThe company, which has since stopped selling false eyelashes, reiterated its commitment to making products legally and responsibly in a statement to Reuters for this story.\n\nReuters was unable to establish whether any Western companies are currently involved in the North Korean eyelash trade.\n\nCHINA'S 'EYELASH CAPITAL OF THE WORLD'\n\nThe people involved in the industry said that Pingdu, an eastern Chinese town that bills itself the 'eyelash capital of the world', is a key node in the supply chain from North Korea.\n\nMany Pingdu-based companies, such as Monsheery, package false eyelashes that are produced primarily by North Koreans, said Wang Tingting, whose family owns the firm, which exports products to the U.S., Brazil and Russia.\n\nWang said in an interview from her factory that North Korean goods had helped build Monsheery up from a small family workshop. The company was founded in 2015, corporate records show.\n\n\"The quality of the North Korean product is much better,\" said Wang, who said that she was not aware of any sanctions-related issues with using North Korean false eyelashes. She declined to name her international clients.\n\nOthers in Pingdu said they are conscious of the role sanctions play in the complicated distribution chain.\n\n\"If not for these sanctions, there would be no need for (North Koreans) to export through China,\" said Gao, who owns Yumuhui Eyelash.\n\nCui Huzhe, who represents a North Korean factory that works with a Chinese partner in a venture called the Korea-China Processing Joint Trading Company, said the North Korean firm sends semi-finished eyelashes to China, where they are sold to markets including the U.S., Europe, Japan and South Korea.\n\nHe declined to identify the two companies involved in the partnership or their clients. Subsequently, he couldn't be reached for comment on the sanctions implications.\n\nINCOME FOR A CASH-STRAPPED STATE\n\nChinese manufacturers began working with North Korean eyelash plants in the early 2000s, according to three Chinese factory managers. They said they prize the country's labour force for its low cost and the high quality of the eyelashes.\n\nAbout 80% of Pingdu's eyelash factories purchase or process false eyelash raw materials and semi-finished products from North Korea, according to a 2023 estimate published by Kali, a Chinese manufacturer of eyelash boxes, on its website.\n\nPingdu's government says the town of roughly 1.2 million accounts for 70% of global output of false eyelashes, which are often made of synthetic fibres but may also be created from mink fur or human hair.\n\nTrading company Asia Pacific International Network Technology, based in the Chinese border city of Hunchun, advertises on its website the services of three North Korean eyelash processing factories with images of workers arranging hairs and pasting them on paper.\n\nReached by phone, a company employee, who would not give her name, declined to comment.\n\nSeoul-based businessman Johny Lee imports products like chicken-feet shaped lashes used for extensions through Dandong into South Korea.\n\nThose lashes are made by North Koreans, packaged in China, and then sold locally or exported to Asian countries like Japan, said Lee, who chairs a trade group in Seoul that includes eyelash extension technicians from the West and South Korea.\n\nAsked about legal risks, Lee - who began sourcing eyelashes from China a decade ago - said he was not selling \"sophisticated technology like semiconductors.\" North Korean workers \"are trying to make a living there,\" he said.\n\nSouth Korean law states that if two or more countries are involved in the production of imported goods, the place where the products gained \"essential characteristics\" will be deemed the country of origin.\n\nReuters described how eyelashes made by North Korean workers are packaged and completed in China to Shin Min-ho, a South Korea-certified customs attorney. He said North Korea would likely be considered their country of origin because it gave the raw materials \"essential characteristics.\"\n\nSeoul's Korea Customs Services said that \"importing North Korean products disguised as Chinese can be punished,\" but that it was \"difficult to determine\" country of origin based solely on Reuters' description of the supply chain between North Korea and China and that it was not investigating the issue.\n\nGOOD QUALITY, CHEAP SALARIES\n\nDespite the quality of the eyelashes, North Korean labour is poorly paid. North Korean salaries can be a tenth of Chinese wages, four Chinese factory owners and managers said.\n\nIn addition, Wang, a manager for Pingdu-based manufacturer Co-Lash, which ceased North Korean operations during the pandemic, said the workers gave up most of their income to the state. He didn't supply proof.\n\nAnother Chinese manufacturer, PD Lush, pays workers at its factory in the North Korean border town of Rason - whose work is sold internationally - an average monthly salary of 300 yuan ($42), said Pingdu-based manager Wang.\n\nThe centrality of North Korea to the industry became clear when the country's borders closed during the pandemic.\n\nMonsheery's Wang Tingting said that after North Korea closed its borders in 2020 due to the pandemic, ships carrying over the small amount of eyelashes exported during that time were often held up. \"We have very high demand on our side,\" she said.\n\nIn the wake of the pandemic, supply was still not at full capacity and shipping delays were common, she added.\n\nSouth Korean false eyelash brand Cinderella Amisolution typically procures supplies from Chinese traders of semi-finished North Korean products, which it then sells to customers. But when North Korea sealed its border, contractors sent samples that weren't made by North Koreans.\n\n\"I thought, 'this isn't going to work',\" said chief executive Choi Jee-won. \"They were completely different.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Beijing newsroom and Sakura Murakami in Tokyo; Writing by Ju-min Park; Editing by Josh Smith and Katerina Ang)"}

Understanding which is more relevant to you depends on the medical condition for which you\u2019re seeking hospital quality information.\n\nThe Best Hospitals specialty rankings are meant for patients with life-threatening or rare conditions who need a hospital that excels in treating complex, high-risk cases. These rankings are helpful if you\u2019re looking for information about a rare condition or difficult diagnosis that isn\u2019t treated at many facilities.\n\nHospitals are ranked from 1 to 50 in each specialty, with hospitals not in the top 50 but still in the top 10% of all rated hospitals receiving a designation of \u201chigh performing.\u201d\n\nThe Best Hospitals procedure and condition ratings focus on specific and more commonly required individual procedures and conditions, such as hip replacement and heart failure, rather than on broader specialties like orthopedics and cardiology. The goal is to evaluate how well hospitals perform in each procedure or condition \u2013 not just with the most challenging cases, as with the specialty rankings, but with the full range of patients.\n\nBecause the procedures and conditions evaluated are performed at many more hospitals than the specialties, the evaluations produce ratings rather than numerical rankings. Hospitals that treat enough patients to be evaluated are rated one of three ways for each procedure or condition: high performing, average or below average.\n\nBased on your health situation, it might make more sense to go to an average hospital closer to you or within your insurance network than a high-performing hospital that is far and out-of-network.\n\nAs always, these ratings should be taken as a starting point. All care decisions should be made in conjunction with medical professionals.\n\n2023-2024 Best Hospitals Specialty Rankings, Published August 2023\n\nSay your doctor has informed you that you're about to take your place among the more than 30 million patients a year admitted to U.S. hospitals for a procedure or other care. You may want to start researching your care options.\n\nChecking the U.S. News Best Hospitals specialty rankings in whichever of the 15 specialties applies to you is in order if your care calls for special expertise or if age, physical ailments or a chronic condition could add a layer of risk.\n\nThis FAQ explains how the Best Hospitals specialty rankings are produced and addresses questions of interest to media and health care professionals. A formal methodology report, available as a downloadable PDF, provides much more detail.\n\nWhat are the specialties in which hospitals are ranked?\n\nU.S. News evaluates 15 specialty areas of care. In 12 of the specialty areas, rankings are derived from data sources, such as Medicare. These specialties include:\n\n\n\nCancer.\n\nCardiology, heart and vascular surgery.\n\nDiabetes and endocrinology.\n\nEar, nose and throat.\n\nGastroenterology and GI surgery.\n\nGeriatrics.\n\nObstetrics and gynecology.\n\nNeurology and neurosurgery.\n\nOrthopedics.\n\nPulmonology and lung surgery.\n\nRehabilitation.\n\nUrology.\n\nIn the remaining three specialties \u2013 ophthalmology, psychiatry and rheumatology \u2013 ranking is determined entirely by expert opinion, based on responses from three years of surveys of physician specialists who were asked to name the hospitals to which they would be inclined to refer their sickest patients.\n\nThe rankings name the top 50 hospitals for complex care in each of the 12 data-driven specialties and roughly a dozen in the three expert opinion-based specialties.\n\nWhy does U.S. News rank hospitals?\n\nU.S. News estimates that nearly 2 million hospital inpatients a year face the prospect of surgery or special care that poses either unusual technical challenges or significantly heightened risk of death or harm because of age, physical condition or existing conditions. The rankings are a tool that can help these patients and their families find sources of skilled inpatient care.\n\nHow are the rankings organized and updated?\n\nThe 15 Best Hospitals' national specialty rankings are updated annually. As noted, rankings in 12 of the 15 rely largely on objective data. Each specialty showcases the 50 top-scoring hospitals, based primarily on survival rates for particularly challenging patients, patient experience and other measures of performance that can be assessed using hard data. All evaluated hospitals and their results, including overall scores, are displayed online, but rankings are only displayed for the top 50.\n\nIn these 12 specialties, results from the three most recent years of an annual expert-opinion survey of specialized physicians are also factored in. Surveyed physicians are asked to name up to five hospitals they consider the best for complex cases in their specialty.\n\nExcept in rehabilitation; ear, nose and throat; and obstetrics and gynecology, hospitals not nationally ranked but that scored high enough in a specialty to put them in the top 10% of the analyzed centers are recognized as high performing. Hospitals nationally ranked in at least one data-determined specialty, or that earned at least seven ratings of high-performing and few or no low-performing ratings across the 21 Best Hospitals procedures and conditions, are further designated as Best Regional Hospitals within their state, metro area or region.\n\nIn the three Best Hospitals expert opinion-based specialties, national ranking is based on the latest three annual physician surveys referenced above. Those receiving nominations from a weighted average of at least 5% of the respondents are nationally ranked Best Hospitals. Those nominated by at least 3% but below 5% of physicians are high performing. Each physician's response is assigned a weight that ensures the weighted averages represent the overall opinion of all specialists nationally, not simply those who responded.\n\nThe 22 hospitals with the most and highest rankings and the greatest number of high-performing procedure and condition ratings are recognized in the Honor Roll.\n\nAre the highest-ranking hospitals always the best choices?\n\nNot necessarily. Hospitals are evaluated across a wide range of conditions and procedures. Within that range, hospitals can and do perform differently. In pulmonology and lung surgery, for example, a hospital might rank below another one but do better at treating patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nSo, the rankings should just be a starting point?\n\nThat's right. Patients still have to do their research and talk with their doctors. We also understand that families have to consider such factors as the stress and expense of travel and lodging in another city and their insurer's willingness to pay for care if a hospital is out of network.\n\nHow many hospitals were analyzed for the rankings?\n\nFor consideration in the 12 data-driven rankings, the rankings started with about 4,500 hospitals, which represent virtually all U.S. community inpatient facilities.\n\nAre only teaching hospitals eligible for the rankings?\n\nNo. That misconception persists, even in medical journals that make the assertion. In fact, teaching status or medical-school affiliation are only two of the four ways a hospital can be a rankings candidate.\n\nMany hospitals become part of the eligible pool through two other pathways. A hospital qualified for consideration in the 12 data-driven specialties if it satisfied any of four criteria:\n\n\n\nIt was a teaching hospital.\n\nIt was affiliated with a medical school.\n\nIt had at least 200 beds set up and staffed.\n\nIt had at least 100 beds and offered at least four out of eight advanced technologies associated with high-quality care, such as a PET/CT scanner and certain precision radiation therapies.\n\nMore than 2,000 hospitals met one of the four standards. Eligibility standards for the rehabilitation rankings were slightly different.\n\nIn the three specialties in which ranking was determined only through the last three physician surveys, any hospital with enough nominations was ranked.\n\nDoes U.S. News evaluate and rank Veterans Affairs and military hospitals?\n\nNo. Claims data for VA and military hospitals are unavailable in Medicare claims data and are largely unavailable. If these data become publicly available, we will consider evaluating them.\n\nWhat happens after determining initial eligibility?\n\nHospitals had to show that they treated a given number of patients with explicitly defined conditions or procedures. The threshold number for each specialty was based on traditional fee-for-service Medicare inpatients discharged during the three years from 2019 to 2021 (2021 is the most recent year of available data). Volume-based eligibility rules used in the ear, nose and throat, as well as obstetrics and gynecology rankings, now include relevant outpatient procedural cases.\n\nBecause the rankings focus on challenging care, only patients who had particular procedures or conditions at a defined level of severity and complexity were included.\n\nA hospital that fell short was still evaluated if it was nominated by at least 1% of the physicians in a specialty who responded to 2021, 2022 and 2023 physician surveys.\n\nA total of 2,320 hospitals met these standards and qualified for further consideration in at least one specialty.\n\nFor a schematic overview of the eligibility process for the rankings, complete with this year\u2019s hospital population data, you can refer to page 12 of the 2023-2024 U.S. News Best Hospitals Specialty Rankings methods report.\n\nHow many hospitals were ranked?\n\nAcross all 15 specialties, only 164 U.S. hospitals performed well enough to be nationally ranked in one or more specialties.\n\nWhat determined whether a hospital would be ranked?\n\nWe evaluated each hospital's performance using a variety of measures. Some data came from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Standard Analytical File database. Other information came from the American Hospital Association and professional organizations.\n\nWe put the heaviest reliance on outcomes because of the self-evident connection between a patient's outcomes, including survival and the quality of their care. Other data, such as the number of patients and the ratio of nurses and patients, are less obviously related to quality, but ample research supports the connection. The physician survey also played a role, though it accounted for only slightly more than one-fourth of each hospital's score (see below).\n\nIn the three expert opinion-based specialties, most care is delivered on an outpatient basis. The number of outpatients who die in these specialties is so low that risk-adjusted mortality rates, heavily weighted in 11 of the 12 other specialties, are not significantly tied to the quality of care. Hospitals in these specialties are therefore ranked solely on expert opinion.\n\nHow were the different factors combined?\n\nEach hospital analyzed in 11 of the 12 data-driven rankings received an overall score from 0 to 100 based on four elements:\n\n\n\nOutcomes (including survival rate and the rate at which patients were able to return home rather than needing additional institutional care).\n\nPatient experience.\n\nCare-related factors, such as the intensity of nurse staffing and the breadth of patient services.\n\nExpert opinion obtained through the physician survey. (Rehabilitation used a unique methodology, as described in the methodology report.)\n\nThe hospitals with the 50 highest scores in each specialty were ranked. Scores and data for all eligible hospitals in each specialty are also posted. The four elements and their weightings are, in brief:\n\nPatient Outcomes (45%)\n\nA hospital's success at keeping patients alive accounted for 36% of its score. U.S. News compared the number of Medicare inpatients with certain conditions who died within 30 days of admission in 2019, 2020 and 2021 with the number who would be expected to die given the severity of illness. \u201cPrevention of outpatient procedural complications\u201d outcome measures were added in this year\u2019s orthopedics and urology rankings, and similar outcome measures may be added in other specialties in future editions of Best Hospitals. The new measures are important to patients because outpatient surgeries account for a growing share of surgical procedures in orthopedics and urology, as well as for a majority of all surgeries performed in the U.S.\n\nHospitals were scored from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the highest statistical likelihood that the survival rate was better than expected and 1 indicating that survival rates were worse than expected. U.S. News's calculation of each hospital's expected deaths factored in:\n\n\n\nThe age and sex of each patient.\n\nWhat kind of care they needed.\n\nWhat other illnesses (known as comorbidities) were present.\n\nWhether they received Medicaid benefits (a measure of socioeconomic status).\n\nOther risk factors known to influence patients' outcomes.\n\nPatient Experience (5%)\n\nThis score reflects the percentage of patients who responded positively to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems, or HCAHPS, a survey about the overall quality of their hospital stay. Most hospitals are required to assess patients' satisfaction using the HCAHPS survey.\n\nOther Care-Related Indicators (35%)\n\nThese include nurse staffing, patient volume, certain clinically proven technologies and professional and specialty-specific recognition. The 2021 American Hospital Association Annual Survey was the primary source.\n\nExpert Opinion (15%)\n\nEach year, board-certified physicians in the relevant specialties are invited to list up to five hospitals, ignoring location and cost, that they consider to be the best in their area of expertise for complex or challenging cases.\n\nThe figures displayed in the rankings represent the average percentage of responding specialists in 2021, 2022 and 2023 who rated the hospitals. More than 30,000 physicians responded in 2023.\n\nIn four specialties \u2013 cardiology, heart and vascular surgery; obstetrics and gynecology; neurology and neurosurgery; and pulmonology and lung surgery \u2013 expert opinion received a reduced weight of 12% to accommodate public transparency metrics, which is determined by the extent to which a hospital is publicly transparent about specific care-related performance metrics. Expert opinion is weighted 30% in rehabilitation and 15% in most other data-driven specialties.\n\nDoes reputation determine which hospitals are ranked?\n\nNo. Many ranked hospitals have very low, even zero, reputational scores but are strong clinical performers.\n\nHow are hospitals ranked in the three specialties without objective data?\n\nIn the three expert opinion-determined specialties, ranked hospitals had to be cited by an average of at least 5% of the physicians who responded to the latest three years of U.S. News surveys of specialists. That resulted in lists of 10 hospitals in ophthalmology, seven in psychiatry and 11 in rheumatology.\n\nWhat methodology changes were made in the 2023-2024 rankings?\n\nSeveral targeted methodological revisions were implemented this year based on input from patients, clinicians, researchers and hospital leaders. These and other modifications to the methodology are described in this blog post.\n\nHow does U.S. News decide what changes to make to its methodology?\n\nEach year RTI International and U.S. News revisit the methodology based on the medical literature and input from hospitals and health care experts. U.S. News approves all methodology changes.\n\n2023-2024 Best Hospitals Honor Roll, Published August 2023\n\nWhat is the Honor Roll?\n\nThe Best Hospitals Honor Roll recognizes 22 hospitals with unusual competence taking into account the full range of adult inpatient care \u2013 both performance in the Best Hospitals specialty rankings and the Best Hospitals procedures and conditions. The honor roll is not an ordinal list.\n\nHow were points awarded?\n\nHospitals were awarded points by being nationally ranked in the 12 Best Hospitals specialty rankings, driven primarily by hard data or in the three expert opinion-based specialty rankings, or by being rated as high performing in 21 procedures and conditions.\n\nAll 50 hospitals received points in each of the 11 data-driven specialties (excluding rehabilitation). The No. 1-ranked hospital received 25 Honor Roll points, No. 2 received 24 points and so on. All hospitals ranked 21 through 50 received five points. The maximum number of points across these 11 specialties is 275, but no hospital has ever been No. 1 in all 12 specialties.\n\nIn rehabilitation and the three Best Hospitals specialty rankings based entirely on expert opinion (ranked hospitals were recommended by at least 5% of respondents to annual U.S. News physician surveys), the number of ranked hospitals varies year by year and specialty by specialty. The No. 1-ranked hospital received 10 Honor Roll points, No. 2 received nine points and so on; all hospitals ranked from 10 to the final ranked hospital received one point. If a hospital had ranked at the top in all four specialties (none was), it would have received 40 points.\n\nIn 16 of the 21 Best Hospitals procedures and conditions ratings, hospitals received 12 Honor Roll points for each \"high-performing\" rating. \u201cHigh-performing\u201d status in AVR and TAVR resulted in six points each because these procedures are alternative treatment approaches to the same underlying cardiac condition; similarly, high-performing status in ovarian cancer surgery and uterine cancer surgery resulted in six points each because tumors in these organs are treated with similar procedures.\n\nHospitals that achieved a rating of high performing in all 21 procedures and conditions would have received 228 points. In some circumstances, where a health system with multiple hospitals had consolidated a certain service at a regional center of excellence, we reassigned Honor Roll points for that service from the system's center of excellence to the system's so-called flagship hospital.\n\nThe Best Hospitals for Maternity Care ratings, published on a different annual cycle, were not included in the Honor Roll calculation.\n\nThe 22 hospitals that earned the most points out of the 543 possible comprise the Honor Roll. In 2023-2024, hospitals that earned 273 points or more were recognized.\n\n2023-2024 Best Hospitals Procedures and Conditions Ratings, Published August 2023\n\nIn a typical year, U.S. hospitals admit more than 30 million patients. More than 1 million will have a knee or hip replaced, and about 400,000 will undergo heart bypass surgery. Heart failure will account for about 900,000, while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease another 700,000 and surgery to remove all or part of the colon will account for some 250,000.\n\nAny hospital should be able to successfully treat such relatively common ailments, and many do \u2013 but some treat them better than others. The Best Hospitals procedures and conditions ratings show consumers how well their local hospitals stand up to scrutiny in those six procedures and conditions and the 14 others U.S. News rates. How U.S. News evaluated hospitals for the ratings is addressed in this FAQ. A comprehensive methodology report is available as a downloadable PDF.\n\nWhat are the Best Hospitals for procedures and conditions ratings?\n\nThe Best Hospitals procedures and conditions ratings evaluate almost every hospital in the U.S. that admits patients in any of 21 common procedures and conditions:\n\n\n\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\n\nAortic valve surgery.\n\nBack surgery (spinal fusion).\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nColon cancer surgery.\n\nCongestive heart failure.\n\nDiabetes.\n\nHeart attack.\n\nHeart bypass surgery.\n\nHip fracture.\n\nHip replacement.\n\nKidney failure.\n\nKnee replacement.\n\nLeukemia, lymphoma and myeloma.\n\nLung cancer surgery.\n\nOvarian cancer surgery.\n\nPneumonia.\n\nProstate cancer surgery.\n\nStroke.\n\nTranscatheter aortic valve replacement.\n\nUterine cancer surgery.\n\nIn 2023, U.S. News evaluated more than 4,300 hospitals to generate procedure and condition ratings. While more than 1,900 hospitals were rated high performing in at least one procedure or condition, none were rated high performing in all 21 procedures and conditions.\n\nHow were the ratings for each hospital determined?\n\nWe defined 21 groups of patients, each corresponding to one of the common procedures or conditions being rated. For each group \u2013 called cohorts \u2013 we assessed the hospital's risk-adjusted outcomes, such as 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission and length of stay. These measure how well the hospital performed the procedure at the time of care and also was able to prevent an unplanned re-visit to the hospital due to the same condition. A shorter length of stay is indicative of a lower complication rate.\n\nWe also factored in variables linked to higher quality of care, including volume, nurse staffing and whether the hospital employed a specially trained physician known as an intensive care unit specialist. In addition, patient satisfaction scores were factored into the ratings for most procedures.\n\nA hospital's stance on data transparency was also a factor. In our heart bypass surgery and aortic valve surgery ratings, we weighed whether the hospital had voluntarily released ratings it received from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. We factored in STS data for hospitals that had done so as of late 2022.\n\nWhat data sources were used?\n\nWe analyzed objective data from multiple sources, including a federal data set known as the Standard Analytical File, which contains details of every hospital admission paid for by traditional Medicare. We used SAF data on inpatients aged 65 and older treated from 2017-2021 to assess each hospital's risk-adjusted mortality rates, readmissions and other outcomes.\n\nHow well older patients are treated is generally considered a good test of a hospital's capabilities. Such patients have a greater chance of being admitted with one or more conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, that put them in a higher-risk category. We also incorporated some data from the outpatient SAF files into analysis of knee replacement procedure and stroke condition.\n\nIn addition, our analysis incorporated publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees Medicare. These included information on each hospital's efforts to prevent dangerous blood clots and the results from federally mandated patient-satisfaction surveys. Claims data from the Medicare database are the most comprehensive source data available. We are open to exploring alternatives for future editions of the ratings. Risk-adjusted data from clinical registries are one promising area.\n\nHospital reputation was not a factor in the ratings.\n\nOur methodology also drew on several measures from the 2021 American Hospital Association's annual survey and from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, a professional organization for heart and chest surgeons. None of these organizations have endorsed or been asked to endorse the U.S. News ratings.\n\nWhat do the ratings mean?\n\nAn overall rating of high performing indicates a hospital was significantly better than the national average in a given procedure or condition. Hospitals rated below average scored substantially below the national average. Hospitals rated average do not all have equal performance, but they were not distinctly different from the average in our methodology. In each procedure and condition, 10% to 20% of the evaluated hospitals in a condition or procedure typically fell into the high-performing tier, and another 10% to 20% were rated below average.\n\nRelatively few hospitals performed consistently across all measures for a given condition or procedure. Strengths and weaknesses in particular measures often varied considerably between hospitals with similar overall ratings. Such differences give patients flexibility by allowing them to decide, in consultation with their doctor, which qualities are most important to them. One hospital might have a lower readmission rate but have worse patient experience scores. Another might have a better balance of nurses to patients but a relatively low number of patients.\n\nShould I worry about going to a hospital rated average or below average or that is unrated?\n\nAbout 50% to 70% of the hospitals in each procedure or condition were rated as average. Some of these hospitals were rated below average partly because of low patient volume, not necessarily because of a high number of deaths or other adverse events. No firm conclusion can be reached about an unrated hospital; these hospitals did not treat enough patients to be evaluated thoroughly. The ratings are just a starting point for patient decision-making, which certainly should include consulting a doctor.\n\nPending such consultation, patients who have access to a high-performing or average hospital might choose that hospital over one that is below average or unrated in the type of care they need.\n\nHow did U.S. News build in risk adjustment?\n\nWe took several risk factors into account:\n\n\n\nAge at admission.\n\nSex.\n\nTransfer status. A patient transfer from the initial receiving hospital may indicate a complex procedure or condition. Patients were classified as inbound transfers if they were treated at another acute-care hospital on the day of admission, if claims data indicated they were transferred or if a previous claim indicated an outbound transfer.\n\nA patient transfer from the initial receiving hospital may indicate a complex procedure or condition. Patients were classified as inbound transfers if they were treated at another acute-care hospital on the day of admission, if claims data indicated they were transferred or if a previous claim indicated an outbound transfer. Year of hospital admission. Quality of care tends to improve over time. This means the risk of adverse outcomes is less each year. For that reason, and given that the ratings use five years of data, year of admission is included as a risk factor.\n\nQuality of care tends to improve over time. This means the risk of adverse outcomes is less each year. For that reason, and given that the ratings use five years of data, year of admission is included as a risk factor. Comorbidities. A wide range of comorbidities, such as diabetes, is associated with higher death rates. This means a patient has multiple diagnoses, with the primary diagnosis being treated, which typically means more challenging care. We used an inventory known as the Elixhauser comorbidities in risk adjustment.\n\nA wide range of comorbidities, such as diabetes, is associated with higher death rates. This means a patient has multiple diagnoses, with the primary diagnosis being treated, which typically means more challenging care. We used an inventory known as the Elixhauser comorbidities in risk adjustment. Medicare eligibility status. If a patient is eligible for Medicare because of age, disability or end-stage renal failure, this is a proxy for comorbidities.\n\nIf a patient is eligible for Medicare because of age, disability or end-stage renal failure, this is a proxy for comorbidities. Socioeconomic status. Patients with lower incomes and education are typically sicker when they arrive at the hospital and may face more challenges in obtaining or managing their care after discharge. This can affect their risk of death, readmission and complications. When hospitals differ by the socioeconomic status of their patients, this can create bias in comparing outcomes. We used \u201cdual eligibility\u201d \u2013 patients eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid \u2013 as a socioeconomic factor.\n\nWhy did U.S. News adjust for socioeconomic status?\n\nIn 2014, the National Quality Forum, an influential standard-setting body, recommended considering socioeconomic status in certain evaluations of hospital performance. Since our objective is to enable a patient consulting our ratings to make apples-to-apples comparisons among hospitals, it follows that we should adjust for patient attributes such as age, sex and socioeconomic status.\n\nDid U.S. News consider patient satisfaction?\n\nThe methodology uses one measure, how discharged patients rated a hospital overall, from the federal government's quarterly survey called Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems.\n\nWhat changes were made from last year?\n\nWe made several methodology changes, as described in this blog post.\n\nHow do the U.S. News ratings compare with other public reporting on hospital quality?\n\nIn judging the validity and usefulness of any public reporting effort to evaluate health facilities, patients should ask:\n\n\n\nWhat is its intention?\n\nWhat information does it claim to deliver?\n\nDoes it meet the stated intent?\n\nOur national Best Hospitals and Best Children's Hospitals rankings, for example, are meant to be used as guidance when life is in the balance or an uncommon condition or procedure is involved. Most patients, thankfully, will not need to consult them.\n\nBest Hospitals for procedures and conditions, on the other hand, rates the overall quality of inpatient care in the kinds of procedures and conditions that many hospitals commonly encounter. Clinical outcomes (such as mortality, readmissions and length of stay) are stressed, but other measures included are patient volume, patient satisfaction and hospital staffing data. Patients can choose to factor some or all of these individual quality indicators into their decisions about where to get care.\n\n2023-2024 Best Regional Hospitals, Published August 2023\n\nU.S. News first published Best Regional Hospitals in 2011. These state and metro area rankings offer information on community hospitals that are highly rated but may not be nationally ranked. Regional rankings are displayed for nearly every state and for the nation's largest metro areas, provided there is at least one Best Regional Hospital located there.\n\nThis year, 494 hospitals in 49 states and 92 metro areas were recognized as Best Regional Hospitals. There is no separate methodology report for the regional rankings, but additional information is contained at the end of the 2023-2024 U.S. News Best Hospitals Procedures & Conditions Ratings Methodology Report.\n\nWhat defines a Best Regional Hospital?\n\nA Best Regional Hospital is a hospital that:\n\n\n\nOffers a full range of general medical and surgical services (as opposed to a specialty hospital).\n\nEither was nationally ranked in one of the 11 data-driven Best Hospitals specialties (excluding rehabilitation) or had seven or more ratings of high performing in the Best Hospitals procedures and conditions. Note that for Best Regional Hospitals eligibility and scoring purposes, the TAVR and AVR cohorts were combined, and ovarian and uterine cancer surgeries were combined.\n\nhad seven or more ratings of high performing in the Best Hospitals procedures and conditions. Note that for Best Regional Hospitals eligibility and scoring purposes, the TAVR and AVR cohorts were combined, and ovarian and uterine cancer surgeries were combined. In addition to the eligibility criteria, a hospital must have had at least three more high-performing procedures/conditions than below-average procedures/conditions to be a Best Regional Hospital this year.\n\nNationwide, 494 hospitals were identified as Best Regional Hospitals, compared with 493 last year. The Best Hospitals for Maternity Care was not included in the Best Regional Hospitals calculation.\n\nHow was each Best Regional Hospital assigned its numerical ranking?\n\nIn a given region (state or major metro area), a hospital on the Best Hospitals Honor Roll outranked all other hospitals not on the Honor Roll, regardless of point totals. Where multiple Honor Roll hospitals are located in the same region, they are tied for No. 1 in that region. Other hospitals located in each region were ranked according to the number of points they earned: Hospitals earned two points for each of the 11 data-driven Best Hospitals specialties in which they were nationally ranked and one point for each of the 11 specialties (excluding rehabilitation) and 19 procedures and conditions in which they were rated high performing (AVR and TAVR are combined in this calculation, as are ovarian and uterine cancer surgery).\n\nIn addition, hospitals lost one point for each procedure or condition in which they were rated below average. In some circumstances, where a health system with multiple hospitals had consolidated a certain service at a regional center of excellence, we reassigned Best Regional Hospitals points for that service from the system's center of excellence to the system's flagship hospital.\n\nCan a specialty hospital, such as an orthopedic, cancer or children's hospital, be recognized as a Best Regional Hospital if it is nationally ranked or high performing?\n\nNo. The primary intent of the designation is to identify hospitals that perform well across a range of specialties, conditions and procedures. A specialty hospital's profile and its ratings and rankings pages show the area or areas of care in which it is ranked or high performing.\n\nIn which metropolitan areas and states were hospitals ranked?\n\nU.S. News generally used the U.S. Census Bureau list of Metropolitan Statistical Areas, or MSA, to define metro areas, but we departed from MSAs in cases where we used larger Combined Statistical Areas, or combined adjacent MSAs, to include nearby smaller cities with nationally ranked hospitals. For example, we used the Detroit CSA instead of the Detroit MSA; we combined the Durham-Chapel Hill and Raleigh-Cary MSAs to define the Raleigh-Durham metro area.\n\nSome metropolitan areas, such as Cincinnati, Kansas City and New York, cross state lines. Washington, D.C., is included as a metro area but not a state.\n\nWhat about hospitals in smaller metro areas or outside metro areas?\n\nU.S. News has grouped counties and county equivalents like parishes into approximately 200 regions that reflect geography, local custom and regional health care markets. High performers were recognized but not numerically ranked in regions that are not major metro areas.\n\nWhy weren't children's hospitals ranked in metro areas?\n\nVery few metro areas have more than one or two Best Children's Hospitals. That makes decisions about where to go for expert pediatric care simpler than for adult care; ranking small numbers of children's hospitals within a metro area wouldn't offer meaningful assistance. A Best Children's Hospitals FAQ is available below.\n\n2024 Best Hospitals for Maternity Care, Published December 2023\n\nRelatively little information is readily available to the public about which facilities across the country are best at caring for expectant parents during labor and delivery following an uncomplicated pregnancy. By evaluating hospitals using core maternity and perinatal care data, including data primarily self-reported by hospitals, and by publishing this information publicly on each hospital\u2019s usnews.com page, we aim to enhance the transparency of the maternity services provided for uncomplicated pregnancies. How U.S. News evaluated hospitals is addressed in this FAQ and a comprehensive methodology report is available as a downloadable PDF.\n\nThe Best Hospitals for Maternity Care differs from other procedures and conditions in a few important ways:\n\n\n\nDue to the lower age of the patients seeking maternity care, much of the data used in the methodology were collected directly from hospitals rather than from Medicare data.\n\nDue to this, only hospitals deemed high performing were recognized. Other hospitals that participated in the survey have a scorecard describing their performance on individual metrics but no recognition is displayed.\n\nAlongside the quality assessment are factors many new parents look for when choosing where to have a baby.\n\nHow did U.S. News evaluate hospitals in Maternity Care?\n\nFollowing U.S. News\u2019 Best Hospitals rankings and the procedure and condition ratings, Best Hospitals for Maternity Care draws the quality of care from three categories: outcomes, process and structure.\n\n\n\nOutcomes: 60%.\n\nC-section rates: 30%. Newborn complications rates: 25%. Episiotomy rates: 5%.\n\nProcess: 35%.\n\nEarly elective delivery rates: 5%. Exclusive breast milk feeding rates: 20%. Vaginal birth after cesarean rates: 5%. Transparency on racial/ethnic disparities: 5%.\n\n\n\nStructure: 5%.\n\nBirthing-friendly practice: 5%.\n\nMaternity Care Access Hospitals\n\nIn 2023, U.S. News & World Report began recognizing Maternity Care Access Hospitals, which provide maternity services to communities that might otherwise have inadequate access to maternity care. Hospitals are required to meet both geographic and quality criteria to be eligible. No recognition is displayed for participating hospitals not meeting geographic or quality criteria.\n\nTo meet geographic criteria, a hospital must be one of the following:\n\n\n\nThe only maternity care hospital providing maternity care within its county and located in a county with fewer than 60 obstetric providers per 10,000 births.\n\nThe only hospitals within a 15 mile radius and located in a county with fewer than 128 obstetric providers per 10,000 births.\n\nTo meet quality criteria, a hospital can not do either of the following:\n\nReceive the lowest score for the unexpected newborn complications, C-sections, early elective delivery, or episiotomy measure.\n\nReport an exclusive breast milk feeding rate of less than 21.2%.\n\nWhat data sources were used?\n\nIn the summer of 2023, U.S. News & World Report invited hospitals that offer maternity care to self-report their maternity data to U.S. News via an online survey, the Maternity Services Survey, hosted on the U.S. News Hospital Dashboard.\n\nPrimary data collection from hospitals was necessary because quality data available from other sources, such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, were insufficient on their own to evaluate the quality of maternal and neonatal care. Data collection took place over two months and began on June 7, 2023.\n\n2023-2024 Best Children's Hospitals, Published June 2023\n\nWhat is the purpose of the Best Children's Hospitals rankings? When should they be consulted? How are they determined? The following FAQ addresses these and other Best Children's Hospitals questions. A fully detailed methodology report is available as a downloadable PDF.\n\nFor the 2023-2024 rankings, U.S. News requested medical data and other information from nearly 200 facilities. Of those, 119 turned in enough data to be evaluated in at least one specialty, and 89 were ranked in one or more.\n\nWhy does U.S. News rank children's hospitals?\n\nRelatively few children, compared with the number of adults, face life-threatening or rare conditions or have to go through complicated operations. A typical hospital, where nearly all inpatients are adults, simply cannot provide the caliber of expertise needed by a severely ill child. Even a hospital with a busy maternity unit may not be equipped to deal with a newborn who weighs just a few pounds or requires surgery for a congenital heart defect. Similarly, most hospitals don't see large numbers of children with cancer, respiratory illnesses or kidney conditions.\n\nEven among children's hospitals and large pediatric services that do, the reality \u2013 as true in pediatrics as in adult care \u2013 is that some hospitals are better than others. That's why in 2006, U.S. News began collecting data that would allow ranking of pediatric centers on their ability to help children who need it the most.\n\nHow are the rankings organized and updated?\n\nThe 50 best-performing hospitals are ranked in each of 10 pediatric specialties. Unranked hospitals that provided enough information to be scored in a specialty are listed with their data but without rank or score. The rankings are updated annually in June. The Best Children's Hospitals Honor Roll recognizes the 10 hospitals that received the highest number of points, based on the number of specialties in which they are ranked and how high they ranked in each.\n\nWhat are the 10 specialties?\n\nCancer.\n\nCardiology and heart surgery.\n\nDiabetes and endocrinology.\n\nGastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery.\n\nNeonatology.\n\nNephrology.\n\nNeurology and neurosurgery.\n\nOrthopedics.\n\nPulmonology and lung surgery.\n\nUrology.\n\nSo, the rankings should just be a starting point?\n\nExactly. Families have to weigh many considerations when they seek care for a child, including the stress and expense of traveling to another city with a sick child and staying for days or possibly weeks, as well as an insurer's willingness to pay for care at a hospital outside its approved network.\n\nWithin a specialty, hospital performance is judged across a variety of conditions and procedures. So one hospital might outperform another in some of them, but the second might do better in others. In the pediatric orthopedic rankings, for example, one hospital might have an especially busy spina bifida clinic but doesn't treat complex fractures as efficiently as another hospital. Parents and caregivers must decide for themselves which factors they want to weigh more or less heavily. Kids and families are all different. There's no one-size-fits-all.\n\nHow is each hospital evaluated?\n\nA third of each hospital's score, or 33.3%, was tied to outcomes such as survival, infections and surgical complications. (In cardiology and heart surgery, outcomes counted for 38.3% because more and better data are available.) A hospital's reputation, based on an annual survey of pediatric specialists and subspecialists in each of the 10 specialties, made up another 10% (5% in cardiology and heart surgery).\n\nThe remaining portion of slightly more than 50% evaluated commitment to patient safety (such as the number of specific ways infections are minimized), excellence (such as the number of fellowship programs) and family centeredness (such as the degree to which families are involved in their children's care).\n\nWhy does U.S. News include hospital reputation?\n\nExperts' opinions can reflect important information that isn't evident in objective measurements. That's especially true in a field as full of nuance and complexity like the medical care of very sick children. We feel the opinions of pediatric specialists add to the objective measures that form the basis for the rankings.\n\nHow are the rankings organized?\n\nIn each of the 10 specialty areas, the 50 hospitals with the highest scores are ranked numerically based on their overall score. Keep in mind that a lower-ranked hospital may be better in certain specialties than a hospital with a higher overall ranking in that specialty \u2013 and, importantly, hospitals with different rankings may be effectively equivalent on the attributes that matter most to a particular family.\n\nYou can learn about the nuanced differences by comparing hospitals' detailed scorecards, which show many of the measures that went into hospital scores. Some measures, such as nurse-to-patient ratios, are common to all specialties. Others, like accreditation for bone marrow transplant, apply to just one or two specialties.\n\nIn addition to displaying performance information for the 50 ranked hospitals in each specialty, the same information is shown for unranked hospitals if they provided enough data through the clinical survey to be evaluated. The unranked hospitals are listed alphabetically.\n\nWhat are the regional Best Children's Hospital rankings?\n\nEach hospital that's ranked in at least one pediatric specialty, with two uncommon exclusions described here, is also assigned a ranking in its state and the multi-state region (there are seven) to which the state belongs. These regional rankings are intended to help families identify excellent pediatric centers near home.\n\nExclusions: Specialty pediatric hospitals, such as those that exclusively treat cancer, are excluded from the regional rankings. Additionally, a hospital that reports data for a specialty jointly with another hospital does not receive credit from that specialty toward a regional ranking unless the hospital is deemed by U.S. News to be the lead or co-lead hospital in that multi-hospital reporting relationship. Non-lead hospitals may be regionally ranked only if they are ranked on their own in another specialty or are the lead hospital in a joint reporting relationship in another specialty.\n\nA map accompanying this article shows the seven multi-state regions and which states each region comprises.\n\nWhat is the significance of the Honor Roll?\n\nThe Best Children's Hospitals Honor Roll recognizes 10 hospitals that are unusually competent in many specialties.\n\nHow is the Honor Roll determined?\n\nHospitals received points for being ranked in a specialty, and the 10 hospitals with the most points across the 10 specialties make up the Honor Roll. The first-ranked hospital in a specialty received 25 points, the second-ranked hospital received 24 points and so on, until reaching No. 21. All hospitals ranked 21 through 50 received five points. The Honor Roll would have been extended if multiple hospitals had tied for the tenth-most points overall.\n\nHow did U.S. News choose which children's hospitals to evaluate?\n\nSelection was determined initially by membership in the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, now called the Children's Hospital Association, or by nomination from teams of expert advisers. A hospital also can request to be considered. U.S. News makes such decisions not only on a hospital's willingness to engage in public reporting but also on the size and scope of its pediatric program.\n\nOf approximately 200 hospitals U.S. News invites to participate in the survey each year, about a quarter of the hospitals are freestanding pediatric-focused facilities. Most of the others are pediatric departments within larger full-service hospitals, allowing them to function almost like their own hospital within a hospital \u2013 with its own staff, operating rooms and support services.\n\nAre there changes from last year?\n\nYear to year, there are always changes \u2013 we constantly try to improve our methodology, using feedback we get from knowledgeable parents, doctors and health care leaders. Our approach is conservative, however, since any alterations in our analysis affect not only the new rankings but the ability to compare them with previous results. Some of this year's changes were highlighted in a U.S. News blog post published shortly before the rankings were released.\n\nHow does U.S. News decide what changes to make to the methodology?\n\nRTI International, a large North Carolina-based research and consulting firm that created the Best Children's Hospitals methodology in 2006 (and the U.S. News contractor for the Best Hospitals rankings), works with experts organized into specialized working groups to review and update the methodology each year. U.S. News editors review proposed changes and approve them before they take effect.\n\nWhy does U.S. News ask hospitals for data instead of using existing data sources?\n\nWe use existing data whenever we can. The lack of critical data that can be tapped to evaluate children's hospitals has been a huge challenge. There is no pediatric equivalent of the Medicare database U.S. News mines to measure hospital performance in the annual Best Hospitals adult rankings and ratings.\n\nIn 2006, when U.S. News began looking into the possibility of ranking pediatric centers, children's hospitals had barely begun to develop standards for care-related quality data or how to best analyze the results. That is still largely the case, despite the meaningful progress pediatric researchers have made in certain areas of performance measurement.\n\nSo, in 2006, U.S. News asked RTI to put together a clinical survey for children's hospitals. Some questions, such as nursing data and the extent and success of programs that prevent infection, touch on all 10 specialties. Others, such as complication rates of kidney biopsies and five-year survival rates for several types of cancer, are specialty-specific.\n\nWhat defines the three categories of quality measures \u2013 outcomes, process and structure \u2013 used in the rankings?\n\nOutcomes\n\nThese data reflect a hospital's ability to keep children alive, keep them safe from harm by protecting them from infections and surgical complications and improve the quality of life of children with chronic conditions. For example, we evaluate survival from three types of childhood cancers, bloodstream infections caused by central line catheters and success in managing severe asthma cases.\n\nProcess\n\nThe intent of the U.S. News process measure is to evaluate how well and efficiently a hospital goes about the day-to-day business of delivering care. That is determined in part by compliance with widely endorsed \"best practices,\" such as regular morbidity and mortality conferences to explore unanticipated deaths or complications, and commitment to infection control, such as having certified infection preventionists on staff and tracking the correct use of antibiotics prior to surgery. Additionally, hospitals' efforts to advance equity, diversity and inclusion of patients and staff factor into the rankings.\n\nIt's important to have such programs, but they must deliver. So, 10% of a hospital's score (5% in the cardiology and heart surgery rankings) relies on the opinions of pediatric specialists and subspecialists via an annual survey that asks them to name up to 10 hospitals in their specialty where they would send the sickest patients without taking location or expense into account. Responses are combined from the three latest surveys, meaning for the 2023-2024 rankings, surveys conducted in 2021, 2022 and 2023. More than 25,000 physicians were surveyed in 2023, and more than 6,000 responded.\n\nStructure\n\nThis category reflects resources a hospital makes available to patients, like the number of nurses caring for patients. We collect information on about 40 elements, many relevant to every specialty and others specific to just one. A few examples are the availability of surgery for congenital heart defects or for liver transplants, specialized clinics for children with diabetes or kidney disease and services for families that ease the anxiety of a child's hospital stay."}

(AP) \u2014 As Wesley Mlaskoch motored his snowmobile across a mountain in the Montana backcountry, the slope above him collapsed into a thick slab and began rushing down the hillside.\n\nHe had triggered an avalanche. Within seconds, the fury of accelerating snow flipped the snowmobile on top of him, threatening to bury Mlaskoch in the slide\u2019s debris.\n\nThe Willow River, Minnesota, man survived the recent accident near Yellowstone National Park after pulling a cord on his backpack to trigger an inflatable airbag specially designed for avalanches. It floated him higher in the moving white torrent so his head stayed above the surface as he came to a stop. His brother and several friends scrambled up the slope and used shovels to dig him out, according to Mlaskoch and the others.\n\nHe was shaken up but not hurt, and by the next morning, details of his misadventure were posted online as yet another cautionary tale by the Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center, one of many organizations working around the U.S. to forecast avalanche conditions and try to prevent accidents that kill about 30 people a year on average. Four people have died so far this winter, including one in a rare slide within the boundaries of a Lake Tahoe ski resort and skiers in backcountry areas of Idaho, Colorado and Wyoming.\n\n\u201cI remember when I first started coming here I was cocky, like \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen to me,\u2019\u201d Mlaskoch said, sitting on his snowmobile back in Cooke City, Montana, reliving his brush with tragedy. \u201cThen two hours into our first ride on our first day, it went south.\u201d\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nAvalanche safety specialists say their job has become more difficult in recent years as climate change brings extreme weather and surging numbers of skiers, snowboarders and snowmobilers visit backcountry areas since the pandemic.\n\nMore people means more chances to trigger fatal avalanches despite technological advances in safety equipment, including the airbag that saved Mlaskoch and kept him off the death tally for Cooke City. Avalanches in the area have killed 22 snowmobilers and 2 skiers since 1998, making it one of the deadliest locations for snowslides in the U.S.\n\nExperts say the potential for hazardous avalanches has set in for the winter for many mountain ranges. Scant snowfall across much of the U.S. West early in the season created an unstable layer at the bottom of the snowpack. That dangerous condition is likely to persist for months, said Doug Chabot, director of the Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center.\n\n\u201cThat weak layer, when we get snowfall on top of it, it\u2019s a house of cards,\u201d he said.\n\nChabot is among avalanche specialists scattered across the country bringing increased attention to the dangers of avalanches and teaching people how to stay safe. They say their work has helped keep deaths from spiking despite more skiers, snowboarders and snowmobilers pushing the limits on remote mountainsides.\n\nBreathtakingly steep terrain makes the Cooke City area particularly susceptible to avalanches. There\u2019s no ski patrol, and the best hope for rescue is your own partner or group.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re dug up in 10 minutes, you have an 80% chance of surviving,\u201d said Chabot. \u201cIt\u2019s not a smooth ride as you come down. You can hit rocks, you can hit trees, you can be traumatized, and even in the best case you\u2019re still looking at 20% of the people don\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nSouthwest Montana\u2019s Beartooth Mountains are inherently dangerous and there\u2019s no stopping people from putting their life on the line. Chabot\u2019s goal is to make sure they at least know what they\u2019re getting into. For 29 years he\u2019s observed the region\u2019s weather and visited backcountry sites to survey the snow conditions, gauge the danger and post avalanche forecasts.\n\nJust a few miles from where Mlaskoch nearly died and on the dame day, Chabot snowmobiled through the forest then clipped into skis to climb a steep slope. He steered wide of a funnel-shaped chute \u2014 hazardous terrain, its surface sliced up from recent snowmobile traffic \u2014 and worked his way higher. Reaching a clearing, he stopped, took out a lightweight shovel and started to dig.\n\nAs snow gets deeper, it can get denser and stronger. But as it goes through temperature changes \u2014 which are more likely and more dramatic when the snow is not deep, a variable that's shifting with climate change-induced droughts \u2014 it sometimes transforms into sugar-like crystals. Those crystals are quick to collapse when the weight above them gets too heavy, such as after a large snowfall or when the wind piles snow on one side of a mountain.\n\nTen minutes into his digging, Chabot struck ground 5 feet (1.5 meters) down. He tossed icy grains from the hole. \u201cYou see I\u2019m just shoveling sugar here,\u201d he said.\n\nHe used a saw to isolate a column of snow and then repeatedly hit the top of the column with his shovel, increasing the force until a slab of snow broke about 2 1/2 feet (76 centimeters) from the top. It broke along the same fragile layer where the slope collapsed beneath Mlaskoch \u2014 a weak zone pervading the surrounding snow fields.\n\nCooke City is thronged with tourists by the thousands in summer, when it\u2019s a bustling gateway to Yellowstone National Park. In the winter the mountain passes leading into town are closed and the community of fewer than 100 residents can be accessed only by driving all the way through Yellowstone from another entrance \u2014 a 55-mile (89-kilometer) journey past steaming hot springs, herds of bison and clutches of wildlife watchers huddled along the roadside in the cold.\n\nAfter it snows \u2014 and here storms are often measured by the foot \u2014 snowmobilers and skiers pack the few hotels and inns. Snow machines buzz up and down the main street, often with a skier or two in tow, holding tight to a rope as they\u2019re pulled into the Beartooths \u2014 41 granite peaks ringed with massive snow fields that loom over town.\n\nWith so many deaths in their small community, Cooke City\u2019s residents \u201ctake them personally,\u201d said Kay Whittle, who runs the Antlers Lodge inn and restaurant with her husband Bill. Both are longtime members of a local search and rescue team that musters after accidents to help find and dig out fatal avalanche victims. Kay Whittle is also an EMT and deputy county coroner, tasking her with calling family members of the dead.\n\nShe and other business owners in recent years started more aggressively pushing their advice about avalanches, holding weekly public safety briefings at the Antlers Lodge that are promoted with flyers and by word of mouth in Cooke City's hotels, restaurants, rental shops and two gas stations. On Saturdays at a backcountry warming hut used by snowmobilers, avalanche educators give basic rescue lessons including how to use avalanche beacons \u2014 transmitters that send a signal rescuers can use to find victims.\n\nThe equipment is expensive, but Mlaskovich attests that it\u2019s worth it \u2014 and some local outfitters now mandate the gear before taking people out on trips.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure these guys get tired of hearing, you know, listening to us preach to them about safety, but it\u2019s gotta be done,\u201d said Shannon Abelseth, a snowmobile outfitter in Cooke City. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to send people home in body bags.\u201d"}

(AP) \u2014 The changes railroads announced after last year's fiery crash in East Palestine, Ohio, haven\u2019t yet made a major difference, statistics show, and reforms have stalled in Congress.\n\nA few key measures in the latest Federal Railroad Administration statistics, including the total number of train accidents, worsened over the first 11 months of last year compared to the same period in previous years. Meanwhile there were some improvements with other numbers, like total derailments.\n\nThe overall picture is that rail safety hasn\u2019t significantly improved in recent years \u2014 and as the Norfolk Southern derailment in East Palestine last Feb. 3 and others demonstrate, just one derailment can be disastrous when hazardous chemicals are involved. The small town near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border is still struggling to recover a year later.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said there was a meaningful 15% decrease in derailments along mainline tracks after Congress responded to a number of high-profile train crashes involving crude oil in the early 2010s. \"Progress has plateaued as derailments and preventable incidents are happening at an unacceptable rate,\u201d Buttigieg said, urging Congress to pass the reforms now.\n\nThe railroad industry defends its record as the safest way to transport hazardous materials over land \u2014 something the head of the National Transportation Safety Board agreed with in recent testimony in the House \u2014 though officials acknowledge the railroads need to continue improving safety. And the Association of American Railroads trade group says most of the measures railroads promised to take last spring weren\u2019t completed until late last year, so they aren\u2019t yet reflected in the numbers.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nWhat's the industry\u2019s safety record?\n\nSafety statistics are mixed for the six biggest freight railroads that dominate the industry \u2014 Norfolk Southern, CSX, Union Pacific, CPKC, Canadian National and BNSF.\n\nFor the majority of 2023 the total number of train accidents increased slightly to 4,845, including more than 600 deaths.\n\nWhen comparing 2022 and 2023, the total number of derailments declined about 2.6% \u2014 but there were still nearly three derailments a day nationwide. Railroads point out that roughly two-thirds of those crashes happen at slow speeds in railyards and don\u2019t cause significant damage.\n\nHow many costly derailments are there?\n\nThere were 53 major derailments last year causing damage over $1 million, a surge of nearly 33%. Norfolk Southern has said the cost of the East Palestine derailment has already topped $1.1 billion, and that total will continue to grow with cleanup costs and lawsuit settlements.\n\nThe number of total crashes caused by the same issue as the eastern Ohio derailment more than doubled nationwide last year to 19. Overheating bearing failures remain a small fraction representing less than 2% of all accidents.\n\nAre railroads getting riskier?\n\nAll 13 railroad unions have sounded the alarm about the dangers of the lean operating model that has cut roughly one-third of the industry's rail jobs. The unions say that as a result of these cuts, inspections are rushed \u2014 or done by less qualified workers \u2014 and everyone remaining is overworked. They also say companies may be neglecting to do preventative maintenance.\n\n\u201cEast Palestine was no surprise,\u201d said Jared Cassity, the safety chief at the SMART-TD union, which represents conductors. \u201cThe next East Palestine, at least at this pace that we\u2019re going, is imminent to some degree.\u201d\n\nThe railroads defend their operating model \u2014 which relies on fewer trains that have grown much longer \u2014 as simply helping them make the best use of their locomotives, tracks and crews without jeopardizing safety, and the Federal Railroad Administration says safety statistics haven\u2019t gotten significantly worse since they started using it.\n\nBut Tony Cardwell who leads the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union, which represents track maintenance workers, said the railroads are under pressure to cut costs from \u201cvulture capitalist\u201d investors.\n\nOver the past year, the railroads have agreed to provide paid sick leave to most of their workers for the first time and improve the way engineers and conductors are scheduled in order to help reduce fatigue.\n\nWhat have railroads done to improve safety?\n\nLast year, the major freight railroads installed hundreds of new trackside detectors to spot overheating bearings, as part of their goal of adding roughly 1,000 of those nationwide to make the average spacing between them 15 miles (24 kilometers) in most places.\n\nAll railroads will now stop trains when bearings detect a gap of more than 170 degrees from the outside air, and there are new standards to help them better track when bearings start to heat up to catch issues sooner.\n\nRailroads have also been installing complex portals filled with cameras, other sensors and advanced detectors to spot problems as they\u2019re moving.\n\nNorfolk Southern also took additional steps like hiring a consultant from the nuclear power industry to review its safety practices, establishing a pilot program so employees can anonymously report safety concerns and changing rules for train assembly to better balance the weight of heavy cars and hazardous materials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to strive to get better at safety,\u201d Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw told The Associated Press. \u201cThere\u2019s no one thing that you do. It\u2019s a bunch of different things.\"\n\nWhy hasn\u2019t Congress acted?\n\nThe railroad safety act has yet to get a vote in the full Senate \u2014 or even a hearing in the House. The measure would call for the creation of federal standards for those trackside detectors, increased inspections by qualified employees and two-person crews on every freight train.\n\nIan Jefferies with the AAR trade group says railroads haven\u2019t opposed the bill outright \u2014 but they are fighting several provisions like the two-man crew requirement and locomotive inspection rules. They say such changes aren't related to what caused the East Palestine wreck. After all, that train had three crew members, and the railcar \u2014 not a locomotive \u2014 had the flaw. The railroads also want a cost-benefit analysis to be done on the rules.\n\nHouse Republicans say they want to wait for the final NTSB report before they act, so they can be sure that any new regulations are directly related to the cause of the East Palestine derailment. The report won\u2019t be out until sometime this summer.\n\nDemocratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who was part of the bipartisan group that proposed the bill, blames railroad industry lobbying from keeping the act from advancing.\n\n\u201cIt goes down to the power of the rail industry. I mean the fact that Norfolk Southern and other railroads have continued to oppose this bill,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey\u2019ve always put profits over people.\u201d"}

(AP) \u2014 When California Sen. Mike McGuire takes over as leader of the state Senate on Monday, it will be the first time in decades that the state\u2019s top two legislative leaders aren\u2019t from a major urban center.\n\nBut McGuire says the issues that most afflict rural districts like his \u2014 including childhood poverty, opioid addiction and housing shortages \u2014 resonate with the 39 million people living across the state.\n\n\u201cEverything that I just mentioned are concerns of Californians in Eureka and concerns of Californians in Los Angeles,\u201d McGuire said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.\n\nMcGuire, 44, comes from a family of prune farmers and was first elected to public office in 1998, when he won a school board seat in the small city of Healdsburg. He was elected to the state Senate in 2014 and has since authored legislation to protect marine life, support cannabis farmers, make cellphone service more reliable during power outages and fight the impacts of wildfires, an issue that hits close to home.\n\nThe Democrat\u2019s district spans from just north of the Golden Gate Bridge to the Oregon border.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nMcGuire will succeed state Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins, a San Diego Democrat who recently announced her bid for governor in 2026.\n\nAs Senate pro tem, McGuire will be one of the most powerful politicians in California as he helps drive decisions about which policies make their way through the Legislature and appoints lawmakers to key committees. He will lead the Senate for two years before terming out of the Legislature in 2026.\n\nAll the while, McGuire will work with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Assembly on the state budget. He will have to balance the reality of the state\u2019s projected budget deficit of nearly $38 billion with ambitious proposals from his caucus, including a bill by state Sen. Steven Bradford of Los Angeles to create an agency that would help Black families research their family lineage.\n\nHe will lead alongside Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat from a rural part of California\u2019s central coast. While McGuire grew up in a farming family, Rivas was the grandson of farmworkers.\n\nRivas, who was sworn into his leadership post in June, said recently that he first met McGuire at a 2010 California State Association of Counties training for new supervisors while McGuire was representing Sonoma County and Rivas was representing San Benito County.\n\n\u201cWe share a lot of the same priorities and experiences,\u201d Rivas said.\n\nWhile they hail from rural areas, the two lawmakers continue to market themselves as leaders who will champion issues, from housing to education and climate, that are seen as priorities up and down the state.\n\nChris Lopez, who chairs the policy group Rural County Representatives of California, is proud to see lawmakers from rural areas lead both chambers of the Legislature. He hopes they pass legislation to expand broadband access.\n\n\u201cWe know that while the policy may not always go our way, that in the back of their minds, they have considered us, because they have walked in our shoes,\u201d Lopez said.\n\nThe last time a lawmaker representing McGuire's region led the Senate was in 1866, while the last Senate leader from a plant farming background was from 1894 to 1903, said Alex Vassar, a legislative historian at the California State Library.\n\nMcGuire was raised primarily by his mother and grandmother in Sonoma County, a popular wine region. McGuire\u2019s grandmother, who ran his family\u2019s prune-turned-grape ranch, taught him to \u201cwork hard, work together\u201d and to \u201cnever take no for an answer for the issues that you believe in,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt my core, I believe that we have to focus on policies that affect people\u2019s everyday lives,\u201d McGuire said.\n\nMcGuire has spoken in broad strokes about wanting to address California\u2019s persistent homelessness crisis and continue the state\u2019s ambitious climate goals, but he and his team have been light on policy specifics as he prepares for the new job.\n\nPolicy advocates and fellow lawmakers described McGuire as an honest, hard-working leader who is willing to listen to a variety of opinions.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a Republican representing part of San Diego County, said he has a good working relationship with McGuire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making sure that millions of California voices are being heard, and Mike McGuire is very respectful of that,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s respectful of our opinions even when he disagrees with them.\u201d\n\nKristina Bas Hamilton, a longtime labor lobbyist in Sacramento, doesn\u2019t think McGuire\u2019s leadership style and politics will differ greatly from his predecessor. She said they are both \u201cdown-to-earth lawmakers that have always been accessible and open doors to conversations.\u201d\n\nMcGuire\u2019s smooth transition into Senate power stands in contrast to a chaotic handoff to Rivas from former Speaker Anthony Rendon. McGuire will step into the role with no prior experience in the Assembly, a departure from many of his predecessors, including Atkins, who was previously the Assembly Speaker.\n\nMcGuire said he was dismissed due to his age when he was first elected to the Healdsburg school board at age 19. At one meeting, a fellow board member patted him on the head and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t he cute?\u201d he recalled.\n\n\u201cObviously, that was quite upsetting,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cBut I always accept a challenge.\u201d\n\nMcGuire later served on the Healdsburg City Council before election to the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors in 2010. Supervisor David Rabbitt, who served alongside McGuire, said he can call McGuire up, ask him whether a policy will get passed and McGuire will set realistic expectations.\n\n\u201cFor me, that\u2019s kind of a golden type of relationship to have, where we don\u2019t have to kind of play the political games with one another,\u201d Rabbitt said. \u201cI think that actually has been the secret to his success.\u201d\n\n___ Austin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Ambassador Nikki Haley. While McDaniel has fought off opponents before, winning a competitive race for a fourth term as chairwoman last year, she's now facing Trump supporters on the far right who are creating parallel efforts that could conflict with the national party.\n\nCampaign finance disclosures released this week show the RNC had just $8 million in the bank and $1 million in debt. While the Trump campaign heads into 2024 with $42 million cash on hand, Biden's political operation reported raising $97.1 million in the final months of 2024 across the various committees it uses to fundraise and ended the year with $117.4 million on hand.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nBiden is already working with the Democratic National Committee, which partners automatically with the incumbent president. An effort by Trump allies to have the RNC this week declare Trump the \u201cpresumptive nominee\u201d was withdrawn after it drew criticism because Haley is still running.\n\nTrump has previously backed McDaniel, though his campaign and the RNC have disagreed at times. Trump declined to participate in party-sponsored primary debates before this year's Iowa caucuses.\n\nBut there's long been tension between the party establishment and some people who consider themselves Trump's strongest supporters.\n\nDays before the party\u2019s winter meeting convened, Turning Point hosted a counterprograming event and training session at a casino across Las Vegas Boulevard dubbed \u201cRestoring National Confidence,\" a play on the RNC's initials. The invite-only event drew nearly 400 attendees aligned with the group, including some RNC members, as well as state and local Republican Party chairs.\n\nKirk, who hosts a popular radio show, is part of a faction of conservatives who've openly stoked a feud with the RNC, which they have blasted for spending lavishly and being out of touch with the party's grassroots base. That, they argue, led to losses in 2018 and 2020 as well as underwhelming results in 2022.\n\nSome Turning Point supporters have become RNC members, while the group is actively recruiting others, an effort that, if successful, would give the group more sway over the direction of the party and perhaps a stronger say in the party\u2019s chair.\n\n\u201cWe know a pack of losers when we see it: top to bottom, the entire RNC staff in its current form,\" Kirk said Thursday on his radio show.\n\n\"They don\u2019t even know what winning is,\u201d he added.\n\nInside the RNC meeting, some members, including those who have been critical of McDaniel, said the Turning Point effort was ill-advised.\n\n\u201cAttacking the brand and the chair doesn't advance our fundamental goal of winning elections,\u201d said Mississippi national committeeman Henry Barbour, who has at times criticized McDaniel.\n\nAnd McDaniel's allies note that the Democratic National Committee was in debt to the tune of $5 million in the early days of the 2020 race, when the party was trying to return a Democrat to the White House.\n\nTurning Point is looking to expand its influence and reach beyond the youth movement, with mixed results. The group has struggled in its adopted home state of Arizona, where many of its preferred candidates failed to win in statewide races that many saw as winnable.\n\nIts leaders have also come under scrutiny over their own spending practices, including charter jet travel, offering lucrative salaries and paying to host Kirk's wedding reception in 2021. Turning Point is currently trying to raise $108 million for a three-state get-out-the-vote campaign in Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia that would operate parallel to efforts that are already underway.\n\nRNC spokeswoman Emma Vaughn dismissed the challenges as coming from people complaining online.\n\n\u201cOutside noise might be what keyboard warriors and the Democrats are focused on,\u201d she said. \u201cChairwoman Ronna McDaniel and the entire Republican National Committee are laser-focused on beating Biden this fall.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSlodysko reported from Washington."}

Officials plan to hold a memorial service for them on Saturday.\n\nThe university says it is trying to begin rectifying past wrongs. But some community members feel excluded from the process, illustrating the challenges that institutions face in addressing institutional racism.\n\n\u201cRepatriation should be part of what the museum does, and we should embrace it,\u201d said Christopher Woods, the museum\u2019s director.\n\nThe university houses more than 1,000 human remains from all over the world, and Woods said repatriating those identified as from the local community felt like the best place to start.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nSome leaders and advocates for the affected Black communities in Philadelphia have pushed back against the plan for years. They say the decision to reinter the remains in Eden Cemetery, a local historic Black cemetery, was made without their input.\n\nWest Philadelphia native and community activist Abdul-Aliy A. Muhammad said justice isn\u2019t just the university doing the right thing, it\u2019s letting the community decide what that should look like.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not repatriation. We\u2019re saying that Christopher Woods does not get to decide to do that,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cThe same institution that has been holding and exerting control for years over these captive ancestors is not the same institution that can give them ceremony.\u201d\n\nAs the racial justice movement has swept across the country in recent years, many museums and universities have begun to prioritize the repatriation of collections that were either stolen or taken under unethical circumstances. But only one group of people often harmed by archeology and anthropology, Native Americans, have a federal law that regulates this process.\n\nIn cases like that between the University of Pennsylvania and Black Philadelphians, institutions maintain control over the collections and how they are returned.\n\nThe remains of the Black Philadelphians were part of the Morton Cranial Collection at the Penn Museum. Beginning in the 1830s, physician and professor Samuel George Morton collected about 900 crania, and after his death the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia added hundreds more.\n\nMorton\u2019s goal with the collection was to prove \u2014 by measuring crania \u2014 that the races were actually different species of humans, with white being the superior species. His racist pseudoscience influenced generations of scientific research and was used to justify slavery in the antebellum South.\n\nMorton also was a medical professor in Philadelphia, where most doctors of his time trained, said Lyra Monteiro, an anthropological archaeologist and professor at Rutgers University. The vestiges of his since-disproven work are still evident across the medical field, she said.\n\n\u201cMedical racism can really exist on the back of that,\u201d Monteiro said. \u201cHis ideas became part of how medical students were trained.\u201d\n\nThe collection has been housed at the university since 1966, and some of the remains were used for teaching as late as 2020. The university issued an apology in 2021 and revised its protocol for handling human remains.\n\nThe university also formed an advisory committee to decide next steps. The group decided to rebury the remains at Eden Cemetery. The following year, the university successfully petitioned the Philadelphia Orphans\u2019 Court to allow the burial on the basis that the identities of all but one of the Black Philadelphians were unknown.\n\nCritics note the advisory committee was comprised almost entirely of university officials and local religious leaders, rather than other community members.\n\nMonteiro and other researchers challenged the idea that the identities of the Philadelphians were lost to time. Through the city's public archives, she discovered that one of the men\u2019s mothers was Native American. His remains must be repatriated through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the federal law regulating the return of Native American ancestral remains and funerary objects, she said.\n\n\u201cThey never did any research themselves on who these people were, they took Morton\u2019s word for it,\u201d Monteiro said. \u201cThe people who aren\u2019t even willing to do the research should not be doing this.\u201d\n\nThe university removed that cranium from the reburial so it can be assessed for return through NAGPRA. Monteiro and others were further outraged to discover the university had already interred the remains of the other Black Philadelphians last weekend outside of public view, she said.\n\nMembers of the Black Philadelphians Descendant Community Group, which was organized by people including Muhammed who identify as descendants of the individuals in the mausoleum, said in a statment they are \u201cdevastated & hurt\u201d that the burial took place without them.\n\n\u201cIn light of this new information, they are taking time to process and consider how best to honor their ancestors at a future time,\" the group said, adding that members plan to offer handouts at Saturday's memorial with information they have gathered on the individuals in the mausoleum.\n\n\u201cTo balance prioritizing the human dignity of the individuals with conservation due diligence and the logistical requirements of Historic Eden Cemetery, laying to rest the 19 Black Philadelphians was scheduled ahead of the interfaith ceremony and blessing,\u201d the Penn Museum said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nWoods said he believes most of the community is happy with the decision to reinter the remains at Eden Cemetery, and it is a vocal minority in opposition. He hopes that eventually all the individuals in the mausoleum will be identified and returned.\n\n\u201cWe encourage research to be done moving forward,\u201d Woods said, noting the remains of the Black Philadelphians were in the collection for two centuries and, along with his staff, he felt the need to take more immediate action with those remains.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not let these individuals sit in the museum storeroom and extend those 200 years anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if all the crania are identified and returned to the community, the university has a long way to go. More than 300 Native American remains in the Morton Cranial Collection still need to be repatriated through the federal law. Woods said the museum recently hired additional staff to expedite that process.\n\n___\n\nGraham Brewer is a member of AP's Race and Ethnicity team. Follow him on social media."}

(AP) \u2014 An 11-day strike by teachers in a Boston suburb ended Friday night after their union and the school district tentatively agreed on a new contract.\n\n\u201cWe have great news for the students, families, caregivers, residents and educators of Newton. We expect schools to be open Monday,\u201d the Newton Teachers Association said in a late-night social media post announcing the deal.\n\nThe walkout beginning Jan. 19 affected 2,000 Newton Public Schools instructors in about two dozen schools with some 12,000 students. It was the sixth teachers strike in the state since 2022 and the longest, closing schools for 11 days.\n\nThe union said it sought living wages for all employees and struck after more than a year of talks with the Newton School Committee, which negotiated on behalf of the district.\n\nUnion bargainer Ryan Normandin proclaimed victory at a nighttime news conference before cheering teachers who were bundled against the chilly weather.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\n\u201cWe taught our students not to be afraid that when those in power try to take away your rights, that they should stand up for themselves, that they should not do it alone, but together,\u201d Normandin said. \u201cWe taught every other district in this state, what will happen if they try to balance their budgets on the backs of our students and educators.\u201d\n\nThe agreement still must be approved by the school committee and the union members. Both sides were expected to ratify the deal this weekend.\n\nThe walkout sidelined students and prompted bitterness in the mostly affluent suburb of about 87,000 residents.\n\nNewton parent Trevor Mack called the deal \u201clong overdue\u201d and \u201cavoidable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single party that won in this strike,\u201d Mack, father of an 8-year-old daughter, told The Boston Globe. The union and school committee \u201clost my trust very early on in their very negative tone and rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThe walkout also proved costly for both sides.\n\nIn addition to salary losses, a judge fined the teachers association more than $600,000 for violating the state\u2019s ban on strikes by public workers and on Friday threatened to double daily fines to $100,000 if no agreement was reached by Sunday.\n\nThe school district, meanwhile, was expected to spend an additional $53 million over four years to cover the new agreement, which includes a cost-of-living increase of about 13% over that period for teachers, pay hikes for classroom aides and 40 days of fully paid family leave time.\n\nDistrict negotiators said it also had racked up more than $1 million in court and other costs since the walkout began.\n\n\u201cThis contract reflects our values including respect for our educators,\u201d the Newton School Committee said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis strike has been painful for NPS families and the entire City of Newton. The Committee looks forward to the return of students to their classrooms,\" the statement said. \"We will take a breath, then begin the work of ensuring that this never happens again.\u201d\n\nBy the eighth day of the strike on Tuesday, tensions had racheted up.\n\nParent Lital Asher-Dotan filed a lawsuit on Monday in Middlesex District Court. The Newton mother of three, including two high schoolers and a student in eighth grade, asked the court to compel the teachers union to end the walkout.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Asher-Dotan said one of her children is facing setbacks during a critical high school year that could jeopardize her chance of college acceptance. She said her children also have missed part of the hockey season and opportunities with the ski team club.\n\n\u201cThe prolonged strike exacerbates these issues, especially for students with special needs,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nOther parents started an online petition urging the union and city \u201cto continue your negotiations while enabling students and teachers to get back to the classroom.\u201d"}

Fran is a woman content in her mostly solitary life, apart from her co-workers in her chatty office. But when an attraction to a new colleague challenges her to take risks and push through social awkwardness to make a connection.\n\nThe film, in theaters now, is directed by Rachel Lambert and co-stars comedian Dave Merheje and several other comedic actors, who improvise watercooler talk to big laughs. )Ridley says she often had to stifle her laughter to stay in character.)\n\nThe Associated Press recently spoke to Ridley about finding Fran, reprising her role as Rey in a new \u201cStar Wars\u201d film, and perfecting her death stare. Answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nAP: The film\u2019s title makes it sound gloomy, but it\u2019s actually a comedy, right?\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nRIDLEY: There was a lot more humor than anyone is expecting because the title gives a feeling that it\u2019s going to be more of a melancholic sort of feeling. But there is a lot of humor and Fran is pretty funny. But also the world that she lives in is full of vibrancy and the office space is very gregarious and loud and fun, so it\u2019s a nice world for her to live in, even though she is struggling to make connections occasionally.\n\nAP: Fran\u2019s outsider view puts the office setting and people under a microscope \u2014 did that amuse you?\n\nRIDLEY: I loved the world and I loved the office but, actually, a lot of that was improvised. Rachel talks about how much she loves working with comedians because there\u2019s such an ease with improvisation. The first scene we filmed was around the table in the conference room, and Rachel just let people fly and it was such a great way to bring everyone together. Fran loves to be at work. She loves her routine. But also she is sometimes a little judgmental of the people around her. So it\u2019s not just that she\u2019s struggling. Sometimes she\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of it.\u201d I think it\u2019s very human, like two things can be true at the same time.\n\nAP: You perfected your death stare for the fantasy scenes \u2014 was that challenging?\n\nRIDLEY: The beach was cold! And the main thing really was trying not to shiver. So that was \u201cplease don\u2019t shiver, please don\u2019t move.\u201d And then lying in the forest was tricky because I had a handful of bugs and it was like icky icky icky.\n\nThank you for the compliment about my death stare, I don\u2019t know how I managed that well (laughs). It sounds so messed up. An absence of thought, which is obviously a contrast, because I had so much thinking when I was playing her. So in those moments, it was about the absence of any of that and the sort of calm, quiet time.\n\nAP: This was your first time producing \u2014 how was that experience?\n\nRIDLEY: It was a generous give of the producer credit (laughs). I did come on early so there was a sense that we all had to hold hands and say, \u201cOK, this is what we\u2019re going to do, and this is how we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d I was asked about various creative things, but Rachel made it so easy. And then from landing in Portland, (Oregon,) I was just an actor. There was no feeling of responsibility \u2014 bar from my own performance and being part of a company of people, which was wonderful. But there were a lot of lessons I learned on set because there were a group of people who made the film together and they were very generous with me, talking about budget and scheduling \u2014 so that actually facilitated me making my own movie, because I knew what could be done.\n\nAP: Knowing you can\u2019t say much about the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie,what excites you most about it?\n\nRIDLEY: I\u2019m excited about the story. I didn\u2019t think it would happen that I would go back now. I thought maybe it would at some point, like in the faraway future. But I think the story is great and will appeal to the people that love it, and people who are maybe not as familiar with it. I think it will be a worthwhile adventure (smiles).\n\nAP: You were so young on the last one; how will this be different?\n\nRIDLEY: I was the baby! Now I feel more like a grown-up. It\u2019s going to be so strange because I\u2019m not going to be the baby anymore. But also, that\u2019s sort of an exciting adventure of like, OK, how is this going to be \u2014 a different filmmaker, different writer, different crew, different cast? It will be such its own thing with its own thumbprint on it. It will be interesting.\n\nAP: Who on that set gave you advice or helped you learn about the business?\n\nRIDLEY: I\u2019m the person that is always too embarrassed to ask questions. So I pretend I\u2019m not fussed at all that I\u2019m, like, next to Harrison Ford (laughs)! I think J.J. (Abrams) particularly, I will always think of in such a wonderful way because it\u2019s such an intimate relationship, the one between actor and director, and the one between actor and cameraman. We had this amazing camera operator called Colin and there\u2019s always such protection with the hair and makeup team and the costume team because, again, it\u2019s so intimate. You go in at 5 in the morning and people are in your space, helping guide you and helping you feel ready to be seen eventually on an IMAX (screen). And actors. There was a lot of kindness from all places."}

But if Nadine Dorries is right, one Conservative adviser has the power to elevate and overthrow prime ministers and has been exercising it for two decades.\n\nSome might accuse Dorries of hyperbole. But even to more reserved figures in the Conservative party, the Tory fixer Dougie Smith is a mysterious and unnerving character.\n\nHe has been employed in an undefined role under successive Tory prime ministers including David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. Former colleagues who have encountered him in government describe feeling unsure what his job was and to whom he was answerable.\n\nUsed to operating in the shadows, Smith now finds himself in the spotlight after reports he has been advising a group plotting to replace Rishi Sunak before the next election. \u201cHe definitely wants Rishi out,\u201d one Tory insider said.\n\nIt seems an extraordinary situation that someone who is apparently employed by the Conservative party is being accused of working to overthrow its leader. Tories\u2019 answer to the obvious question \u2013 why doesn\u2019t Sunak just sack Smith? \u2013 is that he has been around too long and knows where all the bodies are buried.\n\nLittle information about Smith is publicly available. Though he has worked for the Conservative party since around 2002, there are no records of his education and employment history online and he does not appear on the government\u2019s list of special advisers. A Telegraph profile in 2022 reported that he was born in an Edinburgh suburb in May 1962 and studied at the University of Strathclyde but dropped out before his final year.\n\nIn Westminster, perhaps the most often-cited fact about him is that he reportedly organised swingers\u2019 sex parties for wealthy clients in the 1990s and early 2000s. When this was exposed in a national newspaper, Smith insisted that his political and private activities \u201cdon\u2019t overlap\u201d and even boasted that his clients were like \u201cthe SAS of sex\u201d.\n\nAsked about reports that Smith was now involved in a plot against the prime minister, Sunak\u2019s press secretary told reporters on Wednesday: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of speculation around \u2026 All I can say in terms of the government side and what the PM\u2019s focused on is that we\u2019re getting on with the day job.\u201d Conservative Campaign Headquarters was approached and said it did not comment on HR issues.\n\nIn her book The Plot, Dorries claims Sunak is just the latest in a long line of Tory leaders Smith has targeted. Others who have worked with him say the reason he has been part of Tory furniture for so long \u2013 despite turnover at the top of the party \u2013 is that successive leaders have benefited from his political instincts and deep knowledge of the party and its membership.\n\nA former adviser in Johnson\u2019s government said Smith\u2019s status as a \u201clegacy\u201d figure in the party gave him authority in government. \u201cHe would dip in and out of things he was interested in,\u201d they said. \u201cHe had that quite rare ability to walk into a room and have no one ask: \u2018What are you doing here? What is your interest in this?\u2019\u201d\n\nOne of his focus areas, according to the same aide, was helping Johnson avoid potential bear traps. \u201cWe\u2019d be in a position where something could land the PM in shit and we\u2019d need to sort something out. Then Dougie would appear and he would offer some views and some strategy.\u201d\n\nSmith would also liaise with Tory MPs and he was for a time tasked with what the aide described as \u201cCarrie [Johnson] management\u201d. \u201cIn the early days when Carrie was having issues \u2013 which were broadly \u2018there\u2019s too much interest in me, how do I manage this?\u2019 \u2013 he became her person for a while,\u201d they said.\n\nSmith\u2019s loyalty to Boris Johnson appears to have eventually waned. Dorries\u2019 book includes an interview with Johnson who told her that in 2021 Smith called him and allegedly told him to resign because he was \u201cpoison like Nixon\u201d.\n\nSmith\u2019s wife, Munira Mirza, who worked as Johnson\u2019s policy chief in Downing Street, quit in 2022, attacking Johnson\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that Keir Starmer had allowed Jimmy Savile to escape justice while he was director of public prosecutions.\n\nSmith and Mirza are interested in social and cultural debates, including on race and gender. The Tory insider cited above said Smith was \u201cobsessed with woke issues\u201d.\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising then that he has been linked to Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary and Tory culture warrior, amid claims that the plotters want to make her party leader.\n\nA third former special adviser recalls suspicions during Johnson\u2019s government that Smith was trying to get Badenoch installed as education secretary. \u201cHe and Munira saw education as a place to fight culture wars and push back against progressive, trendy stuff,\u201d they said.\n\nIf somehow Badenoch comes to replace Sunak with Smith\u2019s help, one of the claims in Dorries\u2019 book will come true. Or as the same adviser put it: \u201cMaybe she\u2019s not in the fiction section after all.\u201d"}

So, Love Island: it was such a clean, neat format \u2013 put the hottest people from every mid-size town in Britain in a villa for a month and a half, take away their concept of time, make them half-naked and bored, and watch how they fill the hours with drama. Despite it peaking from 2017 to 2022, there have been three series since the Davide and Ekin-Su summer (Maya Jama hosts it now, if you even care!) \u2013 but the fizz has faded from the prosecco.

No. Mainly because they probably started the production process when Love Island was still watched and good, and now it isn\u2019t, but it\u2019s too late to unattend all those meetings and decommission all those shows.\n\nAnd so to Hot Mess Summer (Prime Video, from 7 February), which probably seemed like a good idea in 2022. The idea is this: eight young British people with inexplicable rib tattoos are sent to Zante. They are promised a summer of mess, chaos, partying and boozing \u2013 a Geordie Shore reboot, essentially \u2013 but then Rylan stalks into frame like a big cat. \u201cYou\u2019re not here to do a Geordie Shore reboot,\u201d he solemnly tells them, more or less. \u201cYou\u2019re here to work in the biggest bar in Zante for a summer, and all your mates nominated you to do this, for some reason.

Clean that toilet and don\u2019t drink on the job.\u201d He turns on the spot and leaves. The eight young British people with rib tattoos are left in the charge of their iron-fist boss, Lee.

They all laugh in his face.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018You\u2019re not here to do a Geordie Shore reboot\u2019 \u2026 the eight contestants on Hot Mess Summer.

It\u2019s a lot of everything: the promise of Geordie Shore British drunk chaos, the paradise servitude of Ibiza Weekender, the spiritual \u201cthe youth must pay for the sin of joy with hard work\u201d energy of Lads Army or Sun, Sex and Suspicious Parents. There is something indelibly British about a show like this \u2013 the idea that young people must be punished for living a life too happy or free, and the only way through that is low and humiliating work. Hot Mess Summer is a logical extension of the argument that we should bring back national service. They don\u2019t know they\u2019re born, these days, young people, do they? They all \u2026 go to the gym, or get haircuts. Nah, let\u2019s sort them out. Make them miserable, like us.\n\nI think misery is the problem in a format like this: I do not, personally, like watching people be miserable, or having to adhere blindly to rules, or being punished for silly misdemeanours. But that\u2019s all Hot Mess Summer really is. Episode one sees Lee \u2013 whose talking heads involve him telling us how good service is actually really important, and holding a tray just so is really important, and how drinking on the job is the greatest crime a person working at a bar in Zante in the red heat of the sun could possibly commit \u2013 try to teach them all how to make a vodka-coke, put a napkin down, and serve it to a customer. The eight young British people with inexplicable rib tattoos sneak drinks when his back is turned. He curtly goes \u201cNo!\u201d and snatches the glass away from them. That\u2019s it for 10 minutes. Why am I watching a grown man stopping other adults from drinking? Is this fun? Am I having fun? Because they are not having fun. And I am, also, not having fun. So: no. No one\u2019s having fun.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to What's On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You might think that\u2019s because they need quiet to work, and should something of interest appear, they would turn the volume up. But that\u2019s not quite right. This brand of political professional believes that, when it comes to watching news coverage, the sound is all but irrelevant. What registers with people \u2013 with voters \u2013 are the pictures.\n\nDoes the leader look strong and in command? Or weak and hesitant? Is the candidate smiling, brimming with confidence? Or brooding, head in hands? Do they look natural, at ease with ordinary people \u2013 or gauche and awkward, a visiting alien from Planet Politician? For any of these judgments, you don\u2019t need to hear the words. The image alone tells the story.\n\nMany of the 33 pictures collected here do that for some of the best-known figures of recent British political history. Take the 1986 photograph of Margaret Thatcher in a tank. At the time, it was mocked aplenty. And you can see that, were someone else to try the same pose, or wear those same goggles, ridicule would be the first response. Indeed, when failed Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis attempted a similar stunt two years later, the resulting visual became an immediate TV ad \u2013 for his opponent. But for Thatcher it worked, making real what had, until then, been an imagining of the political cartoonists, casting Thatcher, she who had vanquished the Argentines in the Falklands war, as a latter-day Boudicca, a warrior queen, the Iron Lady.\n\nThe lasting images tend to work like that, crystallising, for good or ill, a view already loosely taking shape in the public \u2013 or at least the media\u2019s \u2013 mind. Boris Johnson on a zip wire: national court jester, a lovable fool not to be judged by the harsher standards applied to more conventional politicians (an exceptionalism that Johnson exploited all the way to, and once inside, Downing Street). Ian Paisley: Ulster\u2019s Dr No, the implacable naysayer and human incarnation of unionism\u2019s perennial cry of \u201cnever surrender\u201d. Nigel Farage: grinning John Bull and cavalier, ready to defy the nannying roundheads with their strictures against beer and fags. Theresa May and Ed Miliband: robot and geek, respectively, who, when attempting to do something spontaneous and recognisably human, such as dancing or eating a sandwich, seemed to struggle \u2013 sufficiently, in May\u2019s case, to make the viewer blush with embarrassment.\n\nSome photographs serve as wordless historical essays, silently explaining the causes, or anticipating the effects, of the epochal events of the last century\n\nEd\u2019s brother David was feted in the US as dashingly handsome \u2013 Vogue magazine confessed to a \u201ccrush\u201d on the then foreign secretary \u2013 but at home the snappers decided he was a nerd, the last kid to be picked for the football team. An image of him holding a banana distilled that suspicion. Never mind that he\u2019d merely complied with a request to hold up an item of fruit he had snatched for a breakfast-on-the-go at party conference: he could be cast as Mr Bean. Even if the camera never lies, it often fibs \u2013 serving to confirm a previously unarticulated, frequently unfair prejudice. And once it has, it sticks.\n\nAnd yet, the reason why many of the pictures collected here have such enduring power is that they capture not only the essence \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 of an individual, but an entire era. Need to evoke the optimism of mid-1960s Britain? Here\u2019s the Beatles alongside Harold Wilson, who together trigger that folk memory in a split second.\n\nMeanwhile, some photographs are capable of more than simply prompting a recollection: they serve as wordless historical essays, silently explaining the causes, or anticipating the effects, of the epochal events of the last century or more.\n\nNeville Chamberlain brandishing the Munich Agreement of 1938 \u2013 the infamous \u201cpiece of paper\u201d he had signed along with Adolf Hitler, supposedly promising peace between Britain and Nazi Germany \u2013 is perhaps the most freighted example. We see not just a politician, a microphone and a cheering crowd, but the naivete of a British prime minister bent on compromising with \u2013 appeasing \u2013 an enemy who we, endowed with all the hindsight of history, know to have been fatefully, and fatally, unappeasable. We see a British public, still drained by a global war that had ended just two decades earlier, jubilantly applauding a prime minister who had won a promise by which Britons and Germans would agree \u201cnever to go to war with one another again\u201d. We see the encouragement Munich, and its acquiescing in Hitler\u2019s seizure of a chunk of Czechoslovakia, would give to the dictator, encouraging him in his ambition to conquer all of Europe \u2013 and the lethal consequences that would bring. All in a single snapshot.\n\nNye Bevan and the nurses \u2013 and their boy patient \u2013 beam with the hope and promise of the new postwar National Health Service, though surely no one in that picture guessed they were present at the creation of an institution that, in 75 years, would rival the monarchy as a core component of the country\u2019s identity. A diminished Harold Macmillan, left hanging around waiting for Dwight Eisenhower, expresses neatly the changed geopolitical dynamic after the Suez crisis of 1956 that drove Anthony Eden from office, with the former empire now a supplicant, forced to defer to the new US superpower.\n\nMore recently, how eloquent is the picture of David Cameron and Nick Clegg during their rose garden love-in at Downing Street? Two men of similar age, class and education, full of excitement at the new coalition government they were launching \u2013 and already exhibiting the complacency that would prove to be the undoing of Cameron in particular. Just six years after the rose garden, Cameron would breezily inflict a referendum on the country that would do more damage to Britain\u2019s standing than Suez \u2013 more, in fact, than any decision since Munich.\n\nFor every debacle \u2013 the Ed Stone, anyone? \u2013 there is a Thatcher-as-Boudicca or even, more quietly, the Sunaks lighting Diwali candles in Downing Street\n\nThe folly of Brexit is caught in the morning-after picture from June 2016, where the furrowed brow of Michael Gove and the bowed head of Johnson could not hide their shock at their own victory. In an instant, they revealed that they had never seriously meant to win and were utterly unprepared for it. For Johnson, especially, the Brexit vote was only ever a move in a game, whose object was his own ascendancy in the Tory party and eventual installation in No 10. Suddenly, the pair understood that their jape had undone the work of a half century of cooperation and prosperity: Johnson was the guilty schoolboy, waiting for his punishment in the headteacher\u2019s study. Just for a fleeting interlude, but long enough to be caught by the camera, the architects of Vote Leave had the grace to look ashamed of what they had done. It would not last.\n\nSo potent are these images, so enduring, that to look on them is to realise why politicians and their handlers persist in staging them. The photo-op is derided, but no political adviser is ever going to give it up. For every debacle \u2013 the Ed Stone, anyone? \u2013 there is a Thatcher-as-Boudicca or even, more quietly, the Sunaks lighting Diwali candles in Downing Street. Whatever his failures in the job, Rishi Sunak has earned his place in history as the first Briton of colour to head the government \u2013 and this image tells that story. The contrast with his predecessors \u2013 the procession of (mostly) men, all white, (mostly) in suits and ties \u2013 or in Palmerston\u2019s case, frockcoat \u2013 is conveyed most swiftly in a picture.\n\nStill, I suspect that the favourites for a lot of Guardian readers will be those images that were never intended. The look on Michael Portillo\u2019s face that reveals the scale of the landslide defeat of 1997; Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s languid recline on the Commons benches that screams own-the-place entitlement; the defiance of Bernie Grant and Diane Abbott \u2013 sombre in him, delighted in her \u2013 back when the number of MPs of colour could be counted on one hand. These were snatched moments that live on.\n\nIn some cases, they live on in us. We remember where we were when these events happened, what we felt when these pictures were new. (Not for nothing was a book about the 1997 election called Were You Still Up for Portillo?). They tell so many stories \u2013 and they do it without making a sound.\n\n\n\nPicture captions by Gabrielle Schwarz, Naomi Larsson Pi\u00f1eda and Will Dean\n\nMargaret Thatcher in a tank\n\nJockel Finck, 1986\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Jockel Finck/AP\n\n\u201cCutting a dash somewhere between Lawrence of Arabia and Isadora Duncan,\u201d was how news presenter Jon Snow described Margaret Thatcher on a tank ride during a visit to the Nato training camp at Fallingbostel in West Germany in September 1986. The image of Thatcher riding in the Challenger, a flowing scarf tied around her hair, turned out to be a great PR move for the prime minister, whose popularity had been waning. When Liz Truss posed for photos in a tank during a visit to Estonia in 2021, some suggested the then foreign secretary was \u201cchannelling\u201d Thatcher. Gabrielle Schwarz\n\nNeville Chamberlain returns from Munich\n\nHulton-Deutsch/Getty Images, 1938\n\nWhen Nazi Germany threatened to invade Czechoslovakia in 1938, a major conflict among the European powers seemed inevitable. A relieved crowd cheered as prime minister Neville Chamberlain exited his plane at the Heston Aerodrome on 30 September, brandishing a \u201cnon-aggression\u201d pact co-signed with Adolf Hitler during crisis talks in Munich, where Britain, France and Italy had agreed to cede Czechoslovakia\u2019s Sudetenland to Germany. Hitler broke the Munich agreement when he occupied the rest of the country six months later; after he invaded Poland in September 1939, Chamberlain declared a state of war. The British prime minister \u2013 who was forced to step down in 1940 after a no-confidence vote reduced his majority \u2013 would for ever be associated with his previous policy of appeasement towards the Nazis, as emblematised by this photo. GS\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s slouch\n\nAFP/Getty Images, 2019\n\nThe battle over a no-deal Brexit was one of the most consequential in recent UK parliamentary history, but you wouldn\u2019t think it to look at this image of then leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg slouching on the bench during the emergency debate on 3 September 2019. With eyes barely open, his body language oozes boredom.\n\nIt was clear that crashing out of the trading bloc without a deal could have severe consequences for the economy, and Rees-Mogg\u2019s pose was criticised for embodying entitlement and arrogance; there were calls in the chamber for him to \u201csit up\u201d, while Green MP Caroline Lucas said, \u201chis body language throughout this evening has been so contemptuous of this house and of the people\u201d. He sat up straight only when the results of the vote came in: 21 Tory MPs had defied leader Boris Johnson by voting with the opposition to defeat the government, prompting Johnson to call for an early general election. Naomi Larsson Pi\u00f1eda\n\nNeil Kinnock\u2019s not \u2018all right\u2019\n\nBill Rowntree, 1992\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Bill Rowntree/Mirrorpix/Alamy\n\nIt seemed like a good idea in theory. Labour \u2013 seemingly on the brink of a first general election win since October 1974 \u2013 held a huge, US-style rally in Sheffield in April 1992, a week before election day. Party leader Kinnock arrived on stage to great fanfare before yelling \u201cWe\u2019re all right!\u201d three times, to great ridicule. The moment would come to haunt Kinnock \u2013 and define his surprise loss to John Major\u2019s Conservatives.\n\nThree years later in a television interview, he said it cost him the election: \u201cThis roar hit me, and for a couple of seconds I responded to it; and all of the years in which I\u2019d attempted to build a fairly reserved, starchy persona \u2013 in a few seconds they slipped away.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, US Democratic candidate Howard Dean, riding high on a wave of young online support would pay a sort of tribute to Kinnock by tanking his own presidential campaign with a very weird howl of defiance in Iowa \u2013 soon known, infamously, as \u201cthe Dean Scream\u201d. Will Dean\n\nChurchill: The Roaring Lion\n\nYousuf Karsh, 1941\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Yousuf Karsh/Camera Press\n\nThis portrait of Winston Churchill by Yousuf Karsh is said to be one of the most reproduced images in the history of photography \u2013 Britons will probably recognise it from the \u00a35 note. In one image, called The Roaring Lion, Karsh captured the essence of the person we understand Churchill to be: militant, determined, dangerously powerful.\n\nIt \u201ccaptures a moment in history\u201d, says Jerry Fielder, director of Karsh\u2019s estate. It was 30 December 1941; Britain was in the midst of war, and Churchill had just given a rousing speech at the Canadian parliament, where he retorted \u201csome chicken, some neck\u201d to Vichy France leader Marshal P\u00e9tain\u2019s threat that \u201cEngland will have her neck wrung like a chicken.\u201d\n\nThe photograph demonstrates Karsh\u2019s skills. The story goes that Churchill had not been informed that Karsh was there to take a picture of him. After finishing his speech \u2013 which you can see in the prime minister\u2019s pocket \u2013 Churchill entered the speaker\u2019s chamber, where Karsh had set up his lights and camera. He reluctantly assented to a photograph, with Karsh having to act quickly to capture the irate politician. \u201cHe had that sense of timing for the moment, and captured something truthful,\u201d Fielder says.\n\nKarsh later recalled that he struggled to photograph Churchill, whose face was obscured by smoke from his cigar. \u201cI stepped toward him and, without premeditation but ever so respectfully, I said, \u2018Forgive me, sir,\u2019 and plucked the cigar out of his mouth. By the time I got back to my camera, he looked so belligerent he could have devoured me. It was at that instant that I took the photograph.\u201d NLP\n\nTony Blair and George W Bush\n\nLuke Frazza, 2001\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Luke Frazza/EPA\n\nThe seeds of the special relationship between Tony Blair and George Bush were sown on their first meeting at Camp David in February 2001, just a month after the US president\u2019s inauguration. \u201cTony put the charm offensive on me and it worked,\u201d Bush told a press conference afterwards. Here, the two leaders are pictured smiling during a stroll with Bush\u2019s dog Spot. In 2010, the writer Blake Morrison deemed this image as his photograph of the decade. \u201c9/11, Iraq, Afghanistan: they\u2019re all prefigured in this shot,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe warning signs were all there, if only we\u2019d seen them.\u201d GS\n\nHarold Macmillan waits to greet Dwight Eisenhower\n\nJane Bown, 1959\n\nIn this photograph taken by the veteran Observer photographer Jane Bown, Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, waits to greet US president Dwight Eisenhower on his arrival in the UK as part of a European tour in 1959. Just three years beforehand, the then prime minister Anthony Eden\u2019s handling of the Suez crisis \u2013 which saw Britain, along with France and Israel, invade Egypt in an attempt to recover control of the Suez Canal \u2013 had severely damaged the US and UK\u2019s \u201cspecial relationship\u201d because Eisenhower had strongly opposed military action. Macmillan, who replaced Eden on his resignation, already had a rapport with Eisenhower since they had met in north Africa during the second world war, and spent his time as PM working to rebuild relations with the US. NLP\n\nThe Portillo moment\n\nKevin Lamarque, 1997\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nAt around 3am on 2 May 1997, Conservative MP Michael Portillo lost his seat in a shock result, dashing his hopes of becoming party leader and signalling a Labour landslide . The 1997 election ended 18 years of Tory rule, ushering in the decade of New Labour. This moment, captured by photographer Kevin Lamarque, has come to symbolise a sudden, unexpected shift in someone\u2019s political fortunes. As Portillo said himself: \u201cMy name is now synonymous with eating a bucketload of shit in public.\u201d NLP\n\nNancy Astor with Winston Churchill\n\nAlamy, 1941\n\nNancy Astor, the first female politician to take her seat in the House of Commons, had a fractious relationship with Winston Churchill. \u201cIf I were married to you, I would put poison in your coffee,\u201d she is often quoted as saying to him. \u201cIf I were married to you, I\u2019d drink it,\u201d he apparently replied. (The veracity of the exchange is disputed.) But during this visit to Plymouth to inspect damage after heavy bombing in the city, the prime minister and the Conservative MP for Plymouth Sutton \u2013 in the black hat \u2013 put their differences aside. GS\n\nNorman Tebbit after the Brighton hotel bombing\n\nAP, 1984\n\nIn the early hours of 12 October 1984, IRA member Patrick Magee detonated a bomb at the Grand hotel in Brighton, which was hosting the Conservative party conference. The intended target, prime minister Margaret Thatcher, survived, but five other people were killed and dozens injured. One of those injured was the then trade secretary Norman Tebbit, pictured here being stretchered out of the rubble. Tebbit\u2019s wife, Margaret, was left paralysed by the attack. The politician \u2013 an uncompromising rightwinger known for his staunch anti-immigrant views and notorious \u201ccricket test\u201d of loyalty to the country \u2013 had been tipped as Thatcher\u2019s successor, but he resigned from the cabinet after the 1987 election so he could care for his wife. He entered the Lords in 1992, where he was a critic of the party\u2019s shift to the centre ground under David Cameron; he retired from the house in March 2022. NLP\n\nLabour party Black Sections\n\nPA, 1988\n\nIn this photo from the 1988 Labour party conference, during a debate around Black representation in the party, MPs Bernie Grant and Diane Abbott stand with their arms raised, while Paul Boateng and Keith Vaz sit behind them. \u201c[We] are literally and metaphorically standing for something,\u201d says Abbott. \u201cTaking a stand, as much as it annoys the leadership and upsets the status quo, also has the capacity to inspire others.\u201d\n\nIn the 80s, these trailblazing politicians and others, frustrated by the lack of progress within Labour, led campaigns for racial justice. There was at the time little support for minority politicians; in 1983, for example, only one Black Labour parliamentary candidate had been selected, and that was for a safe Tory seat. By 1987, there were four Black MPs leading the fight against discrimination in the party and wider politics.\n\nBoateng recalls that he, Abbott, Grant and Vaz would sit together \u201cto highlight a unity of purpose\u201d. \u201cWe had agreed beforehand to stand up in twos so the party managers were forced to call us to make the same point at least twice. Black representation and racial justice were works in progress,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were not going to be silenced.\u201d\n\nAbbott adds: \u201cThe fight then was over Black self-representation in the Labour party. We were vilified for attempting to create Black Sections within the party, but they were necessary to address the party\u2019s abysmal record on racism and other issues.\u201d Abbott argues that Labour has \u201cgone backwards\u201d under its current leadership, pointing to the 2022 Forde report that revealed a \u201chierarchy of racism\u201d within the party. She says: \u201cWe continue to take a stand.\u201d NLP\n\nJohn Prescott\u2019s punch\n\nShutterstock, 2001\n\nA few hours after the Labour party launched their manifesto in May 2001, John Prescott was on the campaign trail in Rhyl in north Wales, when a protester threw an egg at him. The deputy PM immediately socked him with a left hook.\n\nThe moment has followed Prescott throughout his career. \u201cPeople won\u2019t remember me for my 40 years in parliament,\u201d he told the Radio Times in 2017. \u201cInstead, I\u2019ll be remembered for 40 seconds of my life: the time I thumped that bloke in the street.\u201d The punch became a symbol of his sometimes volatile personality \u2013 \u201cJohn is John,\u201d Tony Blair said in the press conference the morning after. Although the next few hours were filled with panic for the governing party, who feared it could sink Prescott\u2019s career and even the election, there was no lasting damage. Labour went on to win handsomely. NLP\n\nKeir Hardie at a peace rally\n\nHulton-Deutsch/Getty Images, 1914\n\nIn August 1914, two days before war was declared, Keir Hardie spoke at a peace rally in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square, issuing a statement that read: \u201cThere is no time to lose. Down with the rule of brute force! Down with war! Up with the peaceful rule of the people!\u201d Born in Scotland, Hardie began his career in politics by establishing a union at his colliery and leading the first ever strike of Lanarkshire miners \u2013 he had been working in coalmines since the age of 10. Hardie later became a founder of the Labour party and one of the first two Labour parliamentarians (the other was Richard Bell). He vehemently opposed war, supporting conscientious objectors, and died in 1915 while attempting to organise a pacifist general strike. NLP\n\nBoris Johnson and Michael Gove\n\nStefan Rousseau, 2016\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt was the morning after the Brexit referendum. Vote Leave was unexpectedly victorious \u2013 the mood of the campaign group\u2019s press conference should have been jubilant. But when Boris Johnson and Michael Gove appeared at the podium, they struck an undeniably sombre tone. In this image, the two politicians are captured with their eyes cast down and their brows furrowed. The photographer, Stefan Rousseau, remembers the moment clearly: \u201cThey just looked like they were thinking, \u2018What have we done?\u2019 There was that strong slogan \u2013 Take Back Control \u2013 and yet they both looked like they\u2019d lost control.\u201d GS\n\nRishi Sunak rings in Diwali\n\nToby Melville, 2023\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters\n\nThere is plenty that is unprogressive about Rishi Sunak, from his controversial migration policies to his apparent lack of interest in fighting climate breakdown. But the appointment of the first prime minister of colour in the UK \u2013 and also the first Hindu at No 10 \u2013 was nonetheless a landmark moment. In this photo from November last year, Sunak and his family are seen lighting diyas outside the prime minister\u2019s residence on Downing Street to mark the first day of Diwali. Three years earlier, the then-chancellor lit the Diwali lamps alone outside No 11. However, many would argue that the staged photo of the extremely wealthy Sunak filling up a Kia Rio at a Sainsbury\u2019s petrol station \u2013 which went viral for the wrong reasons when it was revealed he had borrowed the car from a supermarket worker \u2013 is perhaps the truer defining image of Britain\u2019s richest PM. GS\n\nShirley Williams campaigns for the SDP\n\nAlamy, 1983\n\nIn the lead-up to the general election of 1983, the Social Democratic party \u2013 formed two years earlier by ex-members of Labour unhappy with the party\u2019s movement to the left \u2013 briefly looked like it stood a chance of breaking through. Shirley Williams, who became the SDP\u2019s first elected MP after winning the 1981 Crosby byelection, is pictured on the campaign trail, carried by broadcaster Steve Race (left) and comedy legend Barry Cryer (right), and supported by (from left) actors Simon Cadell, Robert Powell, Denis Quilley and Richard Attenborough, and presenter Bamber Gascoigne. Though Williams \u2013 the second child of the political scientist George Catlin and the pacifist author Vera Brittain \u2013 lost her seat, she was still widely liked by the public and her peers, and was nicknamed \u201cShirl the Pearl\u201d for her popularity. She remained active in politics until her retirement in 2016, notably serving as leader of the Liberal Democrats \u2013 which were formed after a merger of the SDP and the Liberal party \u2013 in the House of Lords from 2001 to 2004. GS\n\nEd Miliband\u2019s cursed bacon sandwich\n\nJeremy Selwyn, 2014\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Jeremy Selwyn/Evening Standard/Getty Images\n\nFor Ed Miliband, 21 May 2014 should have been like any other day of campaigning. But on a visit to London\u2019s New Covent Garden market \u2013 where he was photographed buying flowers for his wife \u2013 he got hungry and made a fateful decision: he ate a bacon sandwich.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t realise how hot it was,\u201d says Jeremy Selwyn, who captured the first bite. \u201cObviously he really struggled with it because it was baking hot. As a photographer, you can\u2019t ignore images like that \u2013 although I didn\u2019t realise at the time what a huge impact it would have.\u201d\n\nThe image appeared on the front page of the Sun and in countless memes. Though it is undeniably a funny photo \u2013 as is any unflattering picture of someone eating \u2013 it made Miliband a target for the rightwing press, which seized on it as a symbol of the politician\u2019s supposed incompetence: if he couldn\u2019t eat a bacon sandwich, how could he run a country? \u201cA lot of people said it did in his political career,\u201d says Selwyn. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it did \u2013 he was struggling as a politician at that stage. I don\u2019t have any worries about what I\u2019ve done \u2013 as photographers, we just record what is happening in front of us.\u201d\n\nDavid Miliband\u2019s banana\n\nFelipe Trueba, 2008\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Felipe Trueba/UPPA/Photoshot\n\nEd\u2019s brother David had his breakfast choices used against him a few years earlier. In 2008, the then foreign secretary was photographed holding a banana as he walked to the Labour conference. Felipe Trueba recalls the moment: \u201cMiliband arrived with a banana in his hand, not thinking much about it.\u201d When he realised the press were pointing at it: \u201cHe displayed it to everyone and had a laugh about the fact that they were paying so much attention to such a trivial thing \u2026 and everything went out of control.\u201d The photo was widely mocked. Later that year, the Conservative party conference served \u201cDavid Miliband bananas\u201d stickered with an image of the politician; and in 2010 Channel 4 reported that his aides still bore the psychological scars of \u201cbanana-gate\u201d. \u201cWas Miliband, a hardened politician, too naive?\u201d says Trueba. \u201cMaybe. But certainly he did not deserve \u2018banana-gate\u2019.\u201d NLP\n\nHarold Wilson and the Beatles\n\nKent Gavin, 1964\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Kent Gavin/Getty Images\n\nIn this image, taken on 19 March 1964, a smiling Harold Wilson stands beside the Beatles. At first glance, the photo signals a new Britain, free from the stuffiness of the 1950s. The Beatles were already global stars, representing a new youth culture, and just over six months later, Wilson would be leading a Labour government that pushed through liberalising social reforms.\n\n\u201cThe zeitgeist seems to be going their way,\u201d says David Kynaston, historian and author of A Northern Wind. \u201cWilson is a reaction against the Old Etonian prime ministers. He\u2019s a Yorkshireman who was state educated and really understands economics and the modern world \u2013 that\u2019s the impression he gives.\u201d\n\nWhile the pull of modernity looks \u201cirresistible\u201d in this photo, says Kynaston, the truth is actually more complicated. \u201cWe tend to exaggerate the pace of change in the 60s. There was change happening in society, and clearly in politics \u2013 after all, Labour did win the election \u2013 but these winds weren\u2019t quite as rapid as one assumes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was still a society with constant tension between modernity and people being resistant to modernity.\u201d When this photograph was taken, he says, there was extreme racial prejudice in society, abortion and homosexuality were illegal, and capital punishment was still in force. \u201cLike many photographs, it tells the truth, but not necessarily the whole truth.\u201d NLP\n\nKwarteng blows it\n\nOli Scarff, 2022\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter the chaos of the Boris Johnson years, the UK was preparing for a period of relative calm with the appointment of Liz Truss as prime minister in September 2022.\n\nThen the Queen died. And as soon as normal business resumed, Kwasi Kwarteng \u2013 a new Tory star and the first Black chancellor \u2013 dropped his mini budget entitled \u201cthe growth plan\u201d in the House of Commons. The \u00a345bn tax-cutting package \u2013 which included huge tax cuts for the highest paid and the abolition of a cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses \u2013 crashed the pound, spooked borrowers and triggered an emergency Bank of England \u00a365bn bond-buying programme.\n\nAs the budget exploded on impact with reality \u2013 \u201ca little turbulence\u201d he called it \u2013 Kwarteng began to U-turn, before heading to the Conservative party conference. Here, Oli Scarff of Agence France-Press captured him mid-interview as he struggled to regain the narrative.\n\nThe fallout of the mini-budget would torpedo Kwarteng\u2019s career, make Truss the shortest-serving prime minister in history \u2013 and leave ordinary Britons staring at their mortgage statements in despair. WD\n\nOxford University\u2019s Bullingdon Club\n\nPainted by Rona Marsden from a 1987 photograph\n\nThis image would come to represent the elitism at the highest levels of British politics. The Bullingdon Club is a male-only Oxford University student drinking club associated with sexism, wild antics and destructive behaviour \u2013 people close to it have recalled stories of members soliciting sex workers to perform at the club\u2019s dinners, and vandalising restaurants and student accommodation. Since it was founded more than 200 years ago, it has counted in its ranks numerous future members of the British establishment.\n\nIn this image of the 1987 cohort in the club\u2019s infamous tailcoat uniform, future Conservative prime minister David Cameron stands second left, while Boris Johnson sits bottom right. George Osborne \u2013 who was in a 1992 photograph of the club \u2013 would go on to become chancellor in Cameron\u2019s government. When Osborne and Cameron pursued their policy of austerity, the resurfaced photos raised questions about inequality.\n\nThe \u201cclass of 87\u201d picture became so notorious that permission to republish the photograph was withdrawn by the copyright holders. To get around that, journalist Michael Crick commissioned artist Rona Marsden to paint a copy. \u201cI thought the image was a stirring representation of an elitist club \u2013 a timeless image in many ways,\u201d says Marsden. \u201cOf course I was aware of who was in the photograph and didn\u2019t think that it was fair that someone was trying to hide it.\u201d NLP\n\nNigel Farage with a pint\n\nGareth Fuller, 2015\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA\n\nThe image of Nigel Farage at the pub with a beer was central to the formation of his brand identity. When on the campaign trail for Ukip before the 2015 general election, the self-styled \u201cman of the people\u201d regularly mugged for the cameras while brandishing a pint of bitter (never lager). Here he is pictured with a pint at the Northwood Club in the seaside town of Ramsgate, in the seat of South Thanet where he was standing to be the MP. \u201cA member of staff at the pub realised it was St George\u2019s Day and gave Nigel the apron [with the flag of St George] to wear,\u201d recalls photographer Gareth Fuller. \u201cHe\u2019s always great for a picture, so he put it on, held his pint, and we snapped away. I think the image of Nigel having a pint and a chat in a pub isn\u2019t a bad one,\u201d says Fuller. \u201cIt seems a natural thing for him to do and suggests he is approachable to all sorts of people.\u201d\n\nFarage might not have won his bid for South Thanet in 2015, but he was so popular with the Ukip membership that, days after the election, the party rejected his resignation as leader. But how authentic is the salt-of-the-earth image of Farage, an ex-commodities trader? In 2019, a waggish tabloid story claimed that he actually preferred red wine, and drinks beer just \u201cto be seen with it\u201d. GS\n\nBevan and the birth of the NHS\n\nTrafford Healthcare NHS, 1948\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Trafford Healthcare NHS/PA\n\nThis photograph captures the birth of the National Health Service on 5 July 1948. Here, Aneurin Bevan, the health minister who fought hard to get his plan for free healthcare past Clement Attlee\u2019s postwar Labour cabinet, is pictured on the day of its inauguration. Bevan stands beside a patient and nurse in Park hospital in Davyhulme, Manchester \u2013 the first NHS hospital. More than 75 years later, the NHS still holds to its founding principle: that healthcare should be free at the point of use. NLP\n\nBoris Johnson on a wire\n\nKois Miah, 2012\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Kois Miah/Getty Images\n\nThe bumbling buffoon, the court jester, the clown king: these are just some of the unflattering epithets assigned to Boris Johnson over his political career. Yet it is also often pointed out that Johnson knows exactly what he is doing by playing the fool \u2013 that it has all been a carefully calibrated act. How else to explain his participation in such silly capers as a zip wire trip at an event to celebrate the 2012 Olympic Games in London?\n\nWhen the zip wire malfunctioned, the then mayor of London was famously left dangling in his harness while holding a pair of union jacks for around 10 minutes. After an onlooker posted a snap to Twitter, the photographer Kois Miah was dispatched to Victoria Park in east London to find out what was going on. \u201cIf the editors hadn\u2019t sent me there on my bike,\u201d Miah recalls, \u201cthe episode may never have been published so widely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s media was focused on the actual Olympics, so it was really surprising to see the photo from a fringe event in almost all the nationals the next day \u2013 and even more crazy that it\u2019s still remembered and referenced 12 years after the event,\u201d says Miah. The image of Johnson flailing in the air after attempting a pointless stunt seems to be a resonant metaphor. Another strange layer to the story: park goers there at the time have said it was well known the zip wire wasn\u2019t working, and speculated that Johnson staged the whole thing. GS\n\nLord Palmerston\n\nHerbert Watkins, 1857\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Herbert Watkins/Pictorial Press/Alamy\n\nLord Palmerston, who became Britain\u2019s oldest prime minister when he took up the post at 70 (and would later become the first PM for the newly formed Liberal party) is pictured in what is believed to be one of the earliest photographs of a sitting British prime minister. The 1857 photograph by Herbert Watkins began the tradition of official ministerial portraits that continues to this day. \u201cMost human beings, few more so than prime ministers, are vain,\u201d says historian Anthony Seldon. He argues the portraits \u201ctell much about how the individual wants to portray themselves, but rather less about what the individual is really like underneath it all\u201d. Alison Smith, chief curator at the National Portrait Gallery, which houses a collection of Watkins\u2019 work, says official portraits \u201cinevitably conform to a type that conveys decorum and begs our trust\u201d. NLP\n\nTheresa May does the Maybot\n\nOli Scarff, 2018\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDuring her premiership, Theresa May acquired a reputation \u2013 less from her policies, but rather her manner \u2013 as the cringiest of prime ministers. Her most awkward and embarrassing moments frequently became internet memes: here she is pictured bopping on to the stage at the 2018 Conservative party conference to the strains of Abba\u2019s Dancing Queen (apparently one of her favourite songs). Was this a self-deprecating reference to two widely mocked dancing attempts during a trade trip across Africa earlier that summer? Whatever the logic, the \u201cMaybot\u2019s\u201d stilted moves at the Tory conference did nothing to counteract her unfortunate reputation. GS\n\nTobias Ellwood and PC Keith Palmer\n\nStefan Rousseau, 2017\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA\n\nTobias Ellwood, then a junior foreign minister, was on his way to parliament on the afternoon of 22 March 2017 when he came across the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack outside the Palace of Westminster. The Conservative MP for Bournemouth East, a medically trained former soldier, rushed to help. He attempted to perform resuscitation on PC Keith Palmer, who had been stabbed by the attacker. Despite the efforts of Ellwood and others, Palmer died from his injuries \u2013 he was one of five people killed in the attack.\n\nThere might never have been a visual record of these events if Stefan Rousseau, chief political photographer of the Press Association, had not been at the organisation\u2019s offices in parliament that day. \u201cI\u2019m out and about a lot,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I just happened to be there.\u201d After hearing the gunshots, Rousseau found his way to a bathroom window, where he remained for 40 minutes taking photographs. He ignored calls from his picture editor so he wouldn\u2019t have to put his camera down.\n\nThe harrowing images show blood spattered on Ellwood\u2019s forehead as he attended to Palmer, surrounded by a group of medics and officers. \u201cWhen people saw the pictures, he became a hero of the moment,\u201d Rousseau recalls. Politicians on all sides hailed Ellwood for his bravery, and the Queen appointed him to the privy council in recognition of his role in attempting to save Palmer\u2019s life. GS\n\nGordon Brown\u2019s triumph \u2013 in hindsight\n\nMartin Argles, 2009\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Martin Argles/The Guardian\n\nIn the summer of 2009, Brown, who had finally replaced his great rival and ally Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street in 2007, was having a torrid time. He had been battered by the biggest financial crisis in generations, dismal local election results, party in-fighting that nearly toppled his leadership, and a public image so bad that an article in the Guardian headlined \u201cWhere did it all go wrong for Gordon Brown?\u201d said \u201cBrown is a prime minister so beleaguered, so unpopular and seemingly exhausted, so apparently luckless and unsuited to the job, that he attracts general ridicule and even pity.\u201d\n\nBut, just a few months earlier, Brown had played perhaps the pivotal role in preventing the global banking system collapsing over one frantic, terrifying October 2008 weekend. Fast-forward to April 2009, and Brown led a G20 summit in London in which leaders of the world\u2019s biggest economies agreed deals to further stabilise the economy \u2013 though there would later be global protests against the way governments had propped up the banks at taxpayers\u2019 expense. Brown was soon out of office \u2013 bigotgate and all that \u2013 but his trashed reputation in the short term has been replaced in the history books by the images of him centre-stage in London with Obama, Sarkozy et al, breathing a mighty sigh of relief. WD\n\nEnoch Powell\n\nPopperfoto/Getty Images, 1970\n\nThis photograph of Conservative MP Enoch Powell speaking in Birmingham in 1970 was taken two years after his notorious \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech, but conveys the politician\u2019s controversial fiery oratory. Speaking at a meeting of Conservative activists in April 1968, Powell had criticised the proposed Race Relations Act, which would make it illegal to refuse employment, housing or public services to someone based on their race and ethnicity. He had warned that immigration to Britain from former colonies would lead to violent clashes: \u201cAs I look ahead I am filled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see \u2018the River Tiber foaming with much blood\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe speech instantly became one of the most divisive in British history. Powell\u2019s views were widely denounced and blamed for inspiring violent attacks on minority communities, but others took to the streets in support of Powell\u2019s calls to repatriate immigrants. It also pushed one Wolverhampton primary school to the centre of the debate \u2013 in the speech, Powell had claimed that a constituent had told him their child was the only white student in the class, which created a media frenzy. West Park school has since used Powell\u2019s legacy to teach diversity and integration. NLP\n\nPaisley on the stump\n\nPeter Kemp, 1982\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Peter Kemp/AP\n\nIan Paisley\u2019s dramatic, and welcome, decision in 2007 to enter into a power-sharing agreement with Martin McGuinness and Sinn F\u00e9in might have marked the surprising denouement of his unlikely political odyssey, but it\u2019s images like this of the Democratic Unionist party founder \u2013 wild-eyed, furious and spouting hellfire \u2013 that defined how many will remember his turbulent career. Paisley \u2013 nicknamed Dr No \u2013 was unbending, difficult and obdurate: he once said the naming of a new Belfast bridge after Queen Elizabeth II rather than unionist hero Edward Carson was \u201ca sop to the Catholics\u201d. On his death in 2014, tributes came from across Northern Ireland\u2019s political divide \u2013 but for many Paisley will be for ever tainted by his decades of rabble-rousing and overt bigotry. WD\n\nThe Liz Truss lettuce\n\nDaily Star, 2022\n\nIn 2022, the UK had three different prime ministers in the space of two months. There is perhaps no better image that reflects this disastrous and embarrassing era of British politics than the lettuce that outlasted Liz Truss\u2019s premiership. In October, the Daily Star set up a webcam to livestream an iceberg lettuce, dressed up with a blond wig and creepy smile, to see whether it or Truss would have a longer shelf life. After a tumultuous 45 days as PM, in which \u201cTrussonomics\u201d caused the pound to drop to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, Truss announced her resignation, and it was the lettuce that triumphed, strong and unwilting. NLP\n\nBarbara Castle fights for equal pay\n\nDave Bagnall Collection, 1954\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Dave Bagnall Collection/Alamy\n\nWith her auburn hair and socialist leanings, Barbara Castle was dubbed the \u201cred queen\u201d of the Labour party. Among the notable achievements of her long career \u2013 she served as Blackburn\u2019s MP for more than three decades \u2013 was the Equal Pay Act of 1970, which prohibited pay-based discrimination between men and women. Castle had been campaigning on the issue for many years. This photo from 1954 shows her (second from the right) in a cross-party group of female MPs delivering a petition calling for \u201cequal pay for equal work\u201d to the House of Commons.

Journalists had been expecting to see little more than a brisk handshake outside No 10. Instead, the new prime minister and his deputy stood side by side in the idyllic setting of the Downing Street rose garden, seeking to project an image of unity and happiness following a bitterly fought election campaign.

It called on ministers to urgently inject \u00a34bn into town hall budgets.\n\nFour councils have gone bust in the past year while others said that only with drastic cuts can they avoid imminent insolvency in the face of soaring social care, homelessness and special educational needs costs. Charities fear community grants are seen as a priority for cuts as town halls retreat to \u201cbare legal minimum\u201d levels of service.\n\nEmerging cuts to charities include:\n\nThe closure of Mansfield Citizens Advice after Mansfield district council cut its \u00a355,000 core costs grant. Based in one of England\u2019s most deprived areas, the charity helped 2,400 people last year with debt, housing and poverty issues. Citizens Advice Woking, in Surrey, also faces closure after bankrupt Woking borough council cancelled its \u00a3180,000 grant.\n\nCommunity First bus services linking communities in rural Hampshire are under threat after Hampshire county council, which faces a \u00a3132m deficit over the next two years, cut funding by \u00a3500,000. It has also scrapped a \u00a3500,000 grant that funds volunteer support and legal backup for more than 650 local grassroots charities.\n\nNeighbourhood charities in Birmingham have warned that thousands of children are at risk as a result of proposals by the bankrupt city council to cut an \u00a38m early help contract providing safety net services to thousands of families struggling with poverty, mental illness and addiction.\n\nDame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cAs our advisers see increased numbers of people in dire situations, unable to afford basics like housing, energy and food, our work has never been more important. But our ability to make a difference in communities depends on funding.\n\n\u201cLocal government has been a crucial funder for charities like Citizens Advice, so the current crisis is deeply troubling. We\u2019ll continue working to make sure we can be there for as many people as possible.

That was as much as the local district council said it could scrape together, but it was still a 50% cut in core grant funding and ultimately not enough to prevent Mansfield Citizens Advice service from becoming a casualty of the financial crisis raging through England\u2019s local authorities.\n\nJust over a week ago, when it became clear there was no more room for manoeuvre, the charity\u2019s board of trustees took the decision to close for good, after 41 years serving the Nottinghamshire ex-mining town, one of the UK\u2019s most deprived areas. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating,\u201d said its chair, Carmel Reilly. \u201cThere\u2019s no other place for clients to go.\u201d\n\nMansfield Citizens Advice\u2019s prime task has been fighting poverty, its staff and volunteers providing practical help to a local community struggling with soaring debt, eviction and poverty. It was clear about its social justice mission: \u201cPeople need someone on their side, who will do battle for them,\u201d said Reilly.\n\nLast year it provided expert financial advice to nearly 2,500 local people, helping them manage debts, apply for social security benefits, and resolve rent arrears. Times have been hard in recent years \u2013 industrial decline followed by austerity, pandemic and a cost of living crisis \u2013 and demand for its services have been off the scale.\n\nDespite just a handful of staff and a budget of just \u00a3300,000, its return on investment was impressive last year: advisers got \u00a3800,000 of clients\u2019 personal debts \u2013 on average \u00a37,700 per person \u2013 written off. More than \u00a31.1m in benefit entitlements was secured. By stopping tenants being evicted, it estimates it saved local landlords \u00a3268,000.\n\nIts work had the additional benefit of shoring up people\u2019s wellbeing, as well as their bank accounts, and preventing costly state interventions later on, said Reilly. The loss of the service, she reckons, will result in higher rates of stress and mental illness, and greater need at the GP surgery and the council\u2019s homelessness department.\n\nMansfield district council\u2019s grant to Citizens Advice was \u00a355,000 \u2013 a so-called core costs payment that enabled the charity to pay staff and overheads. That base funding in turn allowed it to pull in project grants of about \u00a3250,000, a fragile economy of social investment that now looks about to collapse.\n\nThe council is struggling with a \u00a35.4m deficit over the next three years. The local councillor Craig Whitby said the decision to cut funding was difficult, but made with the \u201cutmost care and consideration\u201d. An unsuccessful 11th hour attempt was made to scramble together a solution using cash earmarked for councillors\u2019 allowances. Ultimately, he added, it was \u201cessential for the financial health and stability of our council\u201d.\n\nCitizens Advice nationally estimates that local authorities collectively provide a third of its local branches\u2019 funding. The risk is that these grants will be viewed as \u201cdiscretionary\u201d \u2013 and therefore expendable \u2013 by stricken councils seeking options to cut back to \u201cbasic minimum\u201d levels of service. The current funding crisis was \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d, said Citizens Advice\u2019s chief executive, Dame Clare Moriarty.\n\nIn the leafy Surrey commuter town of Woking, the socio-demographic profile is very different to Mansfield, but its local Citizens Advice service too faces the prospect of closure from April after Woking borough council embarked on a drastic cuts programme, announced that it was scrapping its \u00a3180,000-a-year core costs grant.\n\nIts chair, Laurence Oates, told the Guardian it helped 6,725 clients last year, providing help with universal credit and disability benefits, housing, family advice, and referrals to other local charities such as food banks. It estimates that every \u00a31 invested in Woking Citizens Advice in 2022-23 saved the NHS and other public services \u00a36, amounting to over \u00a32m.\n\nWoking council\u2019s well-publicised bankruptcy last year, with debts of over \u00a31bn, means it can no longer afford to invest in services it has no legal obligation to provide \u2013 even a vital community charity like Citizens Advice that saves it money in the long run and is at core of the local voluntary ecosystem.\n\n\u201cOur role is to protect vulnerable citizens in Woking \u2013 we are a lifeline,\u201d said Oates. \u201cFor the people we serve, there will be a lot of unmet need, and we can\u2019t see how that gap will be filled.\u201d"}

Other organisations such as the charity Turn2us say benefits such as the personal independence payment are also overlooked.\n\nThen there are tax perks you may be entitled to, prizes you never claimed, and cash in accounts that may have gone astray. So what money may have your name on it?\n\nUnclaimed premium bond prizes\n\nA total of \u00a381m in premium bond prizes is waiting to be collected.\n\nThe 2,358,553 unclaimed prizes include six \u00a3100,000 wins, one of which is registered to a bondholder with an Australian address, says the website Savings Champion.\n\nThey include what could well be the UK\u2019s oldest unclaimed prizes: some \u00a325 wins dating back to 1957.\n\nA prize that remains uncashed for 18 months is classed as unclaimed. There is no time limit for claiming a premium bond win \u2013 each prize is held until the rightful owner can be tracked down.\n\nSome of these winners may be dead, though. If someone has died, the prize would go to their estate.\n\nView image in fullscreen There is \u00a381m in premium bond prizes waiting to be collected. Photograph: Mark Richardson/Alamy\n\nIn many cases the unclaimed prizes have been left sitting in National Savings and Investments (NS&I)\u2019s system because the winners have moved house and failed to provide their new address. Some people may have forgotten they even had premium bonds.\n\nYou can easily check if you have an unclaimed win by using NS&I\u2019s online prize checker or its prize checker app. You will need to know your numbers \u2013 they will be on any letter you have about your account.\n\nTo trace any lost bonds that you do not have numbers for, you will need to contact NS&I. It has a tracing service you can use. Once you are reunited with your holdings, you can set up to receive prizes directly into your bank account.\n\nLost savings accounts\n\nThere are more than 150m bank and building society accounts in the UK, and inevitably, some end up getting lost and becoming dormant. This is where an account has been inactive for a long time \u2013 often 15 years \u2013 and the bank, building society or NS&I writes to the customer but no response is received.\n\nLuckily, there is a free service called My Lost Account \u2013 at mylostaccount.org.uk \u2013 that can help you trace this money. It brings together the tracing schemes of the banking body UK Finance, the Building Societies Association and NS&I into a single website, so you only need to fill in one application form.\n\nThe service is aimed at people who are unsure which institution holds their account \u2013 including instances where the bank or building society may have closed or merged with another. Information provided via the online application form is passed to the institutions that may be holding the lost account. They will then carry out a search of their lost accounts.\n\nIf you know the name of the bank or building society with which you held the account, and that institution still exists, then it\u2019s best to start by contacting them directly.\n\nView image in fullscreen There are more than 150m bank and building society accounts in the UK. Photograph: Stephen Barnes/Finance/Alamy\n\nThe marriage allowance\n\nThis is an often-overlooked tax break that applies to couples where one earns less than the personal allowance \u2013 normally \u00a312,570.\n\nThe lower earner can transfer up to \u00a31,260 of their personal allowance to their husband, wife or civil partner who is earning more than that and therefore paying tax. It only applies if the higher earner is not a higher-rate taxpayer. The transfer reduces the recipient\u2019s tax by up to \u00a3252 a year currently. This is typically done by changing their tax code.\n\nThe person with the lower income can apply online. It\u2019s free, and they will get an email confirming their application within 24 hours. They can also do it via the self-assessment system (assuming they are already registered and send in a tax return) or by filling in the form MATCF and sending it to the address on the form.\n\nIndividuals can backdate their claim to include any tax year since 5 April 2019 that they were eligible. Their partner\u2019s tax bill will be reduced depending on the personal allowance rate for the relevant years.\n\nView image in fullscreen The marriage allowance applies to couples where one earns less than the personal allowance \u2013 normally \u00a312,570. Photograph: isitsharp/Getty Images\n\nChild trust fund cash\n\nChild trust funds (CTFs) \u2013 dubbed \u201cbaby bonds\u201d \u2013 were a big deal: more than 6.3m were opened between their launch in 2005 and 2011 when they were scrapped, and billions of pounds are locked up in them. But a lot of these accounts have been forgotten about, which means that for many young people, there is a pot of cash out there that they are unaware of.\n\nWhen children turn 18, they can access their money. The first payouts were made in 2020, and the windfalls will run all the way through until January 2029.\n\nIf a child\u2019s parents or guardian failed to open a CTF account within a year, HM Revenue and Customs opened one on their behalf. At least 1.7m \u201cRevenue-allocated\u201d accounts were opened. On top of that, some parents will have forgotten about their child\u2019s fund and maybe moved house.\n\nLast year MPs were told there may be more than 900,000 unclaimed CTFs with in excess of \u00a31.7bn in them.\n\nThe Share Foundation, a charity, has been working with the government to help young people find their accounts, and runs a free-to-use search service. Go to findctf.sharefound.org and you will find a simple form you can fill in.\n\nHMRC has also created an online tool to help young people find out where their account is held.\n\nAttendance allowance\n\nThe name of this benefit probably doesn\u2019t help take-up \u2013 it\u2019s not clear at first glance who or what it is for. In a nutshell, it is money to help you pay for care if you have reached state pension age and you have an illness or disability that means you need that support. An award of attendance allowance can be worth up to \u00a35,306 a year.\n\nIn December, a report by the company Policy in Practice and MoneySavingExpert.com claimed that 1.1 million pension-age households could be missing out on \u00a35.2bn of attendance allowance each year.\n\nTo qualify, you must have needed help or supervision for at least six months \u2013 unless you are terminally ill, in which case you do not have to wait.\n\nIt is not means-tested, it doesn\u2019t matter if you live alone or with other people and no one checks what you spend it on. It is also tax-free. You can still get it if you live in a care home and pay the home costs yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s paid weekly, and there are two rates: one if you need help during either the daytime or at night, and one if you need help in both. These rates are currently \u00a368.10 and \u00a3101.75 respectively.\n\nYou can claim by printing off and filling in a form, or phone the dedicated helpline (0800 731 0122) to request a copy. Citizens Advice says it is best to phone because your payments will be backdated to the date you phoned.\n\nYou may have to undergo an assessment to check your eligibility if it\u2019s unclear how your illness or disability affects you.\n\nChild benefit\n\nThe high income child benefit charge \u2013 a tax penalty that hits parents earning more than \u00a350,000 a year \u2013 has been around for more than 10 years now.\n\nAs of August 2022, more than 680,000 families with one or more higher earners had opted out of receiving child benefit in order to avoid being hit by the charge.\n\nView image in fullscreen The high income child benefit charge hits parents earning more than \u00a350,000 a year. Photograph: Brian Jackson/Alamy\n\nHowever, some of those affected will have subsequently lost their job, reduced their hours or taken a pay cut, and as a result are no longer earning \u00a350,000-plus.\n\nIf you have previously opted out but now earn less, make sure you restart your child benefit payments (assuming you still qualify).\n\nChild benefit is worth \u00a324 a week \u2013 or \u00a31,248 a year \u2013 for the oldest or only child. The rate for each additional child is \u00a315.90 a week, or almost \u00a3827 a year.\n\nView image in fullscreen A council tax bill. Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA\n\nYou can reapply by filling in an online form (you need a Government Gateway user ID and password), or by contacting the child benefit office. You can do this online, by phone (0300 200 3100) or by post.\n\nIncidentally, new parents can now claim child benefit online for the first time since it was launched, and no longer have to wait up to 16 weeks for their first payment. The new claims process on Gov.uk takes about 10 minutes, with payments made in as little as three days.\n\nCouncil tax discount\n\nThere are several reasons why you may qualify for a discount on your council tax: it could be that you are on a low income, or that you live alone, or that you share the property with someone who does not have to pay.\n\nIf you are the only adult in your home, you will get a 25% discount on your council tax bill. When working out how many people live in a property, some aren\u2019t counted \u2013 they are called \u201cdisregarded\u201d people, explains Citizens Advice. That may include a young person, a student or a live-in carer. You may also get a discount if your partner is in a care home long term. The charity\u2019s website has full details.\n\nIf you are on a low income or claim benefits, you may be eligible for council tax reduction. Contact your council to apply for a reduction.\n\nPension credit\n\nOne benefit that a lot of people don\u2019t claim is pension credit. This gives people extra money to help with living costs if they are over state pension age and on a low income. It can also help with some housing costs.\n\nIt tops up your weekly income to \u00a3201.05 if you are single, or your joint weekly income to \u00a3306.85 if you have a partner, and you may be able to get extra sums on top if you have other responsibilities or costs.\n\nThe government\u2019s figures show that in the 2019-20 financial year up to \u00a31.7bn of available pension credit went unclaimed. On average that added up to about \u00a31,900 a year for each of the up to 850,000 families entitled to receive it who \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 didn\u2019t claim.\n\nTo find out if you are eligible and how much you could get, use the government\u2019s pension credit calculator.\n\nYou can apply online, by phone (0800 99 1234) or by post.\n\nView image in fullscreen Pension credit gives people extra money to help with living costs if they are over state pension age and on a low income. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA\n\nBereavement support\n\nYou may be able to get bereavement support payment if you have lost a partner. The Gov.uk website outlines the eligibility, how much you might be able to get and how to apply (you can do it online, by phone or by post).\n\nIf this does apply to you, a crucial date is only a few days away. Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, says that if you are unmarried, have children and your partner died between 9 April 2001 and 8 February 2023, you can possibly claim up to \u00a340,000 of backdated bereavement support, but only until 8 February this year. (The deadline relates to a law change after a court ruling.)\n\nLewis says that if you are unsure if you qualify, \u201cjust do it! The deadline\u2019s so close, cross [your] fingers and apply.\u201d\n\nHelp that is available\n\nEntitledto: the website entitledto.co.uk has a calculator you can use to see if you qualify for any state benefits. You need to answer questions about your household situation and your income, and it presents a list of any payments you may be entitled to. For each one it offers information and details of how to make a claim.\n\nTurn2us: the charity also offers a calculator, at benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk. You will need the same details to answer its questions. At the end it also presents a list of benefits you may qualify for, plus links to the sites you will need to go to if you want to start a claim. Turn2us also has a \u201cgrants search\u201d tool where you can find out if you could get help from charitable grants.\n\nCitizens Advice: the website citizensadvice.org.uk has information on benefits and a calculator. The charity also offers help via the phone or in person. You can search for your local office online, or call the adviceline on 0800 144 8848 in England or 0800 702 2020 in Wales."}

For some people, it can be a bit hard to believe that you can cook with banana peel \u2013 it feels like magic, as if you\u2019re creating food out of nothing \u2013 but it\u2019s a pretty common ingredient wherever bananas are grown around the world; they\u2019re rich in fibre and phenolic compounds with potent antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, too.\n\nGreen banana peel chutney (or curry)\n\nThis Bengali chutney and/or curry was a lucky find. It\u2019s a green-brown mush that looks pretty horrible, but it tastes incredible: spicy, savoury and satiating. I enjoyed it with wholemeal rice and a chapati for lunch, and was bowled over by the flavours.\n\nGreen banana skins have a delicious and complex flavour that makes them perfect for curries and savoury dishes; yellow or brown banana skins are sweeter, but they would work, too. Wherever possible, use only organic bananas, not least to avoid unnecessary exposure to the excessive use of fungicides and pesticides. After all, a third of the banana is its skin, so there\u2019s a clear financial incentive to consume it in its entirety.\n\nServes 2 as main with rice, or 4-6 alongside other curries\n\n250g organic green (or yellow) banana peel (from 3-4 bananas), or plantain peel\n\n\u00bd tsp turmeric powder\n\n1 tsp sea salt, plus extra to season\n\n1 small red onion (about 100g), peeled\n\n50g coriander stems, save some of the leaves for garnish and the rest for another use\n\n4 garlic cloves, peeled\n\n2 green chillies, plus a little sliced green chilli to serve\n\n3 tbsp mustard oil, or sunflower oil\n\n1 bay leaf (optional)\n\n1 dried red chilli (optional)\n\n1 tsp nigella seeds\n\n1 tbsp grated fresh ginger\n\n4 tbsp freshly grated coconut, or 2 tbsp desiccated coconut, plus extra to serve\n\nTo serve\n\nWholegrain rice and chapatis\n\nRinse the banana skins, then soak them in cold water for an hour.

Bring to a boil, turn down to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, or until tender (if using a pressure cooker, bring to a boil following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, then, when the pressure valve whistles, turn off and leave to cool for 30 minutes).\n\nDrain the cooked banana peel, put it in a blender with the red onion, coriander stems, garlic and green chillies, and blitz to a puree.\n\nPut the mustard oil in a frying pan on a medium heat, then add the bay leaf and dried red chilli, if using. Stir in the nigella seeds, grated ginger and grated coconut, and stir-fry for a minute until hot but not smoking.

When I open my eyes in the morning the dog is already at my bedside staring up at me, tail thumping against the floorboards.\n\nWhen I stand up the dog runs excited circles around me, barking and sneezing, as if the day held the promise of a long-awaited excursion to some super-fun dog thing.\n\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to look forward to.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes there is,\u201d my wife says, sitting up. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a 10.30 appointment at the dump.\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh,\u201d I say, although I\u2019m secretly pleased I\u2019ve reached a station in life where my visits to the dump are by appointment.\n\nThe dog runs down the stairs ahead of me, somersaulting over the last three steps and rolling across the hallway. It jumps to its feet, snorts and runs into the kitchen, then turns back to run towards me.\n\n\u201cWhy are you so happy?\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s dark, it\u2019s raining, and we\u2019re going to the dump without you.\u201d\n\nMy father-in-law\u2019s cottage is picturesque.

The dog completes two unhinged laps round the table, stopping at her feet.\n\n\u201cHave you had your pill yet?\u201d my wife says. The dog barks, turns several tight circles and sits up on its hind legs.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in those pills?\u201d I say.\n\nThree mornings later I am woken by the thumping of the dog\u2019s tail. In the dark beyond the mattress edge I can see its little outline juddering with enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cIf you knew where we were going,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019d be in no hurry.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re going to Cornwall. The dog hates Cornwall.\n\nI have not been to my father-in-law\u2019s cottage for a long time. The last person to visit was my oldest son, who went in mid-July, after it had lain empty for more than a year.

Years ago we used to go for a week every summer with the children, but I have never stayed there in late January.

There is the cooker my wife claims came from her mother\u2019s house when she got a better one in 1973, one of its four rings still clearly labelled DO NOT USE. The pump is working, but the pipes are frozen, including the one that refills the toilet.\n\nThe heating is not an issue, because there is no heating. There is a wood stove, and electricity, but not, for the purposes of this visit, in the same room: the single wall socket has stopped working. I spend the last moments of daylight reading the instructions on a packet of old-fashioned fuse wire speckled with mouse shit, before deciding just to run a long extension cable from the other room.\n\nStrangely for such a rustic setting, the house has very strong wifi. My wife and I sit side-by-side in front of the fire in our coats, watching Netflix on my laptop and eating the pistachios we brought.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m having a very good time,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the best bit,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go to bed eventually.\u201d\n\nThe night is unspeakably cold: in the morning I am sore from shivering, and up before sunrise to get the fire going again. The dog, by now, has given in to something like despair, wandering disconsolately between the stove and the front door.\n\n\u201cBack to your old self,\u201d I say.\n\nWe are packed and ready to go by the time the man comes about the wiring. He looks at the old fusebox with something like admiration. It is a big job, he says. He doesn\u2019t seem too sure he wants it.\n\n\u201cOK, well, I\u2019ll call you in the week,\u201d my wife says.\n\nWe wave goodbye, but when the man gets into his truck the dog tries to get in with him. This is a little embarrassing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re with us,\u201d I say to the dog. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going home right after this.\u201d\n\nBut the dog ignores me and keeps trying to make the leap into the truck\u2019s cab, falling back each time on to the frozen mud."}

In the southeast, Govia Thameslink Railway said it would run far fewer trains than normal on its Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern networks, and no services at all on some routes.\n\nThe last 24-hour strikes of the current wave come on Monday at CrossCountry, Chiltern and Great Western.

The overtime ban \u2013 which runs until the end of Tuesday \u2013 will make additional short-notice cancellations and disruption likely.\n\nNew powers to enforce minimum service levels by requiring some drivers to break strikes and work have not been used by train operators, despite government pressure.

It\u2019s been running since 2009 \u2013 you can read all about how we put it together here.\n\n\n\nWhat questions will I be asked?\n\nWe ask about age, location, occupation, hobbies, interests and the type of person you are looking to meet. If you do not think these questions cover everything you would like to know, tell us what\u2019s on your mind. Can I choose who I match with?\n\nNo, it\u2019s a blind date! But we do ask you a bit about your interests, preferences, etc \u2013 the more you tell us, the better the match is likely to be. Can I pick the photograph?\n\nNo, but don't worry: we'll choose the nicest ones. What personal details will appear?\n\nYour first name, job and age. How should I answer?\n\nHonestly but respectfully. Be mindful of how it will read to your date, and that Blind date reaches a large audience, in print and online. Will I see the other person\u2019s answers?\n\nNo. We may edit yours and theirs for a range of reasons, including length, and we may ask you for more details. Will you find me The One?\n\nWe\u2019ll try! Marriage! Babies! Can I do it in my home town?\n\nOnly if it\u2019s in the UK. Many of our applicants live in London, but we would love to hear from people living elsewhere. How to apply\n\nEmail blind.date@theguardian.com Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nDescribe Marjo in three words.\n\nFriendly, smart, fun.\n\nWhat do you think Marjo made of you?\n\nThat I was funny (I hope!), a good listener and a good dad.\n\nDid you go on anywhere?\n\nTo the train station.\n\nAnd \u2026 did you kiss?\n\nOn the cheek, when we met. Hopefully that didn\u2019t seem too forward.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?\n\nNot much. Maybe going out on a Saturday would have been slightly more relaxing for both of us.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\n9. Only because of the assumption that 10 is a date that leads to something after. Otherwise: beautiful person, excellent date.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nOf course, I\u2019m very happy to keep in touch with the kind, fun and interesting people of this world.\n\nView image in fullscreen Marjo and Edwin on their date\n\nMarjo on Edwin\n\nWhat were you hoping for?\n\nTo meet someone interesting in a new way, a tasty meal and good conversation.\n\nFirst impressions?\n\nLaughs from the start.

Kids. The menu.\n\nMost awkward moment?\n\nIt was getting late and I had to collect my son, so I may have rushed the dessert course a bit.\n\nGood table manners?\n\nExcellent.\n\nBest thing about Edwin?\n\nReally friendly and easy to chat with. The time passed quickly.\n\nWould you introduce Edwin to your friends?\n\nIt\u2019d be fun to do a Latin dance night with him and the mates \u2013 he could no doubt teach us a thing or two.\n\nDescribe Edwin in three words.\n\nThoughtful, warm, worldly.\n\nWhat do you think Edwin made of you?\n\nHopefully friendly and talkative. I\u2019d accidentally skipped lunch, so hungry, too \u2013 I was quick to order for the both of us.\n\nDid you go on somewhere?\n\nWe walked to the station together and then I hailed a taxi \u2013 it was quite late.\n\nAnd \u2026 did you kiss?\n\nOn the cheek.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?\n\nNot having to rush dessert.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\nThis is tough one. We had a great time and Edwin was lovely, but there was no romantic connection, so I\u2019m going to say 8.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nAs friends, for sure.\n\nMarjo and Edwin ate at Restaurant Hubert, Sydney.

Axar then unleashes a beaut: fired in before turning sharply past Root\u2019s outside edge. Yeah, nobody\u2019s playing that.\n\n\n\n6m ago 03.00 EST 24th over: England 119-2 (Pope 18, Root 4) Bumrah returns, with Rohit Sharma realising that there\u2019s a bit of reverse here to work with. The quick gets the penultimate ball to explode off the surface past Pope, but England\u2019s No.3 avoids giving away a maiden with a clip through the leg side for one.\n\n\n\n10m ago 02.55 EST 23rd over: England 118-2 (Pope 17, Root 4) Root gets off the mark with a tidy reverse-sweep for four. India have a much-needed wicket, though.\n\n\n\n12m ago 02.53 EST WICKET! Crawley c Iyer b Axar 76 (England 114-2) Hello, everybody! Sorry, England fans. Crawley smashes Axar for four and then gets a little too excited, trying the big shot again only to result in a big, ugly leading edge that finds the diving Shreyas Iyer at point. A beautiful knock from the England opener but there was a ton there for the taking.\n\n\n\n17m ago 02.49 EST James Wallace 22nd over: England 111-1 (Crawley 72, Pope 17) Ashwin is whipped out of the attack and replaced by the seam of Mukesh. Pope clips a full ball off his pads away for four to notch up the fifty partnership between this pair. Time for a drink and for me to skulk off. Thanks for your company. I feel suitably soothed. Taha Hashim is sidling into the OBO armchair and will guide you through to the close. Ta-ra.\n\n\n\n23m ago 02.43 EST 21st over: England 106-1 (Crawley 72, Pope 13) Kuldeep is worked to leg by Pope and the batters scamper a single. \u201cMorning Jim\u201d Back atcha, Guy Hornsby \u201cThis is a pretty good start from England so far (jinx alert). Getting India for under 400 will feel like a real victory, with the ageless Jimmy and the kids in the action. It\u2019s so good to see a captain that finally manages spinners well, a real blind spot for England in the past. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how we try and score runs. The bounce on this pitch has all but removed the reverse sweep from our armoury so it\u2019ll be much more in front of the wicket. Pope is really skittish again but isn\u2019t he always early on? If he can settle we\u2019re in for a good day.\u201d\n\n\n\n25m ago 02.40 EST 20th over: England 105-1 (Crawley 72, Pope 12) Crawley keeps chugging on his merry way, driving Ashwin away through cover for four and then pouncing on a shorter ball and foircing it away for four more through the off side. That brings the ton up for England.\n\n\n\n29m ago 02.36 EST 19th over: England 95-1 (Crawley 62, Pope 12) England rotate strike and take four singles. \u201cIndia\u2019s body language is not good at the moment.\u201d Chirps Andy Bradshaw. \u201cLads, you\u2019re 300 ahead, on a turning pitch and England have to bat last. But you\u2019re proper rattled. What could have caused it?\u201d Andy includes a meme or a gif or a whatever of Ben Stokes and the words Bazball. It\u2019s a bit of fun.\n\nUpdated at 02.38 EST\n\n32m ago 02.33 EST 18th over: England 91-1 (Crawley 60, Pope 10) Ashwin is causing Pope strife, dragging him across the crease and then getting the ball to spit back into him. A failed reverse-sweep nearly rolls back onto the stumps before a single gets the Papal one off strike. Bosh! Zak Crawley has no such problem \u2013 using his long levers to sweep into the stands for SIX!\n\n\n\n36m ago 02.30 EST 17th over: England 82-1 (Crawley 53, Pope 8) Kuldeep gets drifr and dip, just a single to Pope off the final ball of the over.\n\n\n\n37m ago 02.29 EST 16th over: England 81-1 (Crawley 53, Pope 7) Pope settles his nerves with a drive through cover for four. Or perhaps not \u2013 a spooned cut shot nearly carries to the fielder at point. You do not, repeat not, want to give your wicket needlessly on this butterscotch beauty of a batting wicket.\n\n\n\n47m ago 02.19 EST 14th over: England 74-1 (Crawley 51, Pope 2) Ashwin looks dangerous, Pope gets an inside edge on a drive, going with hard hands at the ball. Ashwin then beats him on the outside edge for the third time already in this innings. Pope is a skittish starter, India sense this and want to keep him tied down.\n\n\n\n50m ago 02.16 EST 13th over: England 72-1 (Crawley 50, Pope 1) Zak Crawley goes to fifty with a stylish flick through mid-off followed by a slog sweep for SIX! The big fella has decided to go pedal to the metal. Running toward the danger and all that.\n\nUpdated at 02.16 EST\n\n53m ago 02.13 EST 12th over: England 62-1 (Crawley 40, Pope 1) All of a sudden it is jittery out there for England. Ashwin rips one past Pope\u2019s edge and there\u2019s a harum scarum single too.\n\n\n\n55m ago 02.11 EST 11th over: England 54-0 (Crawley 35, Pope 0) What a bonkers and brilliant game this is. Pope arrives at the crease fresh off one of the great overseas Test knocks by an Englishman and pokes forward to a fizzing ball from Kuldeep. The ball misses the edge of his bat and the off stump by the width of a gnat\u2019s eyebrow\u2026 but Pope drags his back foot out of the crease with his forward lunge. KS Bharat spills the ball and the chance is gone in a flicker. What a moment.\n\n\n\n1h ago 02.07 EST Ayeeechi! KS Bharat misses a chance to stump Ollie Pope first ball!\n\n\n\n1h ago 02.06 EST WICKET! Duckett c Patidar b Kuldeep Yadav 21 (England 59-1) Kuldeep Strikes! The wrist spinner is brought into the attack to replace Bumrah and removes Duckett with his second ball. Turn, bounce, edge taken and well caught by Patidar in the slips. India have the breakthrough, Duckett hauls himself off the pitch, he\u2019s left plenty out there.\n\n\n\n1h ago 02.03 EST 10th over: England 54-0 (Crawley 20, Duckett 34) England rollocking along at more than six an over so far. Crawley flicks Ashwin away off his pads for four more.\n\n\n\n1h ago 02.00 EST 9th over: England 54-0 (Crawley 20, Duckett 34) What an over for England and Zac Crawley. Bumrah to Crawley \u2013 Four. Through midwicket. Pull shot. Bumrah to Crawley \u2013 Four. Wide of gully. Soft hands. Bumrah to Crawley \u2013 Four. On Drive. On the up. Bumrah to Crawley \u2013 Four. On Drive. Half volley. Three of those were successive and brought up the fifty partnership for the opening pair. England flying out of the traps.\n\nUpdated at 02.01 EST\n\n1h ago 01.56 EST 8th over: England 38-0 (Crawley 18, Duckett 20) Crawley dances down to Ashwin but doesn\u2019t quite get to the pitch, the ball flies away in the air through midwicket where Shubman Gill DROPS a hard chance, diving away to his left. Tricky, but you\u2019ve seen them taken. Let off for Crawley and England.\n\n\n\n1h ago 01.54 EST 7th over: England 34-0 (Crawley 11, Duckett 17) Crawley pockets a single to the leg side and Duckett clips off his hip for another. Bumrah slips in a slower ball but Crawley spots it and pats it back. G\u2019morning John Starbuck \u201cIt\u2019s Zak Crawley\u2019s birthday as well as Ida\u2019s. What\u2019s the most appropriate score for him to make today?\u201d I couldn\u2019t put a figure on it John, let\u2019s just settle on\u2026 lots.\n\n\n\n1h ago 01.48 EST Here come the players for the afternoon session. Jasprit Bumrah is going to start with the new ball. Zac Crawley on strike. Buckle up knuckleheads.\n\n\n\n1h ago 01.44 EST We interrupt this OBO broadcast\u2026 Hearty congratulations to my old pal Alex and his partner Hayley who have welcomed baby Ida into the world in the last few hours. Welcome to the Jungle. Alex sends an early hours picture in his dressing gown with, if anything, not enough of his chest on show. I\u2019ll pass on the advice my old man gave me: \u201cThe first 35 years are the hardest\u2026\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all a blur at the moment\u201d says Alex. This one\u2019s for you old chum:\n\n\n\n2h ago 01.17 EST I\u2019m off to brew up something strong and ice my eyeballs. I\u2019ll leave you with some prime James Anderson. Eight overs and 2-17 in over an hour of relentless accuracy and skill this morning. James Anderson that is a lovely delivery \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8#INDvENG pic.twitter.com/SOQCkYdJRf \u2014 Cricket on TNT Sports (@cricketontnt) February 3, 2024\n\n\n\n2h ago 01.07 EST Lunch: England 32-0 (trail by 364 runs) 6th over: England 32-0 (Crawley 11, Duckett 17) England\u2019s session, categorically. Ashwin rattles through the final over but he can\u2019t find the breakthrough. Crawley is watchful and clips a single off the last ball before striding off for some scran with his scrappy sidekick in tow. \ud83d\udea8 LUNCH \ud83d\udea8\n\n\n\nA good morning\u2019s work from England who got the wickets needed and have started positively with the bat.\n\n\n\nThey head into the interval on 32-0.\n\n\n\nFollow it all on the @BBCSport app \ud83d\udcf1 #BBCCricket #INDvENG pic.twitter.com/6MddpFYXEE \u2014 Test Match Special (@bbctms) February 3, 2024\n\nUpdated at 01.12 EST\n\n2h ago 01.04 EST 5th over: England 31-0 (Crawley 14, Duckett 17) Kuldeep Yadav replaces Bumrah which feels like a victory for England. Rohit has a slip and a short leg in for Crawley who uses his crease well to make room to glide away through the off side for two. Kuldeep flicks his wrist and sends down a wrong\u2019un but Crawley picks it and defends back to the bowler. He keeps strike for the final over of the session with a single off the last ball.\n\n\n\n2h ago 01.01 EST 4th over: England 28-0 (Crawley 11, Duckett 17) Crawley and Duckett are really excellent at negating dominating these tricksy little sessions. They did it a few times in the Ashes and in the last Test at Hyderabad and they are doing it again here. Duckett slams Kumar through the covers for four and then rocks back to slap another boundary through point. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t left a ball since The Beatles broke up!\u201d chirps Eoin Morgan on the commentary. And another! Duckett picks up his third boundary of the over by depositing a wide delivery with a flat bat to the fence on the off side. England taking a bitesize chunk out of the target before lunch.\n\n\n\n2h ago 00.55 EST 3rd over: England 16-0 (Crawley 11, Duckett 5) A bucket hatted Ben Stokes watches on with a smile on his face as Crawley opens the face to glide Bumrah wide of gully for four.\n\n\n\n2h ago 00.51 EST 2nd over: England 10-0 (Crawley 5, Duckett 5) Lucky ducky! Duckett plays an angled defence to a full ball from Mukesh Kumar and very nearly chops onto his stumps\u2026 the ball flying away instead for four runs to get England moving. A single brings Crawley on strike. Shot! Shades of KP as Crawley gets on the front foot and flicks away imperiously through midwicket for four.\n\n\n\n2h ago 00.48 EST 1st over: England 0-0 (Crawley 0, Duckett 0) Bumrah splurts and stutters in that unmistakeable fashion, arriving at the crease and unleashing his bull-whip at the waiting Zak Crawley. A probing over, Crawley watches a few go by outside off stump and misses out on a flick off his pads. Close! Crawley has a swish at a shorter ball and for a second the bowler thought he had feathered it to the keeper. No dice though. A maiden to start. Brian Withington has been casting his discerning eye over the scorecard: \u201cFine effort from the England bowlers and remarkably only two extras in 112 overs. Great discipline.\u201d\n\n"}

The 2024 Six Nations, and indeed the 2027 World Cup, began and ended on a breezy Marseille night as Ireland helped themselves to a bonus-point victory against France, dismantled the tournament favourites, wrote the blueprint for the next chapter of the Andy Farrell era and established a lasting peace in the Middle East.\n\nToo much? Too soon? Well, why not? Sport has always been about the dreaming as well as the doing, and for the thousands of Irish fans huddled together in a little corner of the Stade V\u00e9lodrome this was a night for shouting down the noise, for standing up in the face of hostility, for setting aside past torments. It was an examination and an exhibition, to be sure, but also a kind of exorcism. A night, in short, for pencilling in Joe McCarthy for the next two Lions squads, climbing back aboard the hype train and daring to be hurt again.\n\nAnd yes, France were unspeakably poor, weirdly poor, particularly in a first half that may well go down as one of the worst of the Fabien Galthi\u00e9 era. They were missing an all-time great in Antoine Dupont, still weathering plenty of injuries and reduced to 14 in the first half after the brainless dismissal of Paul Willemse.\n\nFor all this, there was something vaguely thrilling in the way Ireland simply stopped them in their tracks, met violence with violence, greeted the rolling wave of noise that came their way with patience, craft and pure, unanswerable excellence.\n\nPerhaps this was no surprise when you took the wider context into account: a Six Nations curtain-raiser that also felt like a palate-cleanser, a match taking place in the foothills of a great and gruesome pain, wrought on consecutive October nights in Paris. No grand slam can ever truly fill the void of what was taken from Ireland and France at last year\u2019s World Cup, but there can be a certain comfort in the rebirth of a fresh cycle. Rugby is the wound, and rugby is also the bandage.\n\nNevertheless, they seemed to go about it in subtly different ways. Galthi\u00e9 had spoken in the buildup to this game about \u201cfighting intensity\u201d, about \u201cIreland forcing us into making 200 tackles, 200 rucks without possession\u201d, the balance between flair and combat tilted towards combat. The selection of Yoram Moefana on the wing and Paul Gabrillagues in the pack suggested the France coach was prepared to back his words with actions.\n\nAnd perhaps this is an entirely natural response to trauma, of having something you thought was in your grasp snatched from you. You opt for physicality partly because it is a known known, something you can control. But also partly because you\u2019re still hurting and brute force feels like the appropriate response.\n\nWhile there was a belligerence and a heft to France here, it felt unfocused and uneven, aggressive in the wrong places and passive in the wrong places, a departure from the things they have always done best. Their scrum was solid and their maul was stirring. But it\u2019s largely immaterial if you\u2019re just going to let Tadhg Beirne run straight through you.\n\nView image in fullscreen Tadhg Beirne powers through the feeble France defence for one of Ireland\u2019s five tries. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA\n\nWillemse\u2019s yellow card came at just the right time for Ireland, just as they were beginning to settle into the game. The red \u2013 for a second identical offence \u2013 encapsulated France\u2019s poor judgment all night. The television cameras captured him sitting solemnly on the bench, his head down, his shoulders hunched and withdrawn, which you could argue is what they should have been doing in the first place.\n\n\n\nThe Irish second-rows, on the other hand, were sensational all night. In the beastly two-metre McCarthy, Ireland have the sort of imposing physical specimen that they have traditionally had to import, like avocados. But here, as he disrupted and dominated, as he forged an ominous partnership with Beirne, it was possible to catch a glimpse of a sparkling future. Yes: he\u2019ll make a cracking NFL player one day.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Breakdown Free weekly newsletter The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Do you start fresh, wipe the slate clean? Or do you keep doing the same things that brought you to the brink of glory?\n\nYou do both. You endure and evolve at the same time. You find new challenges, new frontiers to conquer.\n\nIt had been more than 50 years since Ireland beat France away from home by more than a couple of points. No Irish team had ever won at this stadium. Thirteen of this Ireland squad were in the Leinster side that so heartbreakingly crumbled in the closing minutes of the Champions Cup final against La Rochelle a couple of years ago.\n\n\n\nSo yes, even amid the familiar rattle of Six Nations triumph, Ireland are still breaking new ground, finding their outer limits. The next World Cup is almost four years away and the last is not even four months past. And yes, it\u2019s the hope that kills you. But also, it\u2019s hope that makes you feel alive."}

His Instagram page announced the news: \u201cWayne S Kramer. Peace be with you. April 30 1948 \u2013 February 2 2024.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Detroit, Kramer teamed with teenage friend and fellow guitarist Fred \u201cSonic\u201d Smith, each of them influenced as much by free jazz as they were by R&B and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. Along with the frontman Rob Tyner, they made MC5 into an incendiary force in their city\u2019s music scene, alongside peers such as the Stooges.\n\nMC5 (short for Motor City 5) quickly built a formidable live reputation playing on bills with the likes of Cream, and were signed to Elektra in 1968. Their debut album, Kick Out the Jams, was released the following year: a live recording from Detroit\u2019s Grande Ballroom where the band had made their name.\n\nThe band were proud of their working-class roots and were charged with revolutionary zeal from the outset; manager John Sinclair formed the White Panther Party and the band protested against the Vietnam war and the Democratic National Convention. Buoyed by an astonishingly heavy guitar sound from Kramer and Smith, the words \u201ckick out the jams\u201d \u2013 hollered by Tyner on the album\u2019s title track \u2013 they became synonymous with resistance, and pointed the way towards the punk rock of the 1970s.\n\n\u201cPeople said \u2018Oh wow, \u201cKick out the jams\u201d means break down restrictions,\u2019 and it made good copy, but when we wrote it, we didn\u2019t have that in mind,\u201d Kramer later said, explaining it was directed more at bands who would incessantly jam.\n\nView image in fullscreen MC5 in 1967.

Photograph: Leni Sinclair/Getty Images\n\nThe group hopped to Atlantic Records and released their first studio album, Back in the USA, in 1970, followed by High Time the next year. Each album flopped commercially; bankrupt and mired in drug use, MC5 split in 1972.\n\nKramer continued his music career alongside dealing drugs, and was jailed for four years following a bust in 1975. After his release in 1979, he joined funk-rockers Was (Not Was) and was an itinerant figure on the New York City underground music scene, but spent much of the 1980s out of the spotlight, working mostly as a carpenter. In the mid-90s he began releasing music again, as a solo artist signed to punk label Epitaph Records.\n\nTyner and Smith died in the early to mid-1990s, but in 2001 Kramer formed a supergroup to perform MC5 music, including the Cult\u2019s Ian Astbury and Motorhead\u2019s Lemmy. While the lineup didn\u2019t stay quite so starry, MC5 were reignited as a touring entity and played gigs across the world in various iterations, including a 50th anniversary tour in 2018. That year he also published his memoir, The Hard Stuff: Dope, Crime, the MC5 and My Life of Impossibilities.\n\nAt the time of his death, Kramer was preparing to release a long-awaited third studio album from the band. Explaining why he was returning, Kramer said: \u201cI think it was time to reignite that spirit of 1968, the spirit of my generation, when we were all young people. I think we\u2019re at a very dangerous time in our history. And I think if we don\u2019t all organise, come together, and step up, we could lose it all. Democracy could go away. The forces that we\u2019re up against are not joking. This is not playtime. This is serious.\u201d\n\nA release was being planned for spring 2024.\n\nIn later life, Kramer also co-created the US arm of Billy Bragg\u2019s Jail Guitar Doors initiative, providing musical instruments for prison inmates.\n\nAmong those paying tribute to Kramer following his death was former collaborator Tom Morello, guitarist with Rage Against the Machine. \u201cBrother Wayne Kramer was the best man I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe possessed a one of a kind mixture of deep wisdom & profound compassion, beautiful empathy and tenacious conviction.\u201d"}

Lower main stand tickets for his final game at Anfield are priced at \u00a312,000 on one resale site (well, they are right behind the dugout) and a seat on the Kop is going for \u00a34,250. They will get it too, and possibly more nearer the time, should the price of a ticket for Wolves on 19 May include the presentation of the Premier League trophy to a departing idol.\n\nKlopp was asked on Friday whether he had contemplated the perfect Premier League send-off. \u201cI am not a dreamer,\u201d he replied. Having lost out by a single point in two other title races with Manchester City, and with 16 matches to go, it pays not to be.\n\nBut the grounded realism of a 56-year-old and City\u2019s reputation for hitting their stride at this time of year will not diminish the dreams of those around the Liverpool manager. His players have responded to the shock of his planned exit with nine goals in two games. Norwich and Chelsea felt the force of a team that, Klopp believes, have taken the next step in their development since the goalless draw against Manchester United before Christmas.\n\nLiverpool dismantled a fallen Chelsea with two of their most influential players this season, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah, on the bench and in the treatment room respectively. It is testament to the strength of Klopp\u2019s rebuilt squad that Alexander-Arnold\u2019s undisputed reign at right-back is being challenged by the emergence of Conor Bradley. Another victory at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday would not only take Liverpool eight points clear of Arsenal and the defending champions, who would have two games in hand, but intensify what Klopp calls \u201cthe outside talk\u201d surrounding a title-winning farewell. On paper at least, Arsenal represents the toughest away assignment that Liverpool have left.\n\n\u201cIf I wouldn\u2019t have announced what I announced a week ago, what would be different?\u201d Klopp asked. The cost of tickets for Wolves for a start. \u201cIt is: \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to win another Premier League, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to win that, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to do that after all the things we did over the years and how close we were?\u2019 It\u2019s all the same. The only little difference is that now they say: \u2018For J\u00fcrgen.\u2019 That\u2019s the only thing. Nothing else changed and that is the mood I\u2019m in.\n\n\u201cOf course I want to win the league. Do I know if we have a chance, really? It looks like we can be around it but there are so many games between now and then. We have to play them all and we have to win them all, which is absolutely crazy. I just cannot think about it. I am not a dreamer. But if you ask me if it would be nice then, yes, very nice for everybody involved and the whole Liverpool world. But it\u2019s not difficult to block that out because it is no different to other years before. If it can generate a few extra percent it would be good but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s needed because we are already at 100% and that is fine.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen William Saliba challenges Diogo Jota in Liverpool\u2019s 2-0 win at the Emirates in the FA Cup in January. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nCity\u2019s pedigree leaves Liverpool with little margin for error even at this stage of a title race. Klopp\u2019s team finished 18 points clear of their closest rivals when ending a 30-year wait to be crowned champions of England in 2020. Better to lead than to chase is the opinion of a manager who was unable to celebrate that long-awaited triumph with his own supporters owing to the pandemic. The opportunity to party together at the end of his final season increases the importance of Liverpool\u2019s chase.\n\nKlopp, who has an injury concern over Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, said: \u201cWe have only been ahead of them once properly and then we won it, and that was by 25 points at one point before Covid kicked in and all these wonderful people wanted to null and void the league. I forgot Rio Ferdinand was quite front-footed on that and I gave him an interview the other day!\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the other fights when we were slightly behind them we lost the race. It was one point for five or six weeks and it stayed one point because we both won all of our games. You can\u2019t compare. It\u2019s really not too important. What we know is if you want to win the Premier League you better win an awful lot of football games.\u201d\n\nKlopp believes his team must and will improve on their last performance at Arsenal four weeks ago, a 2-0 FA Cup win that owed much to the hosts\u2019 profligacy. More dominance in possession and better control of the opponent is his request. \u201cWe are becoming a better version of ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is still so much space for improvement.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThis is the best league in the world and we are top of the table, what does that say? Are there any bad players in this team? No. But the job now is not to reflect on what they did and how fantastic they are or how good looking they are on top of it. It is about us digging deep into the season, hold your breath, buckle up and go for it. The base is good and still to be extended. Make sure we are in a good position for the run-in and then we will see.\u201d"}

Given the way Ireland went about their work in this 38-17 victory in Marseille, you guess they\u2019re going to take an awful lot of stopping again this year, more of it, perhaps, than any of the other four teams in the championship can offer.\n\nThree months on from the World Cup, the game was pitched as a little glimpse of the final that might have been. In fact, only the Irish were in anything like the same sort of form they had been in that tournament. Really, the game was a first look at these two teams\u2019 answers to the question they\u2019ve both had hanging over them ever since those last moments of the knock-out rounds \u2013 what now? France clearly have not come up with an answer, yet. They were all over the place, their performance was strewn with handling errors and missed tackles.\n\nThey badly missed Antoine Dupont\u2019s leadership, and his ability to turn a game when it\u2019s going against his team. Ireland, on the other hand, came on as strong and slick as ever, and even better at the set-pieces.\n\nIreland had clearly been doing some repair work on their lineout, which was pretty rickety by the end of the World Cup. France tested it early with a kick to touch, the Irish won that one with a throw to Tadhg Beirne, and two more after it in the next few minutes.\n\nOne was in their own 22, after Damian Penaud was tackled into touch by Hugo Keenan, the other in France\u2019s, after Peter O\u2019Mahony gamely chose to have Jack Crowley kick a penalty into the corner. That lineout wound up with a penalty just in front of the posts, which Crowley kicked to give them a three-nil lead.\n\nFirst blood to the Irish then, and they seemed to grow stronger for the sight of it. Minutes later, they were a man up too, after Paul Willemse was shown a yellow card, and sent to the bunker, after he clattered into Andrew Porter\u2019s head. Porter was tackling Mathieu Jalibert at the time, and Willemse, charging through afterwards, caught him square on the jaw with his shoulder. The French finally won a little bit of relief nine minutes later when the referee, Karl Dickson, told their skipper Gr\u00e9gory Alldritt that Willemse was going to be allowed back into the game. Temporarily so, as it turned out.\n\nAlldritt didn\u2019t have much time to enjoy the good news. Moments later Jamison Gibson-Park scored Ireland\u2019s first try. It came off the back of a couple of barnstorming runs by Bundee Aki, who has clearly brought his red hot form from the World Cup with him into this year\u2019s championship. France have one of the beefier midfields in Jonathan Danty and Ga\u00ebl Fickou, but Aki made hamburger out of them.\n\nThe Irish had started so fast that the French were clinging on by their fingernails already. They only just managed to stop Ireland scoring again a few minutes later, when Crowley was tackled just short of the line, and the ball was held up under Tadhg Furlong after he had dived over it. Crowley missed a penalty from in front afterwards, and the French finally got a toehold in the game when Tomas Ramos kicked their first three points. It signalled another swing in the momentum of the game, in so much as everything immediately started to get much worse for the French.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jamison Gibson-Park of Ireland dives over to score his side\u2019s first try. Photograph: Harry Murphy/Sportsfile/Getty Images\n\nMoments later Peato Mauvaka hit Crowley with a thumping tackle, which would have been well and good if Crowley had not already shipped the ball on to Beirne, who charged through the yawning hole Mauvaka had left in the French line to score, unopposed, under the posts.\n\nThat made it 17-3, then, and then minutes after Willemse was shown a second yellow for yet another shoulder-charge, this one on Caelan Doris. Once, of course as another Irishman memorably put it, may be regarded as a misfortune, twice begins to look like carelessness.\n\nWe will need a lip-reader to tell us whether that was what Porter was whispering as Willemse walked off the field. Now they were 14 points down, and only had 14 men left, France finally started to play. They strung together their best attack of the half (to be fair, they only made two of them, so it was slim pickings), and they engineered a four-on-two overlap which allowed Penaud to score to make it 17-10 at the break.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Breakdown Free weekly newsletter The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which should have settled it, only, as often seems to be the way these days, France played better with 14 than they had with 15.\n\nThey rallied when Paul Gabrillagues scored off a pick and go, awarded after an interminable series of replays, and Ireland lost O\u2019Mahony in the same passage of play when he was sent to the sin-bin because he had collapsed a maul in the run-up to it. But that rule works both ways, Ireland scored once more when down to 14 themselves, when Dan Sheehan drove over for the bonus-point try after they kicked another penalty to touch.\n\nRonan Kelleher added one more from a similar move in the final minutes to make a right old rout of it, ensuring this was Ireland\u2019s biggest ever away win over France.\n\nSo Ireland are favourites for the title already, and the French have a whole lot more thinking to do."}

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said at least 18 pro-Iran fighters were killed in eastern Syria during strikes believed carried out by the US.\n\nAt least 26 major sites housing pro-Iranian groups were destroyed in Syria, including weapons depots, the Observatory said. Warplanes destroyed 17 positions in the eastern Deir ez-Zor province, three attacks targeting al-Mayadeen and one striking Albu Kamal, near the Iraqi border.\n\nA weapons warehouse and a command centre belonging to pro-Iranian groups were also targeted in western Iraq, along the Syrian border, resulting in at least \u201csome injuries\u201d, two Iraqi security sources told Agence France-Presse.\n\nAn Iraqi military spokesperson, Yahya Rasool, said US airstrikes were launched at Iraqi border areas and warned that the attacks could ignite instability in the region. \u201cThese airstrikes constitute a violation of Iraqi sovereignty, undermine the efforts of the Iraqi government and pose a threat that could lead Iraq and the region into dire consequences.\u201d\n\nUS officials told CNN that the US had no plan to bomb Iran, which would represent a significant escalation. Administration officials have repeatedly stressed that Washington does not intend to go to war with Iran, despite the accusation that it had armed the groups behind the Tower 22 attack.\n\nIran has also previously warned the US not to launch any direct strike on Iranian territory, warning of a swift and dramatic response if the US did so.\n\nLloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, emphasised that further bombing raids were planned. \u201cThis is the start of our response,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe president has directed additional actions\u201d against Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard and what it called affiliated militias accountable for their attacks on US and allied forces.\n\nJohn Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, said the strikes lasted about 30 minutes. \u201cThese responses began tonight. They\u2019re not going to end tonight. So there will be additional responses. There will be additional action that we will take, all designed to put an end to these attacks and to take away capability by the IRGC.\u201d\n\nThe 85 targets were grouped in seven different locations: four in Syria and three in Iraq, according to US officials. Lt Gen Douglas Sims, director for operations on the joint staff, said the timing of the strikes was determined by the weather.\n\n\u201cThe initial indications are that we hit exactly what we meant to hit with a number of secondary explosions associated with the ammunition and logistics locations,\u201d Sims said, although this could not be verified.\n\nOn Thursday, the US said it blamed Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of Iran-linked militias, for the deadly drone attack last weekend on the remote Tower 22 logistics base in Jordan, near the border with Syria and Iraq. Three US army reservists were killed after living quarters were struck at night and more than 80 wounded.\n\nView image in fullscreen President Joe Biden attends the service for fallen service members in Dover, Delaware, on Friday.

However, on Tuesday, Kataib Hezbollah, the Iranian group suspected by the US of conducting the Tower 22 attack, said it had suspended military activity against the \u201coccupying forces\u201d.\n\nIt said it wanted to avoid embarrassing the Iraqi government, which has in the past publicly complained about US retaliatory strikes against Iran-linked militias, arguing they amounted to a violation of its sovereignty.\n\nThe airstrikes only came on Friday night, a few hours after Biden attended a solemn military ritual at a Delaware airbase for the return of the three dead soldiers. Biden did not speak at the tribute, but did meet with families of those who had been killed.\n\nAlthough the US is free from its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, surging tensions in the Middle East, sparked by the Israel-Hamas fighting, threaten to drag American forces back into regional conflict."}

A former White House aide testified that Trump angrily threw a plate of food at a wall in the White House \u2013 smearing it with ketchup \u2013 after his attorney general at the time publicly denied Trump\u2019s lies that there had been voter fraud in the race won by Biden.\n\nFriday\u2019s remarks from Kaplan are also sure to open Trump to renewed criticism over his mistreatment of women.\n\nKaplan represented Carroll in a separate legal matter that saw the former Elle magazine writer sue Trump on accusations that he sexually abused her in a department store changing room in the mid-1990s. Carroll\u2019s lawsuit asserted that Trump then defamed her as he attacked her credibility.\n\nOn 26 January, a jury in federal court in New York awarded Carroll $18.3m in compensatory damages as well as $65m in punitive retribution over defamatory statements that Trump made against her. Those damages were in addition to an award of about $5m that the presumptive 2024 Republican White House nominee was ordered to pay in May after being found liable for abusing Carroll.\n\nTrump has said he intends to appeal the recent verdict awarded to Carroll, which came as he grapples with more than 90 criminal charges in various jurisdictions for subversion of the 2020 election, illegal retention of government secrets after he left the Oval Office, and hush-money payments to an adult film actor who has alleged extramarital sex with him.\n\nFor her part, Kaplan appeared on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America on Monday and expressed confidence that her team would be able to collect the judgment against Trump.\n\n\u201cWe might not get it right way,\u201d she said. \u201cBut one way or the other, he owns a lot of real estate. It can be sold.\u201d"}

US forces have attacked more than 80 targets in Iraq and Syria in a wide-ranging air assault on sites belonging to Iran-linked militias and Tehran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard. At least 18 pro-Iran fighters were killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor reported.

The US military\u2019s Central Command said it struck with more than 125 bombs in an attack that took place around midnight local time in what was described as the first of multiple attacks against the groups. For a summary of those developments, see our previous post below. Meanwhile, deadly attacks were reported early on Saturday in the overcrowded Gaza border town of Rafah as international mediators readied a new push to seal a reportedly tentative truce deal between Israel and Hamas. Powerful explosions were heard in Rafah shortly after midnight, with the Hamas-run health ministry later reporting 14 people killed in two strikes in the town, which the UN called \u201ca pressure cooker of despair\u201d.

And here\u2019s our full report on the US airstrikes in Syria and Iraq.\n\nUpdated at 02.07 EST\n\n5h ago 22.00 EST Summary It\u2019s 6am in Baghdad and Damascus and we\u2019ll pause this live coverage for now. You can see our full report on the US airstrikes here. And here\u2019s a rundown on the day\u2019s events. Thanks for reading. US military forces have attacked more than 80 targets in Iraq and Syria in a wide-ranging air assault on sites belonging to Iran-linked militias and Tehran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard. The US military\u2019s Central Command said it had struck with more than 125 bombs in an attack that took place around midnight local time (4pm ET) in what is being described as the first of multiple attacks against the groups. The airstrikes took place over about 30 minutes on Friday, and three of the sites struck were in Iraq and four were in Syria, said Lt Gen Douglas Sims, director of the joint staff.\n\nInitial reports from the ground were limited. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said at least 18 Iran-backed fighters have been killed in strikes in eastern Syria. At least 26 important sites housing pro-Iran groups including weapons depots had been destroyed in raids striking a large swath of eastern Syria, stretching more than 100km (62 miles) from the city of Deir ez-Zor to Albu Kamal, near the Iraq border, the monitoring group told AFP.\n\nThe US strikes had been launched in retaliation for the drone strike that killed three US troops in Jordan. The US said on Thursday it blamed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of Iran-linked militias, for the attack last weekend on the remote Tower 22 logistics base in Jordan, near the border with Syria and Iraq. Three US army reservists were killed after a living quarters was struck at night and more than 80 wounded.\n\nUS officials have said there were no plans to bomb Iran, which would represent a significant escalation. US administration officials have repeatedly stressed that Washington does not intend to go to war with Iran, despite the accusation that it had armed the groups behind the Tower 22 attack.\n\nPresident Joe Biden warned after the attacks began that the US would retaliate if an American was hurt. His statement said: \u201cThe United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world. But let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: if you harm an American, we will respond.\u201d John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, said the responses \u201cbegan tonight. They\u2019re not going to end tonight.\u201d\n\nAn Iraqi military spokesperson said US airstrikes were launched at Iraqi border areas, warning that the attacks could ignite instability in the region. Yahya Rasool said in a statement: \u201cThese airstrikes constitute a violation of Iraqi sovereignty, undermine the efforts of the Iraqi government and pose a threat that could lead Iraq and the region into dire consequences.\u201d\n\nThe US announced new sanctions and charges aimed at the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , apparently timed to coincide with the American strikes. The US Treasury Department said it was imposing sanctions on six officials in the cyber-electronic command of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps over activities targeting critical infrastructure and was hitting a network of suppliers providing \u201cmaterials and sensitive technology for Iran\u2019s ballistic missile and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs\u201d. As well, prosecutors said they had seized $108m used in an oil laundering scheme to fund the Guards\u2019 elite Quds Force.\n\nRepublican senator Roger Wicker, a ranking member of the armed services committee, criticised the Biden administration for the airstrikes coming \u201cfar too late\u201d. The Democratic chairman of the Senate armed services committee, Jack Reed, said he supported Biden\u2019s \u201crobust action\u201d and \u201cIran\u2019s proxy forces in Syria and Iraq have been dealt a significant blow\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 22.30 EST\n\n6h ago 21.18 EST In the US, a Republican senator who is a ranking member of the armed services committee has criticised how long the US has taken to launch the attacks in Iraq and Syria. Roger Wicker said: These military strikes are welcome, but come far too late for the three brave Americans who died and the nearly 50 wounded. Iran and its proxies have tried to kill American soldiers and sink our warships 165 times while the Biden administration congratulates itself for doing the bare minimum. Instead of giving the ayatollah the bloody nose that he deserves, we continue to give him a slap on the wrist. View image in fullscreen Republican senator Roger Wicker. Photograph: Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock On the Democratic side, Reuters also reports, the chairman of the Senate armed services committee, Jack Reed, said: Iran\u2019s proxy forces in Syria and Iraq have been dealt a significant blow, and Iranian-linked militias around the Middle East should understand that they, too, will be held accountable. I salute the brave US military members who carried out today\u2019s strikes, and I support President Biden\u2019s robust action. These strikes, in concert with wise diplomacy, send a clear signal that the United States will continue to take appropriate action to protect our personnel and our interests.\n\nUpdated at 21.19 EST\n\n7h ago 20.32 EST The US strikes in Iraq and Syria appeared to stop short of directly targeting Iran or senior leaders of the Revolutionary Guard Quds Force within its borders as Washington tries to prevent the conflict from escalating further. The Associated Press reports it is unclear what the impact of the strikes will be. Days of US warnings may have sent militia members scattering into hiding. With multiple groups operating at various locations in several countries, a knockout blow is unlikely, the news agency says. One of the main Iran-backed militias, Kataib Hezbollah, said it was suspending attacks on American troops, but others have vowed to continue fighting, casting themselves as champions of the Palestinian cause amid the war in Gaza. An Iraqi army spokesman said the city of al-Qaim and areas along the country\u2019s border with Syria had been hit in the US strikes. The attacks \u201cconstitute a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and undermine the efforts of the Iraqi government, posing a threat that will pull Iraq and the region to undesirable consequences\u201d, Yahya Rasool said in a statement. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the US alerted the Iraqi government prior to carrying out the strikes. Just Friday morning, Iran\u2019s hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi, reiterated earlier promises by Tehran to potentially retaliate for any US strikes targeting its interests. We \u201cwill not start a war, but if a country, if a cruel force wants to bully us, the Islamic Republic of Iran will give a strong response\u201d, he said. The US has blamed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a broad coalition of Iran-backed militias, for last weekend\u2019s drone attack in Jordan which killed three American troops. Some of the militias have been a threat to US bases for years, but the groups intensified their assaults in the wake of Israel\u2019s war with Hamas.\n\nUpdated at 21.30 EST\n\n8h ago 19.33 EST US imposes sanctions over Iran cyber and missile programs, seizes $108m The US announced new sanctions and charges aimed at the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as Washington launched the retaliatory airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. They measures were among a number taken by Washington and apparently timed to coincide with deadly strikes on pro-Iran fighters. Agence France-Presse reports the US Treasury Department said on Friday it was imposing sanctions on six officials in the cyber-electronic command of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) over activities targeting critical infrastructure. In a separate notice, the Treasury added it was also hitting a network of suppliers providing \u201cmaterials and sensitive technology for Iran\u2019s ballistic missile and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs\u201d. In a third measure, prosecutors also announced they had seized $108m used in an oil laundering scheme to fund the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 elite Quds Force. View image in fullscreen Iranian Revolutionary Guard members in Tehran. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA The moves came shortly after President Joe Biden blamed \u201cradical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq\u201d for last weekend\u2019s drone attack on a base in Jordan that killed three American troops. As the US launched Friday\u2019s strikes, Biden warned that such attacks would \u201ccontinue at times and places of our choosing\u201d. In issuing the latest US sanctions on Friday, the Treasury said IRGC-affiliated cyber actors recently hacked and posted images on screens of controllers manufactured by an Israeli company, Unitronics. The department said: Unauthorised access to critical infrastructure systems can enable actions that harm the public and cause devastating humanitarian consequences. A State Department spokesperson added that \u201cactors used default credentials to display an anti-Israel message\u201d on the controllers\u2019 interface.

We made these strikes tonight with an idea that there would likely be casualties associated with people inside those facilities.\n\n\n\n9h ago 18.24 EST US will not strike inside Iran, say officials Dan Sabbagh US officials have told CNN that the US had no plan to bomb Iran, which would represent a significant escalation. Administration officials have repeatedly stressed that Washington does not intend to go to war with Iran, despite the accusation that it had armed the groups behind the Tower 22 attack. Iran has also previously warned the US not to launch any direct strike on Iranian territory, saying if the US acts in this way its response will be swift and dramatic. US officials have known for a few days now that the first strikes would happen tonight, the official told CNN. A US defense official told the broadcaster that Air Force B-1 bombers were among the US aircraft that carried out strikes today.\n\n\n\n9h ago 18.15 EST The airstrikes took place over about 30 minutes on Friday, and three of the sites struck were in Iraq and four were in Syria, Lt Gen Douglas Sims, director of the Joint Staff, told reporters. John Kirby, the White House\u2019s national security spokesperson, said the targets \u201cwere carefully selected to avoid civilian casualties and based on clear, irrefutable evidence that they were connected to attacks on US personnel in the region\u201d. The strikes appeared to have stopped short of directly targeting Iran or senior leaders of the Revolutionary Guard Quds Force within its borders.\n\nUpdated at 18.20 EST\n\n9h ago 18.03 EST White House says there will be 'additional responses' after initial strikes Julian Borger John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, said US airstrikes struck three facilities in Iraq and four in Syria. Kirby, speaking to reporters, said the Iraqi government was informed prior to the strikes. He added: These responses began tonight. They\u2019re not going to end tonight. So there will be additional responses. There will be additional action that we will take, all designed to put an end to these attacks and to take away capability by the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp).\n\nUpdated at 18.05 EST\n\n9h ago 18.01 EST Joe Biden has reiterated that the US does not seek conflict in the Middle East as he confirmed that he directed US military forces on Friday to strike targets in Iraq and Syria. Posting to social media, the US president added: To all those who seek to do us harm: We will respond.

Traditionally it has been a chance to connect face to face, to share their anticipation for the forthcoming season but on Wednesday it was the backdrop to Formula One\u2019s most unexpected breakup.\n\nIn the past Wolff\u2019s and Hamilton\u2019s personal meeting over coffee has been so constructive it has been the occasion on which they have thrashed out the broad details of a new contract. This time a contract was on the agenda but it was not one Wolff had anticipated as Hamilton informed him of his intent to leave Mercedes for Ferrari in 2025. The most significant driver move for decades was as unforeseen for Wolff as it was to everyone in F1.\n\nOn Friday, speaking publicly for the first time since the announcement, Wolff admitted he had heard some rumours in the days before but was still surprised when Hamilton informed of his decision, unsurprisingly given the rapidity with which the entire affair appears to have played out.\n\nF1 is used to long, torturously protracted and often tedious contract negotiations, stretching out over months. Hamilton with typical panache appears to have pulled this off almost entirely in secret and with no little alacrity.\n\nReports that he had begun discussions with Ferrari in May of last year have been scotched both by the driver and sources close to him. Indeed Wolff said on Friday he believed that even in late December he felt the pair were going forward together as planned with the new two-year contract they had agreed in August.\n\n\u201cWe were very aligned when we went into the Christmas period,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to ask Lewis why he changed his mind.\u201d\n\nThat crucial detail will have to wait as Hamilton has yet to expand on the decision but what is clear is that it caught Wolff and Mercedes completely off guard. Not least because Ferrari, once involved, were willing to move very quickly and very generously to ensure they secured the seven-time champion, whom they have long wanted to persuade to come to Maranello.\n\nThe Guardian understands the negotiations were exceptionally, unusually swift, with one lawyer citing the contract as the quickest they had dealt with in F1. Ferrari were apparently \u201cexcited\u201d from the moment the two sides began talks and unafraid to make a commitment. Hamilton\u2019s current salary is estimated at around \u00a340m.\n\nView image in fullscreen Lewis Hamilton talks with Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc after the F1 Grand Prix of Mexico in 2023. Photograph: Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty Images\n\nThat figure has been repeated for the new Mercedes deal but sources indicate the Ferrari package is well in excess of this number. All of which suggests that the process could have been concluded in the post-Christmas period.\n\nThe decision to leave the team that has been his home since 2013 and with whom he has scored six drivers\u2019 championships, it seems was the most difficult part for Hamilton. It was a move both brave and bold, to take a chance on a new team, a new challenge with no guarantee of success but once taken it seems Hamilton\u2019s commitment and the Scuderia\u2019s eagerness made the process relatively undemanding.\n\n\u201cOnce they started talking it was very easy,\u201d one source told the Guardian, which seems almost low key and understated for something with such a seismic effect on the sport.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend\u2019s action Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To do it in red would perhaps be the crowning glory.\n\nWolff suggested it was a gamble too. \u201cSwitching to Ferrari, maybe rolling the dice a bit, I can follow that decision,\u201d he said. Which is doubtless true to an extent yet Hamilton was similarly bold in leaving McLaren for Mercedes in 2013, a decision questioned as a reckless gamble at the time.\n\nThen he was a young man, consciously setting out on his own to leave the comfortable environment at McLaren he had enjoyed since he was 13. Now he is as experienced as they come, an old hand at playing the F1 game, acutely sensitive to the machinations involved and of the implications of his actions.\n\nYet despite the years between the two events and how he has grown as character over that time, Hamilton\u2019s modus operandi and motivation appears remarkably similar. McLaren, as with Mercedes, had not expected his departure when he left them for a team he believed had potential and which presented an invigorating new challenge. What played out with Ferrari feels familiar, marked only now by the encroaching years adding an element of urgency to the affair.\n\nWhat does seem clear is that the process, once Hamilton has made his mind up, is as decisive as any of the moves he makes on track. Little wonder then that Wolff and Mercedes were left stunned when the bombshell dropped over breakfast on Wednesday."}

He was a beloved brother, father, grandfather, partner and friend.\u201d\n\nWeathers was best known for playing Apollo Creed alongside Sylvester Stallone in the first four Rocky films. Footage of Weathers was also used in the Creed films led by Michael B Jordan.\n\nAfter becoming a college football star in the 1960s and retiring from a professional career in the early 70s, Weathers began acting in blaxploitation cinema with small roles in Bucktown and Friday Foster.\n\n\u201cI was bitten by the bug, as they say,\u201d Weathers said in 2023. \u201cOn stage having people laugh at the good lines and applaud at the end \u2013 it\u2019s pretty, pretty infectious. Once that bug gets inside you, it\u2019s kind of hard to give it up.\u201d\n\nCarl Weathers' most memorable film and TV roles \u2013 video obituary\n\nHis breakout became in 1976\u2019s Rocky taking on a role initially intended for the real-life boxer Ken Norton. He allegedly got the role after criticising Stallone\u2019s acting in his audition. \u201cSometimes the mistakes are the ones that get you the gig,\u201d he said in 2015.\n\nIn 2020 he said about playing a boxer: \u201cIt was hard to escape taking punches on set. There were times when intentionally we went at each other. I was always concerned that if I hit Sly, threw a punch right, it might hurt. And there was no reason for that. And I think he was pretty much the same way.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Sylvester Stallone and Carl Weathers in Rocky. Photograph: Cinetext/Allstar\n\nWeathers then took roles in the next three Rocky movies, opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1987\u2019s Predator and the lead in 1988\u2019s Action Jackson.\n\nSylvester Stallone described Carl Weathers as \u201can integral part\u201d of his life. On Instagram, Stallone described himself as \u201ctorn up\u201d at the news. \u201cCarl Weathers was such an integral part of my life, my success \u2026 I give him incredible credit,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen he walked into that room and I saw him for the first time, I saw greatness but I didn\u2019t realise how great. I never could have accomplished what we did with Rocky without him. He was absolutely brilliant. Rest in power and keep punching.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Schwarzenegger wrote: \u201cCarl Weathers will always be a legend. An extraordinary athlete, a fantastic actor, and a great person. We couldn\u2019t have made Predator without him. And we certainly wouldn\u2019t have had such a wonderful time making it. Every minute with him \u2014 on set and off \u2014 was pure joy. He was the type of friend who pushes you to be your best just to keep up with him. I\u2019ll miss him, and my thoughts are with his family.\u201d\n\nWeathers acted with Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore and went on to appear in Arrested Development as an acting coach and the voice of Combat Carl in Toy Story 4.\n\n\u201cA true great man,\u201d Sandler wrote on X. \u201cGreat dad. Great actor. Great athlete. So much fun to be around always. Smart as hell. Loyal as hell. Funny as hell. Loved his sons more than anything. What a guy!! Everyone loved him. My wife and I had the best times with him every time we saw him. Love to his entire family and Carl will always be known as a true legend.\u201d\n\nHis most recent roles included Greef Karga in The Mandalorian which scored him an Emmy nomination for outstanding guest actor in a drama series. He also directed two episodes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve loved my time on the show; it has given me an opportunity to be creative in a much more complete way than I had been prior to in other projects,\u201d he said in 2021. \u201cIt has been a great experience, and it couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s creator Jon Favreau said in a statement: \u201cI am heartbroken by this devastating loss. He was a hero from my childhood who I was lucky enough to meet and then had the amazing good fortune to work with. He had the energy and curiosity of a young man paired with the wisdom that his rich life and career afforded him. My heart goes out to his family and countless admirers.\u201d\n\nRobert Rodriguez, who directed episodes of the show featuring Weathers, paid tribute. \u201cWill miss the great Carl Weathers who I was very fortunate to work with on several occasions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA very kind and generous person. His performances were always electrifying and he was also a terrific director of both stage and screen.\u201d\n\nHe is survived by two sons."}

This will be the Chief's sixth Super Bowl appearance and fourth in the past five seasons.\n\nQuarterback Patrick Mahomes did not have his best regular season in 2023 but has been performing well in the postseason. In the NFL playoffs, Mahomes has completed 70% of his passes and thrown 11 touchdowns with no interceptions.\n\nIt's not surprising that the San Francisco 49ers made it to the Super Bowl, given their impressive 12-5 record and overall great regular season. This will mark San Francisco\u2019s eighth appearance in the Super Bowl in franchise history. The 49ers boast a highly efficient quarterback in Brock Purdy, as well as several talented playmakers including Brandon Aiyuk, Deebo Samuel, George Kittle, and Christian McCaffrey. This lineup has set the stage for a must-see title game.\n\nAs of Friday and a little over a week until the big game, here are the predictions for Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nNFL:Nickelodeon's broadcast of Super Bowl 2024 will include SpongeBob SquarePants performance\n\n2024 Super Bowl predictions for San Francisco 49ers vs. Kansas City Chiefs\n\nBetMGM: Chiefs to win their third Super Bowl in five years\n\nStaff writes: \"For the entire season, the 49ers are 25th in rush EPA per play allowed and 27th in rushing success rate allowed. Even since acquiring Chase Young in Week 10, they\u2019re 19th in rush EPA per play allowed and 23rd in rush success rate allowed. Although the Chiefs managed only 2.8 yards per attempt on the ground in Baltimore, they thrived in earlier postseason games. Against the Bills and Dolphins, who finished the regular season 17th and 16th in rush defense DVOA, they averaged 6.1 and 4.3 yards per rush, respectively. Given the 49ers ranked 15th in rush defense DVOA during the regular season, expect Kansas City to dominate on the ground. Lastly, Patrick Mahomes is 11-1-1 ATS as an underdog for his career, and postseason underdogs that move by at least half a point are 69.2% ATS. For those reasons, take the Chiefs to win their third Super Bowl in five years.\"\n\nESPN: 49ers have a 59% chance to win\n\nAccording to the ESPN Matchup Predictor, the San Francisco 49ers have a 59.4% chance of beating the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nSporting News: Chiefs 30, 49ers 24\n\nBill Bender writes: \"Kansas City has allowed more than 24 points in one game this season, and that defense might make the difference in the fourth quarter one more time. If the Chiefs need a score with the game on the line late, then can you trust Mahomes? San Francisco allowed 26 points per game in the playoffs. This will be a 27-24 game either way, and our guess is Mahomes finds a way to win a third Super Bowl.\"\n\nNew York Post: 49ers\n\nSean Treppedi writes: \"Brock Purdy continues to be unvalidated for irrelevant reasons, such as his draft position, yet he continues to extract the best from the talent around him while taking plays into his own hands when needed. Isn\u2019t that the textbook description of a successful quarterback? Either that or a league-leading 72.7 QBR and a 113.3 passer rating. We love to get caught up in narratives, and there is certainly plenty to discuss with two perennial contenders for the better part of a decade. But when it comes down to what\u2019s on the field, let\u2019s call it square on two top-three defenses in points allowed. I see this as the unrelenting chemistry between Mahomes and Travis Kelce \u2014 who connected on all 11 attempts against Baltimore \u2014 against an overwhelming cast of star power. Mahomes\u2019 connection with Kelce has accounted for more than 36 percent of his air yardage in the playoffs. Calling him a one-trick pony would be ignorant, but the 49ers are deploying four players with 100-plus total yards in the playoffs. They more than doubled the Chiefs in average scoring margin. Whether Vegas perceives Mahomes as an underdog or not, the public will always favor him at this point. Ignore the storylines and take the early edge with San Francisco.\"\n\nBleacher Report: Chiefs 27, 49ers 21\n\nStaff writes: \"The game between the Chiefs and 49ers will be a rematch of Super Bowl LIV, when Kansas City won 31-20. Kansas City came into Sunday's AFC Championship Game as an underdog, but Mahomes said the Chiefs \"never feel like underdogs.\" As far as the odds are concerned, though, they will be underdogs once again against the 49ers in the Super Bowl. Compared to the last three Chiefs teams that reached the Super Bowl, this one didn't dominate throughout the regular season and faced plenty of doubt heading into the postseason. Kansas City proved this year, however, that any team coached by Andy Reid and led by Mahomes has a fighting chance. San Francisco came into the season hungry for a Super Bowl, and the 49ers have looked like one of the top teams in football all year. Led by star running back Christian McCaffrey and promising quarterback Brock Purdy, the 49ers certainly have what it takes to keep up with Kansas City's electric offense. With a powerful offense and a more than capable defense, the 49ers will look to avenge the Super Bowl loss from 2019. However, with the way Mahomes has played this postseason, the Chiefs will be tough to beat.\"\n\nSan Francisco 49ers vs. Kansas City Chiefs Chiefs odds, spread and lines for Super Bowl LVIII\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers are favorites to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII according to the BetMGM NFL odds.

This year, parents and experts alike expressed concern over the \"tripledemic\" expected to rage through the winter months, as RSV, COVID-19 and the flu all came out to play along with the typical common cold.\n\nExisting health conditions play a major role in how seriously any of these illnesses impact you, and the highest levels of concern are generally reserved for people with weaker immune systems to fight off sickness - namely, people with autoimmune conditions, older people and children.\n\nAs a result, this flu season, like most others, has been particularly hard on children. News of influenza-related pediatric deaths periodically make headlines, but experts say there is no need to panic; instead, just be vigilant and careful.\n\nFlu season can be concerning for any parent or caregiver, but there are plenty of resources for ensuring your child gets proper care and stays safe this season and those to come.\n\n2023-2024 flu season for kids\n\nPediatric infectious disease specialist Dr. Kris Bryant told USA TODAY that this flu season has been more or less normal as far as pediatric cases. Bryant, who is a specialist at Norton Children's Hospital in Lousiville Kentucky and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said a usual or \"typical\" season still entails a lot of people getting sick.\n\n\"So far, this seems like the typical flu season that we saw prior to the pandemic,\" she said. \"Recognize that a 'typical flu season' results in a lot of outpatient healthcare visits and hospitalizations and even some deaths in children.\"\n\nAccording to the most recent CDC data, there were 10 influenza-related pediatric deaths in the week ending Jan. 20, bringing the total to 57 thus far for the 2023-2024 flu season. The \"season\" as categorized by the CDC, runs from late fall to early spring, and 106 total pediatric deaths were reported to the CDC by February of the 2022-2023 season, the highest number since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"In the decade before the pandemic, the number of pediatric flu deaths ranged from 37 in the 2011-12 season to 199 in the 2019-20 season,\" Bryant told USA TODAY. \"The final total for last season was 183 deaths. That\u2019s a scary number for both parents and pediatricians.\"\n\nAccording to the CDC report, 103 of the 106 children who died by February of last year were eligible for vacation and vaccination status was known for 81 of those. Of those children, 90% were not fully vaccinated against the flu. The CDC has been keeping track of pediatric flu deaths since 2004 but says the real number of cases is likely significantly underreported.\n\nHow to protect your kids from the flu\n\nWhat to know about Paxlovid:Paxlovid is a potential lifesaver. So why aren't more people taking it?\n\nOne of the first and most important steps for protecting your child from the flu is to vaccinate them against it, say experts.\n\n\"Vaccination is effective at preventing the most severe complication of flu,\" said Bryant. \"In some years, we see flu cases throughout the spring. It is not too late to receive a flu shot.\"\n\nMost children over the age of six months are eligible for their flu shots, which are especially important for kids under the age of five, the CDC says. Young children are more likely to develop serious symptoms and complications that require hospitalization, but vaccination reduces the severity and length of illnesses and decreases the rate of death and hospitalization.\n\nBryant said that some kids are more at risk for developing severe, complicated influenza, including those younger than 5 years of age and especially children younger than 2 and/or kids who have chronic medical conditions. That said, she doesn't want parents to think that because their child is otherwise healthy or older, they don't have to worry about the flu, as it can cause complications for any child.\n\n\"Last year, 65 of the first 106 pediatric flu deaths reported in the U.S. occurred in children 5 to 17 years of age. Typically, about half of pediatric flu deaths occur in children without underlying medical conditions,\" said Bryant. \"It can be really difficult to know which child will become really sick from flu, which is one reason that flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months and older.\"\n\nParents and caregivers of children too young to receive a flu shot should be immunized themselves, Bryant said. Keeping flu out of your home and immediate circle can also be a useful practice for keeping your kids healthy: she suggests minimizing contact with other people who are sick and practicing good handwashing and hygiene.\n\nWhat to watch out for if your child catches the flu\n\nAntibiotics and how they work:How do antibiotics work, what happens to your body when you take them? We've got answers\n\nBetween school, family, friends, siblings and extracurricular activities, even the most careful of families may end up battling unwanted flu infections. With the common cold, COVID-19, RSV and multiple strains of the same illnesses all floating around at the same time, it can be difficult to determine if your young family members are suffering from the flu or something else.\n\nAccording to the CDC, some signs to watch out for, especially in children under 5, are:\n\nA fever, which is is a temperature greater than or equal to 100 degrees Fahrenheit in kids (37.8 degrees Celsius).\n\nOther physical symptoms of fever, such as skin that feels warm to the touch, a flushed appearance, sweating or shivering.\n\nBody aches.\n\nFatigue.\n\nHeadache.\n\nSore throat and/or cough.\n\nCongestion or runny nose.\n\nStomach upset and/or vomiting.\n\nDiscerning when infants and toddlers feel sick can be a little trickier, as they have fewer means to communicate their needs and feelings to us. Some additional signs to look out for specifically in babies and very young children include:\n\nIrritability and frequent crying.\n\nTrouble feeding or refusal to feed.\n\nTrouble sleeping.\n\nFlu can also result in the worsening of underlying medical conditions and that can land some kids in the hospital, according to Bryant.\n\n\"In terms of how flu makes kids really sick, some who develop severe influenza have an overwhelming viral infection,\" she said. \"Other kids with flu may develop a secondary bacterial pneumonia or sepsis In prior flu seasons, I have taken care of kids who developed severe infections due to Staph or Strep germs shortly after they were diagnosed with flu.\"\n\nIt is always best to consult with a medical professional first and foremost, especially if you have any concerns or doubts. However, there are some warning signs that a more serious illness requiring immediate medical care and potentially hospitalization is developing. These include:\n\nA high fever that persists for days.\n\nFever above 104\u00b0F.\n\nTrouble breathing or unusually rapid breathing, pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips or nail beds.\n\nChest pain or severe muscle pain.\n\nChanges in level of consciousness: being unresponsive or hard to rouse, not being alert or interactive when awake.\n\nSigns of dehydration, including: dark urine, dry lips, sunken eyes, pale hands and feet, no tears when crying, no wet diapers or peeing for eight hours.\n\nSymptoms such as fever or cough that seem to improve but then return.\n\nSevere headache and/or neck stiffness.\n\nContinuous vomiting and/or inability to consume and keep down ample amounts of food and liquid.\n\nWorsening chronic medical conditions, such as asthma.\n\nIn children less than 12 weeks, any fever.\n\nTips for treating the flu at home\n\n\"The goal is for every child with flu is to be seen before they develop severe or life-threatening flu symptoms,\" said Bryant, who advises connecting with your pediatrician when your child becomes sick, regardless of apparent severity.\n\n\"Antiviral medications are available and recommended for children at the highest risk of complications from flu. They are most effective if started early in the course of illness,\" she advised.\n\nThere are other things you can do at home to help manage symptoms and keep your younger family members comfortable, as well. As usual, all treatments should be evaluated for age appropriateness and run by your pediatrician before use.\n\nSome tips to try out at home include:"}

You (and every version of you) may have a \"canon event.\"\n\nThe release of \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" in June 2023 brought forth a conversation about these so-called \"canon events\" and how changing them (or getting rid of them entirely) could alter someone's life.\n\nMaybe you've heard someone use the term \"canon event\" and weren't quite sure what it meant. We'll explain.\n\nWhat is a canon event?\n\nThe term \"canon event\" derives from the 2023 movie sequel \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.\" In short, a canon event is something that shapes a person and defines who they are.\n\nThe concept blew up on social media following the movie's release. On apps, like TikTok, some videos would be captioned, \"can't interfere, it's a canon event.\"\n\nIn the film, Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is the Spider-Man of Brooklyn, New York, on Earth-1610. He reunites with Spider-Woman Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), whom he befriended in the series' first installment \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\"\n\nStacy, alongside several other Spider-Man variants, is tasked with addressing anomalies that are occurring across the multiverse, or Spider-Verse. The Spider-Verse contains every timeline of every Spider-Man variant and their subsequent stories.\n\nMorales decides to follow Stacy to help. Instead of making things better, Morales only causes more problems by stopping a \"canon event\" in the timeline of Pavitr Prabhakar, another Spider-Man variant from India (Karan Soni).\n\nMiguel O'Hara, Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Issac), explains that canon events are what connect all the Spider-Man variants throughout the Spider-Verse. \"Miles, you disrupted a canon event,\" he says.\n\nSpider-Man has certain events that parallel one another throughout his infinite timelines, such as a spider bite and the death of a loved one. Without these canon events, said Spider-Man variant couldn't exist and the Spider-Verse would fall apart.\n\nWhile canon events may keep the Spider-Verse intact, they have also connected people in the real world \u2013 regardless of someone's location or identity \u2013 based upon a mutual, formative event.\n\nFollowing the film, users on social media began labeling certain instances in their lives as \"canon events.\" Examples include having an \"emo phase\" in middle school or experiencing your first \"situationship\" breakup.\n\nOne TikTok user posted, \"I'm told it's a canon event to bring a Lululemon lunch bag to your first day of middle school,\" gaining around 486.6 thousand likes.\n\nAnother Tiktok user shared a video of their younger cousins showing their family a dance they made up with the caption, \"it's a canon event.\"\n\nJust Curious for more?

She had options ahead of her. She could thread the needle to a teammate. She could drive to the basket herself. Or \u2026 she could take a transition 3.\n\nIn what has become common for Iowa\u2019s superstar, Clark pulled up about a foot beyond the arc. It was nothing but net.\n\nInside Northwestern\u2019s Welsh-Ryan Arena Wednesday night, the raucous Hawkeye fans erupted. Little kids wearing Clark jerseys screamed in excitement. If not for the purple logo at center court, one might mistake this for an Iowa home game.\n\nClark\u2019s signature long-range shots wow coaches, players and fans across America, and will likely do so Saturday, when Clark and No. 4 Iowa travel to Maryland. But the logo 3s were once a source of contention between the reigning National Player of the Year and her coaches.\n\n\u201cThere were some shots that she took in high school that only one of us thought were good shots,\u201d said Kristin Meyer, Clark\u2019s coach at Dowling Catholic High in Des Moines.\n\nIn college, Clark is a statistical anomaly. After her 35-point performance Wednesday night in Iowa\u2019s 110-74 win over Northwestern \u2014 in which she broke Kelsey Mitchell\u2019s Big Ten scoring record \u2014 the senior is just 104 points away from breaking the women\u2019s all-time NCAA scoring record (3,527 points), set by Kelsey Plum in 2017.\n\nHOW CLOSE IS CLARK:Iowa's Caitlin Clark chases NCAA scoring title\n\nClark shoots 40.1% from 3 this season, and 38.3% for her college career. While the leaders in women\u2019s Division-I this season shoot around 50% from long-distance, Clark has taken nearly 200 more 3s than many of those players.\n\nAnd she\u2019s not just taking 3s, she\u2019s taking deep 3s. According to CBB Analytics, Clark shoots 39.2% on shots that are 25-30 feet from the rim (in college, the 3-point line is 22 feet, 1 3/4 inches). These are what CBB Analytics call \u201cLong Distance 3s.\u201d Others call them \u201clogo shots.\u201d The D-I average from this range is 29.5%, meaning that Clark shoots the (really) long ball 9.8% better than the national average.\n\nFor these reasons, the talk about Clark almost always focuses solely on her scoring ability, even though she\u2019s widely considered the best passer in college basketball too, and also leads the nation in that statistical category.\n\nThis poses a potential problem for coaches, especially at the high school level. Players trying to get recruited could try to differentiate themselves with a Clark-like range \u2014 even if they haven\u2019t put in the reps like Clark.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t see it necessarily as training or work,\u201d said Meyer, her high school coach. \u201cShe does it because she loves it.\u201d\n\nDespite a few meetings between Meyer and Clark about better shot selection, Clark had the confidence and work ethic to improve, Meyer said. Between her freshman and sophomore seasons at Dowling Catholic, Clark went from averaging 15.3 points to 27.1. Once Meyer realized that the deep 3s were just a part of Clark\u2019s game, she encouraged Clark to take them.\n\nConfidence is encouraged, but logo 3s aren't\n\nPutting in the work is one thing. Actually gaining Clark-range is another. Girls basketball coaches around the country trust their players, but maybe not to shoot logo 3s.\n\n\u201cI think her work-ethic is 100% unicorn-like,\u201d Christina Raiti, head coach of Long Island Lutheran, the No. 2 high school team in the nation according to MaxPreps.com, said of Clark.\n\nOne of the talented players Raiti coaches is guard Syla Swords, a five-star recruit who has verbally committed to Michigan. Raiti says that Swords has earned the right to shoot deep 3s, but even she has a limit.\n\n\u201cMaybe no logo 3s,\u201d Raiti said. \u201cThat would be a little crazy. She might have to sit down for a little bit.\u201d\n\nSwords herself thinks Clark is changing the perception of what is a good shot among coaches and younger players. It could encourage other players to shoot farther back.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen someone like her before in the women\u2019s game,\u201d Swords said.\n\nAlicia Komaki, coach at No. 6 Sierra Canyon, echoed this sentiment. While shooting from 25 feet may be a terrible shot for the majority of players, it\u2019s not for Clark.\n\n\u201cCaitlin\u2019s numbers have proven that she\u2019s able to shoot that shot like she can shoot a layup,\u201d Komaki said. \u201cYou can\u2019t argue that it\u2019s not a good shot for Steph Curry and not a good shot for her.\u201d\n\nHigh school coaches say Caitlin Clark is 'an energy-giver'\n\nClark\u2019s range might be unicorn-like, but there are other aspects of her game that coaches seek to instill in their players.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an energy-giver, which is something we talk a lot about. But she\u2019s also elevating the people who are playing with her and making them better basketball players,\u201d Raiti said.\n\nClark\u2019s mentality is another point of emphasis for high school coaches.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s willing to take the big shot and so we applaud the level of confidence in which she approaches the game with. We also talk about this idea that she puts the work in. That just doesn\u2019t happen by accident,\u201d said Sue Phillips of top-ranked Archbishop Mitty, who has coached players like three-time WNBA All-Star guard Danielle Robinson.\n\nWhile Philips doesn\u2019t exactly condone her players shooting from the logo, she does think that Clark is a perfect example of someone who has extended her range to improve herself and her team.\n\n\u201cThat heat-check is encouraged sometimes,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cYou encourage a kid to continue to test their limits to determine where that range is where you can consistently hit the 3.\u201d\n\nScoring is undoubtedly important, but some coaches think it should be emphasized less by the media \u2014 especially when it comes to Clark.\n\n\u201c[The media] sends a message to the kids that you\u2019re only recognized for your ability to score the basketball,\u201d said Tamika Dudley, coach of No. 5 Sidwell Friends in Washington D.C., where five-star recruit and UCLA commit Kendall Dudley plays.\n\nLike many coaches, Dudley doesn\u2019t want her players to just be scorers. She also wants them to be good passers with the desire to improve and confidence to take the big shot \u2014 much like Clark.\n\nClark, her numbers and her style of play, are already impacting the next generation of basketball players, even if emulating her game is a lofty goal. But her impact is felt off the court, too \u2014 and some think that might be even more impressive.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing a tremendous amount of work to pave the way for women\u2019s sports,\u201d Raiti said. \u201cHow can you not be a fan?\u201d\n\nEverett Munez is a graduate student at Northwestern University\u2019s Medill School of Journalism."}

What a kerfuffle", "domain": "usatoday.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMI7D-wowkqT0Ag", "text": "The entire Joel Embiid situation is unfortunate.\n\nThat\u2019s the best word for it.\n\nUnfortunate that Embiid, the Philadelphia 76ers star, is injured, first and foremost.\n\nUnfortunate that Embiid\u2019s injury puts him in the middle of a controversy surrounding a new rule tying games played to eligibility for regular-season awards and honors such as MVP and All-NBA.\n\nUnfortunate that Embiid was slammed with over-the-top hot takes when he didn\u2019t play against Denver because of a legitimate injury as opposed to him \u201cducking\u201d Nuggets star Nikola Jokic.\n\nUnfortunate that injuries have been conflated with load management \u2013 sitting out with an injury is not the same as taking a game off for no good reason.\n\nThe NBA knew this would happen, a situation where an All-Star caliber player would be ineligible for a major award because he didn\u2019t play in at least 65 of 82 games.\n\nNo one could\u2019ve predicted it would happen so soon in the first season with the new rule in place, adopted by the league and players in the 2023 collective bargaining agreement.\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating topic with tight curves and steep slopes \u2013 and a slew of opinions.\n\nEmbiid, the 2022-23 MVP, is having another dominant season, averaging a career-high 35.3 points and 5.7 assists. He also can be counted on for 11.3 rebounds, 1.8 blocks and 1.1 steals and shoots 53.3% from the field, 36.6% on 3-pointers and 88.3% on free throws.\n\nEven before his latest injury \u2013 a meniscus issue in his left knee sustained Tuesday against Golden State \u2013 Embiid was headed for a potential season with less than 65 games played. He has missed 13 games and will miss Saturday\u2019s against Brooklyn as the team, Embiid and knee specialists determine the best treatment plan. He\u2019s sure to miss even more.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to envision Embiid playing 65 games and being a part of the MVP conversation the rest of the season.\n\nWhy did the NBA and players implement this rule? Was it necessary to tie games played to awards and honors? Why was 65 the magic number?\n\nThe league has made a dedicated effort to get its best players on the court for as many games as possible, including the implementation of a Player Participation Policy which encourages teams to play healthy star players or risk a fine. The NBA is an entertainment business, too, and paying customers (fans, TV partners, sponsors) want to see the best product possible. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\n\nSince the league can\u2019t fine a player \u2013 just the team \u2013 when he misses a game, the NBA wanted an incentive for players. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a minimum games played required for those awards and honors.\n\nFor the most part, the media has policed games played in relation to awards throughout the years. Bill Walton has the fewest games played for any MVP at 58 games in 1977-78, but that\u2019s when players voted for MVP. Since 1980-81, media has voted for MVP.\n\nMore:Why Joel Embiid's astounding stats might not be enough for him to win NBA MVP\n\nWhen Embiid won the award last season and played in 66 games, it was the fewest games played for an MVP since 1980-81. Allen Iverson is the next MVP with the fewest games played in a season at 71 in 2000-2001. Every other MVP since 1980-81 has played in at least 72 games.\n\nBut this gives the media a hard line. There\u2019s no arbitrary number from one voter to the next. For example, some people didn\u2019t vote for LeBron James as an All-NBA selection last season because they didn\u2019t think he played in enough games (55). But other voters did, and he made the team. Now, there's no confusion on what it takes to be considered.\n\nBut why 65 games? That\u2019s essentially 80% of games (79.268% to be exact), and it is reasonable to think a player should play in 80% of games to be MVP or All-NBA. Could it have been 60 or 62 games? Sure. But the league and players settled on 65, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a movement, at least right now, for revisiting that number.\n\nThis may impact a small percentage of players but it has an outsized importance based on those involved, especially when you include Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton who is having an All-NBA season. He averages 23.0 points and a league-best 12.3 assists while shooting 49.2% from the field and 39.5% on 3-pointers.\n\nIn the offseason, Haliburton signed a five-year, $205.9 million designated max extension, but if he were to make All-NBA this season, the amount would grow to $246 million. Because of a hamstring injury, he has missed 13 games. The stakes are significant.\n\nThere\u2019s not much recourse for Embiid or Haliburton. There is a grievance process, but those are aimed at extraordinary circumstances which force a player to miss games (birth, death) or a team possibly limiting minutes and games played in an effort to suppress a player\u2019s chances to earn a higher salary.\n\nEmbiid, who has an extensive injury history and has played in 65 or more games just twice in seven seasons, wants to play and win. He has said his goal is to win an NBA title, and the Sixers are just 4-9 without him this season. He knows they need him on the court.\n\nAnd his desire to be on the court \u2013 for a variety of reasons \u2013 when perhaps he should have been sidelined led to an injury.\n\nAnd an unfortunate situation all the way around.\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on social media @JeffZillgitt"}

This is the fourth installment of the series.\n\nYou may have heard about the destruction of a bronze Jackie Robinson statue in Kansas. The statue honored the man who broke baseball's color barrier and one day, it simply went missing, cut from the top of the shoes.\n\nThe removal of the statue would generate national headlines and immense outrage. Part of the reason why was because of the affront to what Robinson represented. There aren't many respected symbols of overcoming and persistence more recognizable than Robinson. There's also the fact that League 42, named after Robinson\u2019s Dodgers number, paid about $50,000 for it, and the statue was placed in a park, where hundreds of kids play in a youth baseball league.\n\nThere's an ugliness and brazenness to what happened. The news would get even worse. The Wichita fire department found the statue burned to ashes not long after it was stolen. It was totally destroyed.\n\nWhat happened? Was it a prank that went too far? Was it an act of racism? We don't know yet.\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\n\u201cIf it turns out it was racially motivated, then obviously that is a deeper societal issue and it certainly would make this a much more concerning theft,\u201d said Bob Lutz, the executive director of the league nonprofit that commissioned the sculpture. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see what this turns out to be.\u201d\n\nBut this is what we do know. The destruction of the statue led to a rallying cry that was united and loud. Everyone came together to decry the destruction of the statue.\n\nLutz said MLB and its individual clubs would help replace the statue. There's also a GoFundMe that's raised hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nIn a country divided there was unity over the statue of Robinson.\n\nBob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"You can steal the statue but you can\u2019t steal the spirit of what the statue represents! Disheartening end to the stolen Jackie Robinson statue has generated a Robinson-like resolve from the public for good to overcome evil!\"\n\nThis story is brutal and ugly but in many ways it embodies Robinson perfectly. There was a resoluteness to Robinson and his legend, and this symbol of that legend, has the same unwavering effect.\n\nThere's something else that was stunning to see. The support for League 42 was resounding and appeared to come from people all across the country.\n\nThere are some things, a few things, which can unite us all and this was one of them. That's the good part to come from this ugly moment."}

Do you favor the biggest stars? Those who shone brightest on Super Sunday? The ones with sustained levels of excellence?\n\nWhile undertaking this fool's errand, I weighed each consideration, attempting to also make it representative of all positions rather than skew too heavily toward quarterbacks or offensive players who more easily show up in the box score (and MVP log).\n\nWith that prologue in mind, here's my list of the 58 greatest players in Super Bowl history as we head into Super Bowl 58 between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers:\n\n1. QB Tom Brady\n\nThe longtime New England Patriots star, who was also crowned with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, has more rings (7) than any other franchise and more Super Bowl MVPs (5) than any other player. His record 10 Super Bowl starts have allowed him to become the game's all-time leader in pass attempts (421), completions (277), yards (3,039) and TDs (21). Brady aired it out for a Super Sunday record 505 yards in the Super Bowl 52 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2017 season, breaking his mark of 466 set the previous year. But his Super Bowl 51 effort may be the most impressive given he orchestrated the greatest comeback in the game's history, leading the Super Bowl's lone overtime drive against the Atlanta Falcons after digging out of a 25-point hole. The storybook ending seemed to come three years ago, when he and the Bucs proved way too much for Super Bowl 54 MVP Patrick Mahomes and the defending champion Chiefs ... even if TB12 added a two-season epilogue.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\n2. QB Joe Montana\n\nHe's been overtaken in several categories by Brady, who grew up idolizing the man who set the gold standard for Super Bowl quarterback play. Montana went 4-0 on Super Sunday with the 49ers, was named MVP thrice and had 11 TD passes with nary an interception, which explains his remarkable record for passer rating (127.8). And who can forget the methodical, 92-yard TD drive he led \u2013 capped by the game-winning throw to John Taylor in the final minute \u2013 to win Super Bowl 23?\n\n3. WR Jerry Rice\n\nAs you'd expect of the original \"GOAT,\" he's in a class by himself. He owns Super Bowl career records for receptions (33), receiving yards (589) and TDs (8). No one else save Rob Gronkowski (5) has more than three TD catches, a total Rice matched in Super Bowl 29. His single-game record of 215 receiving yards made him Super Bowl 23's MVP.\n\n4. QB Terry Bradshaw\n\nHe'll always have his detractors. But it was Bradshaw, not the Pittsburgh Steelers' famed Steel Curtain, who showed the way to victory in Super Bowls 13 and 14, taking MVP honors in both games. He was the first quarterback with four Lombardi Trophies, and his nine TD strikes trail only Brady and Montana. And what about the toughness factor? Bradshaw threw the game-winning touchdown in Super Bowl 10 while taking a helmet to the jaw that literally knocked him out.\n\n5. OLB/DE Charles Haley\n\nCount 'em, five Super Bowl rings (two with the 49ers, three with the Dallas Cowboys) \u2013 a figure exceeded only by Brady. Since sacks became official in 1982, Haley's 4\u00bd are tied for the most in the Super Bowl record book. He bagged Cincinnati Bengals QB Boomer Esiason twice in Super Bowl 23, the Niners' narrowest Super Sunday win.\n\n6. QB Doug Williams\n\nHe only played on Super Sunday once. But all the Washington star did was prove to any remaining naysayers that a Black quarterback could win it all \u2026 while doing it on a hyperextended knee \u2026 while throwing four TD passes in an unreal 35-point second quarter ... on his way to MVP honors in Super Bowl 22.\n\n7. RB Emmitt Smith\n\nThe Super Bowl 28 MVP was the Cowboys' closer that night (132 yards, 2 second-half TDs) and again in Super Bowl 30. Smith's five rushing TDs are a record, and his 289 rushing yards rank third.\n\n8. QB Eli Manning\n\nThis is not a suggestion that he's better than big brother Peyton. But Eli is definitely more deserving of a spot on this list given his heroics in twice winning Super Bowl MVP honors for the New York Giants with some truly miraculous plays in upsets of the Patriots.\n\n9. RB Terrell Davis\n\nIn what was arguably the greatest Super Bowl effort by a tailback, he ran for 157 yards and a record-tying three TDs \u2013 while combating a migraine \u2013 on his way to Super Bowl 32 MVP honors as the Denver Broncos won their first title. Davis added 102 rushing yards and 50 more receiving when Denver repeated the next year.\n\n10. QB Joe Namath\n\nHe was more game manager than gunslinger on Super Sunday and didn't throw a touchdown in the New York Jets' monumental upset of the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl 3. But Broadway Joe was still that contest's MVP, wisely calling for effective gainers from his backs, taking what was available when passing, all while delivering on his epic pregame guarantee and changing the course of pro football history by vanquishing the NFL establishment \u2013 which had already agreed to absorb the American Football League.\n\n11. K Adam Vinatieri\n\nHis 34 Super Bowl points trail only Rice's 48. None were bigger than the pair of game-winning field goals Vinatieri drilled for the Patriots to end Super Bowls 36 and 38. He snagged a fourth ring with the Indianapolis Colts in 2006.\n\n12. QB Bart Starr\n\nThe numbers won't wow you \u2013 452 passing yards and three TDs combined over the course of two games \u2013 but the steady hand of the Green Bay Packers great also clutched the first two Super Bowl MVPs as a capstone to a legendary dynasty.\n\n13. WR Lynn Swann\n\nHe basically built a Hall of Fame career over four Super Sundays. Three of his four catches (totaling 161 yards) in Super Bowl 10 were of the acrobatic variety, including the game-deciding 64-yard TD in the fourth quarter, which is why Swann was the MVP. His 364 career receiving yards are tied with Gronkowski for second most after Rice.\n\n14. QB Steve Young\n\nHis six TD passes in the Niners' Super Bowl 29 victory remain a single-game Super Bowl record. And don't forget, Young collected two more rings as Montana's backup.\n\n15. QB Patrick Mahomes\n\nYes, he's awesome. But what a checkered Super Bowl r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Mahomes, 28, is about to become the first quarterback to start four times on Super Sunday before his 30th birthday. Heading into Super Bowl 58, he's already won the game twice and come away with the MVP trophy both times. Yet he's also thrown four INTs (against 5 TDs), played heroically (but poorly) behind a tattered line versus Brady's Bucs in Super Bowl 55 and wasn't the best quarterback on the field last year. His SB QB rating is 79.7.\n\n16. MLB Jack Lambert\n\nThe vampire-toothed man in the middle racked up 46 tackles during Pittsburgh\u2019s four victories and famously chucked Cowboys S Cliff Harris after he taunted Steelers K Roy Gerela in Super Bowl 10.\n\n17. QB Kurt Warner\n\nWith a break here and there, he'd have three championships instead of one. But credit Warner for leading the long woebegone Rams and Cardinals out of the wilderness. And not only did the Super Bowl 34 MVP set a then-record with 414 passing yards, his 377 yards in Super Bowl 43 and 365 in Super Bowl 36 gave him the three most prolific passing days in the game's history until Brady's explosions in Super Bowls 51 and 52.\n\n18. RB Franco Harris\n\nA four-time champion, nearly half of his career record 354 rushing yards came when the Super Bowl 9 MVP posted a since-broken standard of 158 en route to Pittsburgh's first title. Harris' four rushing scores trail only Smith, and his 468 yards from scrimmage are second to Rice (604).\n\n19. MLB Ray Lewis\n\nHe was the villain of the week prior to the game, but Lewis emerged as Super Bowl 35's MVP after the dominant 2000 Baltimore Ravens defense shut out the Giants offense. Twelve years later, Lewis collected more bling in his final ride.\n\n20. DE L.C. Greenwood\n\nHis four sacks of Dallas QB Roger Staubach in Super Bowl 10 represent an unofficial record since the NFL didn't officially recognize sacks until 1982. Same goes for the five career sacks by Greenwood, who started all four of Pittsburgh's victorious Super Sundays in the 1970s.\n\n21. RB Roger Craig\n\nThe Niners' main man in the backfield, he earned three rings as one of the original do-it-all backs. Craig piled up 410 yards from scrimmage, good for third place in the Super Bowl record book, and scored four TDs.\n\n22. TE Rob Gronkowski\n\nNo tight end has truly taken over a Super Bowl, but Gronk came pretty close against the Eagles, finishing with nine receptions, 116 yards and a pair of scores in a losing effort. His impact in New England's Super Bowl 49 victory went beyond six catches for 68 yards and a TD as he thoroughly occupied the attention of the Seahawks. In Super Bowl 53, his 29-yard reception on a badly bruised thigh set up the game's only touchdown (a 2-yard run by Sony Michel) on the following play. Despite playing on a bum ankle that would require surgery, Gronkowski nearly corralled what would have been a game-winning Hail Mary on the final play of Super Bowl 46. Finally, the four-time champ scored the Bucs' first two TDs against K.C. in Super Bowl 55, and Tampa Bay never looked back. Gronk's five career TDs, 29 receptions and 364 receiving yards are bested only by Rice.\n\n23. OLB Von Miller\n\nA rare defender who won the game's MVP, Miller was picked as the guy from the vaunted 2015 Broncos defense to take the hardware home after registering 2\u00bd sacks and two forced fumbles in Super Bowl 50. He scored another ring with the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl 56, adding a pair of sacks, which allowed him to catch Haley for the Super Sunday lead.\n\n24. OLB Ted Hendricks\n\nHe's usually remembered as a Raider, but the first of Hendricks' four Super Bowl wins came with the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl 5. None of the defenses he played on surrendered more than 14 points.\n\n25. WR John Stallworth\n\nLike Swann, his Steelers wingman, he has three Super Bowl TD grabs, two covering more than 70 yards. Stallworth's 73-yard TD from Bradshaw in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl 14 broke the backs of the plucky LA Rams.\n\n26. RB Larry Csonka\n\nThe workhorse for the Miami Dolphins, including the 17-0 1972 team, his 297 rushing yards in three games are second only to Harris. Csonka scored twice and had a then-record 145 yards to net Super Bowl 8 MVP honors and had 112 yards the previous year when Miami capped its perfect season.\n\n27. WR Julian Edelman\n\nHe owns three rings after his 10-catch, 141-yard showing in Super Bowl 53 earned him the MVP trophy. Two years earlier, Edelman's epic shoestring scoop of a Brady pass that was deflected by Falcons CB Robert Alford helped spark New England's historic comeback. The Super Bowl 52 loss to Philadelphia might have had a different outcome had Edelman not been sidelined by a knee injury. His 337 Super Bowl receiving yards trail only Rice, Gronkowski and Swann.\n\n28. QB Phil Simms\n\nHe threw 25 passes in Super Bowl 21, and only three hit the ground. Pretty high bar as the MVP led the Giants to the first of their four Lombardi Trophies.\n\n29. QB Troy Aikman\n\nHe captained the '90s Cowboys to three titles and was named MVP for the first one in Super Bowl 27 after throwing for 273 yards and four TDs. Aikman's 70% completion rate in his three appearances makes him the most accurate Super Sunday passer.\n\n30. S Jake Scott\n\nHis pair of interceptions, including the game-clincher, put a bow on the Dolphins' perfect season and brought him Super Bowl 7's MVP. Scott got another ring the following year, recovering a pair of Minnesota Vikings fumbles. He also handled kickoff and punt returns for Miami.\n\n31. TE Travis Kelce\n\nIn three Super Bowls, he's racked up 22 grabs for 257 yards with a pair of scores \u2013 most ever among tight ends not named Gronkowski. But Kelce's meter is still running ...\n\n32. OLB Rod Martin\n\nThe only man to pick off three passes in one Super Bowl \u2013 Martin thrice victimized the Eagles' Ron Jaworski in Super Bowl 15 \u2013 he got one ring when the Raiders were in Oakland and another after they moved to LA.\n\n33. DT Joe Greene\n\nNo one embodies the Steel Curtain Steelers more than Mean Joe, who started all four Super Bowls in the 1970s.\n\n34. WR Deion Branch\n\nHe's best remembered as MVP of the Patriots' Super Bowl 39 triumph, when he posted a then record-tying 11 catches for 133 yards. But Branch may have been even better the previous year against the Carolina Panthers, when he snatched 10 Brady passes for 143 yards and a TD.\n\n35. DT Aaron Donald\n\nPerhaps the greatest interior D-lineman ever, he anchored a Rams defense that allowed only 13 points in Super Bowl 53, albeit in a losing effort. Three years later, Donald notched a pair of second-half sacks of Bengals QB Joe Burrow and pressured him on Cincinnati's final snap as Los Angeles came back to win 23-20.\n\n36. CB Malcolm Butler\n\nHe was an undrafted rookie no-name when he made arguably the clutchest of all Super Bowl plays by undercutting Seattle Seahawks WR Ricardo Lockette's route at the goal line to intercept Russell Wilson's pass and turn what seemed near-certain defeat into the Patriots' fourth title. Butler will never be a no-name the rest of his life \u2026 though he did garner unwanted attention for essentially being benched by Bill Belichick in Super Bowl 52, a decision that seemed to backfire.\n\n37. OLB Chuck Howley\n\nHe's the only man to win the MVP award despite playing for the losing side when the Cowboys fell in Super Bowl 5. Howley, who established the Super Bowl career record with three INTs, won a ring the following year.\n\n38. DT Manny Fernandez\n\nHe had a remarkable 17 tackles and one sack \u2013 unofficial totals \u2013 in the Dolphins' Super Bowl 7 win and almost certainly should have been named the MVP.\n\n39. CB Ty Law\n\nHis 47-yard pick-six off Warner in Super Bowl 36 helped chart the course for New England's dynastic run. Law wound up winning three championships with the Patriots.\n\n40. DT Justin Tuck\n\nHis contributions typically get overshadowed in the Giants' dual victories over New England. But Tuck was Brady's personal nemesis, sacking him twice in each game.\n\n41. G Gene Upshaw\n\nThe Oakland Raiders stalwart played in three Super Bowls, each in a different decade. In Super Bowls 11 and 15, he teamed with fellow Hall of Famer Art Shell \u2013 they formed probably the best left side of any O-line in history \u2013 to embarrass both the Vikings' famed Purple People Eaters and Eagles defense as the Silver and Black won their first two titles.\n\n42. CB Mel Blount\n\nThe Steelers' super-sized corner collected a pair of Super Bowl picks and four rings.\n\n43. CB Deion Sanders\n\nThe original shutdown corner went back-to-back with the 49ers and Cowboys in Super Bowls 29 and 30, respectively. Sanders picked off a pass for San Francisco, and the Steelers\u2019 unwillingness to test him the following year was a big reason MVP Larry Brown snagged two INTs. However Sanders did make an impact on offense, catching a 47-yard pass from Aikman.\n\n44. DE Richard Dent\n\nOne of the few D-linemen honored as the game's MVP, Dent was picked as the guy from the vaunted '85 Bears defense to take the hardware home after registering 1\u00bd sacks and two forced fumbles in Super Bowl 20.\n\n45. DB Ronnie Lott\n\nThe tone-setting defender of the 49ers' great teams started at both cornerback and safety on his way to four championships.\n\n46. DE Reggie White\n\nMaybe the greatest defensive end ever, he set the official Super Bowl record with three sacks of Patriots QB Drew Bledsoe in the Packers' Super Bowl 31 victory.\n\n47. T Joe Jacoby\n\nHe was one of only two Hogs to start on the offensive line in all three of Washington's Super Bowl wins. RBs John Riggins (166 rushing yards in Super Bowl 17) and Timmy Smith (204 yards in Super Bowl 22) both had record days running behind Jacoby and Co.\n\n48. OLB Mike Vrabel\n\nA consummate Patriot, he played in four Super Bowls and wound up with three rings. He also racked up 16 tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble \u2026 and two TDs on two receptions while lining up as a tight end in goal-line packages. Not bad.\n\n49. OLB James Harrison\n\nHe picked up a pair of Lombardis in three trips with the Steelers. He also left his imprint with an unforgettable 100-yard INT return off a Warner misfire \u2013 producing at least a 10-point swing \u2013 in Pittsburgh's 27-23 victory over the Cardinals in Super Bowl 43.\n\n50. C Mike Webster\n\nAnother four-time Steelers champ, he was a tough-as-nails throwback who also handled long-snapping duties.\n\n51. RB James White\n\nCompelling case to be made that he, not Brady, should have been Super Bowl 51's MVP. White set single-game records with 14 receptions and 20 points (he scored 3 TDs and a key 2-point conversion in New England\u2019s comeback). His 2-yard TD run in overtime provided the winning margin against the Falcons. He added another 66 yards from scrimmage and a TD against Philadelphia the next year.\n\n52. QB Jalen Hurts\n\nHe outplayed Mahomes in Philly's Super Bowl 57 loss, passing for 304 yards and a TD ... while rushing for 70 yards (most by a quarterback on Super Sunday) and three more scores, tying Davis' mark. A two-point conversion also allowed Hurts to match White's 20 personal points. About the only blemish was the fumble Hurts lost that Chiefs LB Nick Bolton returned 36 yards for a TD.\n\n53. WR Max McGee\n\nLove this guy. After a long night of partying on the eve of the first Super Bowl \u2013 McGee thought he'd be warming the pine for the Packers \u2013 he stepped in for injured Boyd Dowler and scored again. Despite being less than 100%, McGee caught seven passes for 138 yards and two scores, one a behind-the-back snare.\n\n54. OLB Lawrence Taylor\n\nHe never tallied a Super sack, but we're not leaving the two-time champion and greatest pass-rushing linebacker ever off the all-time team.\n\n55. CB Dwight Smith\n\nHe had a pair of pick-sixes (covering 94 yards) in the Bucs' Super Bowl 37 beatdown of the Raiders.\n\n56. KR/WR Jacoby Jones\n\nHe gets the nod over Super Bowl 31 MVP Desmond Howard as our return ace. Jones had a strong case to be the Ravens' Super Bowl 47 MVP after posting a single-game record 290 all-purpose yards, which included a record 108-yard TD on the opening kickoff of the second half. And that was after he ended the first half with his only catch of the game \u2013 a 56-yard TD.\n\n57. OL Randy Cross\n\nHad to give the linemen a little more love. Cross was a Pro Bowl guard for the 49ers' first two title teams and moved to center for their third Super Bowl win, which happened to be his final game.\n\n58. LB Mike Jones\n\nA journeyman who would have receded into NFL anonymity had he not seized his Super Bowl moment by making a game-ending, title-saving tackle of Tennessee Titans WR Kevin Dyson just shy of the goal-line (and a potential game-tying TD) in the St. Louis Rams' only Super Bowl victory.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on X, formerly Twitter @ByNateDavis."}

It comes with historical context, underscoring the significance of one Black athlete after another. It amplifies, with powerful eloquence that is quintessential Edwards, struggles and evolution of the civil rights movement. And the renowned activist doesn't hesitate to tell you that it is hardly finished business.\n\nTypically, Edwards, a longtime consultant for the San Francisco 49ers and once the most popular professor at Cal-Berkeley, uses personal experiences to illuminate messages. During the late 1960s, while earning his Ph.D. from Cornell, he organized the Olympic Project for Human Rights, which produced the raised-fist protest by Tommie Smith and John Carlos on the medal stand during the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.\n\nHe rolled with the Black Panthers and was under surveillance by the FBI, with J. Edgar Hoover personally overseeing his case. He can drop so many names, and so casually, of people he has more than merely encountered on his journey: Maya Angelou. Martin Luther King. Jim Brown. Bill Walsh. Bill Russell. Colin Kaepernick.\n\nThere are so many places that Edwards can take us on a continuum of enlightenment.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nYet as Edwards, 81, reflected for more than two hours at 49ers headquarters earlier this season, this particular lesson included a theme for which he is not famous: life and death.\n\n'Stuck a screwdriver in a bone and started twisting'\n\nEdwards was diagnosed during the spring of 2022 with myeloma, a cancer that develops in the bone marrow and threatens to spread throughout the body. Without a cure and determined to reject various forms of treatment, he has battled excruciating pain for months.\n\n\"If you sit here and watch me get up out of this chair, you'll wonder why I even bother,\" Edwards told USA TODAY Sports. \"I'm almost living on quick-release, maximum-strength Tylenol every two, three hours. Pain in my bones, clavicles, hips, spine, my back.\n\n\"It's far enough down the road where I know I have to be careful getting up, because sometimes I go to stand up and one side, or both sides, from my hips down, just disappear like they evaporated, like I'm falling. And that's a big problem with this condition.\n\n\"So it's something that I'm aware of, and I just have to roll with it. To manage it, I'm sometimes eating Tylenol like it's popcorn. But that's what it takes, and it doesn't dull my faculties. I've talked to a number of doctors; there's stuff that I could take to ameliorate the pain, treatments that might slow the pace ... but there are side effects. There is no cure.\n\n\"But one thing after the pace is slowed and it's even halted, when it comes back, it comes back with a vengeance. So there's that dimension. The pain is really bad news. I don't know if it's the 80 years or the myeloma. But it feels like somebody stuck a screwdriver in a bone and started twisting.\"\n\nAt first glance, Edwards looks as imposing as he was during the early 1990s, when I met him while working for The Marin (County) Independent-Journal as a 49ers beat writer. He's a well-built 6 feet, 8 inches (which is one reason why two NFL teams and an NBA team in the early 1960s dangled tryout options, which he shunned to pursue a career in academics), and despite his illness, has kept his weight on. The thought of cancer weakening his body is not easy to decipher. He has always seemed so powerful, with a booming voice and incisive wit that matched his physique.\n\nIn mid-January, Edwards received good news after undergoing another battery of tests. Doctors told him there has been no increase in myeloma markers since his previous round of extensive tests in May. He realizes the disease is unpredictable, that it is possible he can remain stable for 10 years ... or suffer a setback that rapidly progresses.\n\nAs of late Thursday, Edwards wasn't sure whether he would attend Super Bowl 58. He said doctors have ruled out air travel due to the potential for developing blood clots, leaving the possibility of driving to Las Vegas. He is content with the notion of watching on the 105-inch screen at his East Bay home, yet will leave the final decision to his wife of 54 years, Sandra Boze.\n\nStanding on the sideline Sunday during pregame warmups for the NFC title game at Levi's Stadium, he said Boze was moved as she stood with him during an on-the-field tribute from the 49ers before the NFC divisional playoff game. The 49ers honored Edwards for his lifelong commitment to social justice and education. It would not surprise Edwards if Boze wants to be on hand at Allegiant Stadium.\n\nRegardless, he insists he will not stress over his condition.\n\n\"You know what? Like I've said before, I did not expect to live to be 30,\" said Edwards, who grew up in East St. Louis, Illinois. \"People were dying all around me. I think about 39 years old, Malcolm X. Dr. King, 39. Some of the young people who were in the movement with me, and the Black Panther Party, 20, 21. Fred Hampton was 21. When I was out there, I was 24.\n\n\"To live to be 81 years old, man, what do I have to be whining about?\"\n\nNo, it is Edwards' style at whatever age to carry on with purpose. Despite this adversity, that spirit hasn't waned.\n\n\"What I look at is how much can I get done with whatever amount of time I have left,\" Edwards said. \"To do some things that will amount to a contribution. And the rest of it, you know what? I look at it like my (three) children, my two grandsons, my former students, athletes here that I know and have talked to \u2013 like K.T. (Keena Turner), Ronnie (Lott), Joe (Montana), Roger Craig \u2013 all of these people are also watching.\n\n\"They need to know that even this stage of life can be handled with dignity, grace and even a sense of humor.\"\n\nHe mentions that when he decided to pursue a career in academia, he signed up for life. And that includes now.\n\n\"I can still be teaching on my deathbed,\" Edwards said. \"And if that's the case, I've made a contribution. Even in this context.\"\n\nIt's about contribution, not legacy\n\nIt was striking to hear this icon of social activism express desire to make more contributions. Is he kidding? Throughout his life, Edwards has been such a major-impact player, so to speak. He created an entirely new academic discipline linking sports and society. Over several decades, he has been the preeminent voice for the plight of Black athletes. Yet this is arguably Edwards' great gift continuing to operate.\n\nIn recent months, Edwards completed two important projects he feels will make lasting contributions: a 12-part video series, \"The Last Lectures,\" that covers the history of activism over a span of more than 150 years; and a six-part documentary, \"The Struggle and the Power,\" with a similar theme intersecting sports, race and activism. While talks for the distribution of the projects are ongoing, Edwards is also aiming to complete a documentary on Joe Frazier and has narrated a three-hour oral history on sports activism.\n\n\"At some point, I'm going to sit down,\" he said.\n\nWhy has he been so busy? Is Edwards driven to cement his legacy?\n\n\"Legacy is something that somebody else is going to write,\" he fires back. \"Because I won't be here. I don't concern myself with things that I'm never going to be able to experience. What I'm interested in, in terms of these pieces, is not legacy. I'm interested in contribution. I want to make sure that people will look back on these films, along with a scholar-athlete life, and say, 'I learned something.'\n\n\"Somebody asked me how I would assess the contributions of Jim Brown, Bill Russell, Elgin Baylor and Arthur Ashe. I said I always ask one question, and one question only: Did they make a contribution? That's the key question. Not legacy.\n\n\"Legacies can be phony-ed up. Legacies can depend on who's writing the book. Contributions depend on what you actually do. Not what somebody said about you. What did you actually do? So that's where I come down on that.\"\n\nThis reminds Edwards of something that fellow activist H. Rap Brown told him that he has found to be true. Brown said only the people and the struggle survive.\n\n\"Individuals never survive and very, very few are truly ever remembered,\" Edwards said. \"We have a tendency, and social media has made it even worse, to reduce people to characters. To reduce them to sound bites.\n\n\"I mean, Malcolm X is, 'By any means necessary.' Dr. King is, 'I have a dream.' Rap Brown is, 'Burn, baby, burn.' Stokely Carmichael is, 'Black Power.' But when you ask what contributions they made, you have to go much deeper.\"\n\nLifelong educator also taught life lessons\n\nEdwards has been reminded in recent months of some of his contributions, as word about his condition spread. He's heard from hundreds of his former students at Cal-Berkeley and San Jose State, expressing appreciation for the impact he's had on their lives.\n\n\"That's what a teacher really lives for,\" he said. \"For a student to say, 'You made a difference. You changed the way I looked at the world.' That's what really matters to me.\"\n\nHaving picked Edwards' brain dozens of times over the years, for formal interviews, background perspective or just during general conversation, I can imagine what it would have been like to have been one of his college students, exploring sports and society. That would have been lit, as the kids say today. When I told him that, he laughed.\n\n\"Don't feel bad about not going to Cal and taking my class,\" he said. \"You probably wouldn't have been able to get into my class. They would have an enrollment for 550 and 1,100 people would show up. And they would stick around, even after the deadline for enrolling, hoping that somebody would drop the class, that they'd be able to just go and get a seat one day.\"\n\nEdwards recalled being told by a fellow sociology professor there was a problem. Edwards would attract roughly 700 students for his classes, while other classes in the same window would have fewer than 20 students, he explained.\n\n\"They tried moving my class to lunchtime,\" he remembered. \"Didn't make a difference. They tried 4-5 p.m., dinner time. Same thing. There would be 600 to 700 students in my class.\"\n\nWhen Walsh brought Edwards to the 49ers in 1985, a large part of the purpose was to teach players life lessons. \"What I had to say, Bill realized that he didn't have the time nor capacity to teach,\" Edwards said.\n\nIt was a different setting in one sense -- Walsh told him his office was \"the building\" and \"the locker room\" -- yet completely familiar territory for a man who to this day is the only captain of two teams (basketball, track and field) at San Jose State. He connects.\n\nI saw it during the early '90s, when the talented team included the likes of Jerry Rice, Tom Rathman, Harris Barton and Jesse Sapolu. And I saw it recently, too, walking with Edwards at the 49ers compound after players had just bolted from a meeting. George Kittle waved and spoke. Deebo Samuel stopped, served up a bro-hug and engaged in quick chit-chat with Edwards. The respect was palpable.\n\nKeena Turner, who played his entire 11-year NFL career as a 49ers linebacker from 1980-90, is Edwards' point man with the 49ers these days. A vice president and senior adviser to GM John Lynch, Turner has been in the team's front office for 27 years.\n\n\"He can go anywhere he wants to in the building,\" Turner told USA TODAY Sports. \"We just want to know he's here.\"\n\nDuring an exchange with Turner in the parking lot, Edwards couldn't contain his excitement about Brock Purdy, the young quarterback who has emerged since being the last player drafted in 2022. Edwards is so impressed that he maintains Purdy could become one of the greatest 49ers ever -- which is a mouthful when considering legends including Montana, Lott, Rice and Steve Young.\n\nOPINION:Stop picking on 49ers' QB Brock Purdy\n\nTurner stopped him.\n\n\"That's a statement to be made in hindsight,\" Turner told Edwards. \"You taught me that.\"\n\nWith that, Edwards let out a hearty bellow.\n\n'Harry, don't get my daughter killed'\n\nThere is no shortage of compelling reflections from Edwards. Why did he come to California in the first place? Edwards wanted to play football at USC.\n\n\"I had read about this college coach at USC who had named a Jewish kid, Ron Mix, and a Black kid, Willie Wood, co-captains of the team,\" Edwards said. \"He got much blowback. Threats. His response was to name them co-captains again the next year. So I said, that's where I wanted to go.\"\n\nThe coach was Al Davis, who coordinated the Trojans' offense from 1957-59. USC arranged for Edwards to begin with a year at a feeder school, Fresno City College. After one semester (and with a national junior college record in the discus), he transferred to San Jose State \u2013 which is where his academic career took off.\n\nWhen Edwards wound up at Cornell as a prestigious Woodrow Wilson fellow, he was told that on average, it took 8 1/2 years to earn a doctorate degree. He proceeded to finish his classwork in two years, took two years off as he delved into the Olympic protest project, then wrote a 1,105-page dissertation he said is the longest in Cornell history. That morphed into an integrated textbook, \"The Sociology of Sport.\" He earned his Ph.D. in five years.\n\n\"They thought I was a big, dumb ex-jock looking for an easy way out,\" he said.\n\nAnother vivid memory was the day he met Boze's family during the latter half of the 1960s in Los Angeles. By then, as the 1968 Olympics approached, Edwards had a very high profile as an activist.\n\n\"She came home with a big Afro, big earrings, and her folks said, 'Wait a minute,' \" Edwards recalled.\n\nBoze introduced Edwards and revealed their plans to marry. She wanted her parents' blessing.\n\nHer father flatly told Edwards: \"Harry, don't get my daughter killed.\"\n\n\"What he was really telling me was, 'If you get my daughter killed, I'm coming for you,' \" Edwards reflected. \"And he was a non-violent guy, a schoolteacher.\"\n\n\"No sir, I'm not going to do that,\" Edwards replied.\n\nEdwards and Boze have endured for well over a half-century, facing a series of private challenges on top of the public issues Edwards is known for.\n\n\"You know who my real source of courage, vision and insight is for this? My wife,\" Edwards said. \"Double mastectomy. Melanoma. High blood pressure. And she has never stopped smiling. Never stopped laughing. The same lady for 54 years. And she's handled it. I wish I had the level of courage that she has.\"\n\nEdwards believes that the situations where he supported his wife with her health challenges helped prepare him to manage his current condition. Undoubtedly, that works both ways.\n\n\"She worries too much about me,\" he said. \"But that's her make-up. This nurturer who wants to take care of this.\"\n\nThe key to everything\n\nThe 49ers have provided more teaching moments. And reflections. Edwards sees the dynamic between coach Kyle Shanahan and Lynch, and it reminds him of how Walsh interacted with his GM, John McVay. He thinks Walsh would be proud of the culture that is seemingly well-established with the current team.\n\n\"One of the things Bill Walsh said when asked about the greatest characteristic of his best teams was that they cared and respected each other,\" said Edwards, who delivered the eulogy at Walsh's funeral in 2007.\n\n\"And when I look at this team and I see what Fred Warner thinks about (Nick) Bosa, and what Bosa thinks about Trent Williams, and what Christian McCaffrey thinks about Purdy, and what Purdy thinks about (Brandon) Aiyuk, (Jauan) Jennings and Deebo, and the way they interact and how they embrace each other's challenges, it reminds me of Joe and Steve, and Jerry and John Taylor. It reminds me of Tom Rathman and Roger Craig ...\n\n\"Not because of the winning and productivity, because they didn't always win. But they were always together on it.\"\n\nEdwards sees society at large when he ponders the 49ers, past and present. Society, he insists, can heed lessons that include honoring diversity.\n\n\"This team, there's a magic to them because they care about each other,\" he said. \"That is the key to everything. I think sports recapitulates society. The key to dealing with almost every major problem we have in this country \u2013 the economy, the divisions between us, the international posture of the United States \u2013 it's going to have to begin with the simple fact that we care about each other on a very human level. And if we don't do that, we're doomed.\"\n\nAnd that's a lesson for the ages."}

And there's other key matchups across the country worth keeping an eye on. So with February here and the cold weather of winter still giving you reason to stay inside, it's the perfect time to grab your remote and catch up on all that has been happening the past three months.\n\nWhere do you get started? We break down all the big matchups below so you can plan your day and hopefully there will be some nail-biters and buzzer-beaters to keep things interesting.\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\nThe Cougars had a rough start in their first taste of Big 12 road play but have since rebounded to lead the league with their usual defensive approach that puts them No. 1 in fewest points allowed. This might be their hardest test away from home, however the Jayhawks have recently hit a bit of a slump with a pair of losses in their last four. Hunter Dickinson and Kevin McCullar give Kansas two big scoring options. More will be needed from the rest of the starters and backups, though, because Houston has its own two-headed threat with L.J. Cryer and Jamal Shead.\n\nThe Tar Heels appeared to be peaking ahead of this matchup before their 10-game winning streak was broken by Georgia Tech. They'll be looking to get back into the groove against their biggest rival. It's been an up-and-down season so far for the young the Blue Devils, who appear to be rounding into form and getting healthier, after some disappointing losses. The emotions are sure to be high in Chapel Hill and hopefully the game will match the expectations.\n\nBRACKETOLOGY: North Carolina barely holding on to top seed\n\nIt's been a rough week for both the Volunteers and Wildcats, who both lost on their home court and slipped further behind first-place Alabama in the SEC title race. Tennessee has been getting a scoring jolt from Dalton Knecht, who is averaging more than 30 points in his last six games. Kentucky has the firepower to keep up, but needs to improve on the defensive end to avoid a fourth league loss.\n\nThe Cyclones have been one of the surprise teams of the season and are only a half game off the Big 12 lead after wins against Houston and Kansas. The Bears got a big road victory at Central Florida after three consecutive losses, two of which were in overtime and the other by two points. Can their offense led by freshman standout Ja'Kobe Walter overcome the stingy defense of the Cyclones or will they drop further off the pace of the conference leaders?\n\nLast March\u2019s national runner-up squares off against the current Mountain West leader. Both the Aztecs and Aggies are comfortably in the field at this point, but another quality win will improve one of the team's already strong profile with the committee. Utah State hasn't missed a beat with Danny Sprinkle in his first season as coach, helped by the scoring of Great Osobor (19.1 ppg), a transfer Sprinkle brought in from Montana State. San Diego State relies on the inside presence of Jaedon LeDee (20.5 ppg).\n\nIn a role reversal, it's Saint Mary's that leads the West Coast Conference standings and Gonzaga that is contemplating life on the bubble.

In response, DeSanctis felt compelled to take on the role of caretaker within the dream, ensuring that her loved one felt safe as they confronted their inevitable fate.\n\nAs she reflected on the dream later, she came to a somber realization: The \"loved one\" in her dream wasn't a family member or friend, but was rather a symbol for herself and the meaningful journey she's been on since January 2022.\n\nFor the past two years, DeSanctis, a 40-year-old native of Farmington, Maine, has been on a trek across the United States on the American Discovery Trail. And as she approaches the Pacific Coast of California, she finds herself mourning, in a way, the impending end of an adventure that has quite literally taken her from one end of the country to the other \u2013 and that may help her make history.\n\nThe American Discovery Trail Society is not aware of another woman who has completed the journey solo, the group's President Eric Seaborg told USA TODAY.\n\n\"This life, the one I\u2019ve been living for two years, this life of freedom in the midst of struggle, is almost finished,\" DeSanctis wrote on Jan. 20 in a column for the Daily Bulldog, the Maine news outlet where she has regularly documented her hike. \"This life of mine is coming to an end. I feel like a part of me is dying. I\u2019m simultaneously the guardian of my being; my welfare, happiness and stability.\"\n\nA reflection of solitude, welcoming arms\n\nDeSanctis' two-year expedition has been one of solitude as she completes a solo hike that began Jan. 1, 2022 on the Atlantic shores of Cape Henlopen, Delaware. But those long solitary stretches have also been punctuated by meaningful encounters with Americans from all walks of life who have offered food, water and even a warm place to stay for the night to a traveling stranger.\n\nAs she nears the end of an extraordinary 6,800 mile hike across 15 states and Washington D.C., DeSanctis told USA TODAY that it'll be those memories that will stick with her the most when she integrates back into a regular life.\n\n\u201cEveryone that you meet takes you in and shows you a little part of their world,\u201d DeSanctis said in a recent phone interview as she approached Rio Vista, CA. \u201cEverybody that I've met has been really amazing.\u201d\n\nDeSanctis plans to walk into the waters of the Pacific Ocean on Feb. 10, signaling the official completion of the trail at its western terminus.\n\nWhat is the American Discovery Trail?\n\nWhen DeSanctis decided to tackle the American Discovery Trail, she was working in a metal shop in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It had been seven years since she completed the more famous \u2013 and arguably less daunting \u2013 Appalachian Trail, and the lifelong outdoorsman decided she was in need of a new challenge.\n\n\u201cI wanted to have a more solitary experience,\u201d DeSanctis said. \u201cWhen you are by yourself, you\u2019re 'by yourself.' There aren\u2019t always hikers around and the people you do meet don\u2019t really understand what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nOne of the longest trails in the nation, the ADT stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in Delaware to Point Reyes National Seashore in California. Along the way, adventurers come across an array of habitats and terrains \u2013 from its highest point at over 13,000 feet in the Colorado Rockies, to mountains separated by arid valleys in Nevada.\n\nA blend of backcountry wilderness and urban environments, the trail also wends through forests, grasslands and greenways.\n\nAnd when DeSanctis says she is completing the ADT, she is really hiking the entire trail. The ADT splits into northern and southern trails Ohio and unifies again in Colorado, so along her journey, she flew back to Ohio to hike the other trail, too.\n\n'Nothing short of amazing'\n\nThough she scrimped and saved before setting out on the trail, DeSanctis, a journalist and public speaker, said she has also worked odd jobs along her trek to help pay her way when she has found herself in need of food and supplies.\n\nPraising the mental toughness that DeSanctis displayed to complete such an arduous hike on her own, Seaborg of the American Discovery Trail Society lauded her as \u201cnothing short of amazing.\u201d\n\n\"She\u2019s been a wonderful and inspiring ambassador for the trail,\" Seaborg told USA TODAY, adding that DeSanctis took the time to speak remotely from the trail during one of the organization's membership meetings. \"It\u2019s hard to think of the superlatives to capture her accomplishment \u2013 breath-taking, incredible.\"\n\nA church shelter and making lifelong friends\n\nDays spent hiking through isolated, remote areas and nights spent camping alone in her tent beneath the stars have largely defined DeSanctis' coast-to-coast hike.\n\nBut she's also had occasion to regularly rely on the generosity and friendship of others.\n\nWhen not camping on her own in the wilderness, DeSanctis has found herself sleeping in garages, backyards and even spare bedrooms thanks to the hospitality of many people she met along her journey. She acknowledged that she didn't have much to offer them in return, save for tales of her adventures and her genuine gratitude.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made so many lifelong friends along my travels,\" DeSanctis said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking for positive experiences and you\u2019re not afraid, they\u2019re going to find you.\"\n\nEarly into her hike, she said she came across a pastor and his wife in West Virginia who offered her shelter and respite from the January cold at their church down the road. Volunteers with the American Discovery Trail have also offered their support along the way when needed, Seaborg said.\n\nWhile hiking through snowy Nevada late last year, DeSanctis was approached by a couple in a vehicle who saw her tracks in the snow and followed them to ensure no one was in distress. The couple, who introduced themselves as Duane and Andrea Carnahan, offered DeSanctis some water and even a place to stay for a few days before she headed out again on the trail.\n\nThe three of them bonded, and though the Carnahans are already legally married, they extended an invitation to DeSanctis to attend their wedding ceremony in August.\n\n\"Our bond with Briana was almost like we were all long time friends that had been separated by distance,\" Duane told USA TODAY. \"She is like family to us.\"\n\nWhat's next for Briana DeSanctis?\n\nThe Carnahans are just two of the people with whom DeSanctis hopes to reconnect when she completes her cross-country trek.\n\nAfter more than two years in the wilderness, she said she's not eager to settle back down right away, either. A steady job and a permanent place to call home aren't necessarily in DeSanctis' immediate future if she can manage it.\n\nWhen she completes her journey, she instead hopes to do some public speaking to share her story in hopes of inspiring others, particularly young women and girls, to do difficult things. DeSanctis said she's also working on a memoir about her adventure.\n\nAnd of course, she has a lot more hiking ahead of her.\n\n\u201cI can always hike more, there\u2019s always another trail out there,\u201d DeSanctis said. \u201cIt's such a freeing experience; you take in a lot more, you see a lot more than if you were just driving by.\"\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Gruner, 64, formed the support group in 2019 after three Latinos ages 17 to 22 died by suicide here over a two-week period.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t wait for research,\u201d said Gruner, founder of the Coalici\u00f3n de L\u00edderes Latinos. \u201cWe wanted to do something about it.\u201d\n\nThat said, the data is already coming in. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s provisional numbers for 2022 show a record high of nearly 50,000 suicide deaths for all racial and ethnic groups.\n\nGrim statistics from KFF show that the rise has been more pronounced among communities of color. From 2011 to 2021, the suicide rate among Hispanics jumped from 5.7 to 7.9 per 100,000 people.\n\nFor Hispanic children 12 and younger, the rate increased 92.3% from 2010 to 2019, according to a study published in the Journal of Community Health. Ser Familia, a social services organization in metro Atlanta, said it has seen alarming numbers of Hispanic children who report having suicidal thoughts.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem seen coast to coast, in both urban and rural communities.\n\nStress piles up on young people\n\nMental health experts said there are many social and economic pressures on minority groups. For Hispanics, who may be of any race, cultural and systemic obstacles may also be at play.\n\nImmigrant children are often expected to take more responsibility when their parents don\u2019t speak English. Many live in poorer households with family members who don\u2019t have legal residency. And cultural barriers and language may prevent many from seeking care in a mental health system that already has spotty access.\n\n\u201cOur kids are interpreters, they pay bills, go to medical appointments,\u201d increasing their stress and anxiety, said Belisa Urbina, CEO of Ser Familia.\n\nThe Latino Community Fund Georgia also pinpoints stress linked to immigration worries. A study of Latino adolescents ages 11 to 16 found the detention or deportation of a family member was associated with significantly higher odds of suicidal thoughts.\n\n\u201cThere are waves of immigrants coming as minors, displaced and sometimes not with immediate caregivers,\u201d said Diane Elias, vice president of behavioral health at the Children's Institute in Los Angeles. \u201cThis can put hefty burden on children. They are expected, as minors, to balance self-financing and earning money to support family or help them immigrate to the U.S.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, mental illness can also be culturally taboo.\n\nObstacles and solutions\n\nLanguage remains a significant barrier. In July, the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline added a text and chat service in Spanish, but a spokesperson for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration acknowledged more work needs to be done to reach communities at risk.\n\n\u201cWe have a tremendous need for bilingual mental health providers in Georgia,\u201d said Pierluigi Mancini, CEO of the Multicultural Development Institute.\n\nGruner is aware of only three bilingual providers in her area \u2013 a county that is more than one-third Hispanic.\n\nDidi Hirsch Mental Health Services in Los Angeles offers a Spanish-language suicide helpline. \u201cWhen we answer the calls in Spanish, you can hear that relief on the other end,\u201d said program coordinator Alejandra Vargas. \u201cThat, \u2018Yes, they\u2019re going to understand me.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd bias can add another obstacle. Nirmita Panchal, a senior policy analyst for KFF, said mental health symptoms of children of color \u201cmay be mistakenly characterized as disruptive behaviors.\u201d\n\nA recent Rand Corp. study used secret shoppers to schedule mental health appointments in California. About 1 in 5 Spanish-language calls ended with the scheduler hanging up or informing the caller that no one was available to assist in Spanish.\n\nAcross the country, mental health professionals, researchers and Hispanic leaders point to several ways to reduce suicide.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial that more funding goes toward mental health generally, including prevention programs that recognize cultural, legal and language needs, said Jagdish Khubchandani, a professor at New Mexico State University.\n\nFor now, some local leaders are filling gaps by doing community work, such as Gruner and her support group.\n\nMiguel Serricchio of Santa Clarita, California, facilitates bilingual support groups for people whose lives have been rocked by suicide. His son, Alex, took his own life in 2016.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get the word out,\u201d Serricchio said.\n\nThis article was produced by KFF Health News, which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.

He faces no serious opposition and has a history with South Carolina voters, who are credited with injecting momentum into his struggling campaign four years ago.\n\nThough the outcome isn\u2019t in question, the primary could give clues to where Biden stands with the party\u2019s base. How well he energizes Black voters in South Carolina could forecast how he might fare elsewhere and what more he has to do to win over key supporters.\n\nWhen is the primary in South Carolina?A guide to the Republican and Democratic elections.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWhy is South Carolina going first?\n\nSouth Carolina is the first of many primaries in what is expected to be a brutal presidential rematch this November against former President Donald Trump, a Republican.\n\nSouth Carolina doesn\u2019t usually go first. That honor of first-in-the-nation primary has traditionally been bestowed upon New Hampshire.\n\nBut national Democrats decided to move up South Carolina\u2019s primary this year and make it the nation\u2019s first official contest. Part of the reason is South Carolina has a diverse population. Black people make up nearly 30% of the state\u2019s population while New Hampshire is nearly 93% white.\n\nNew Hampshire, however, objected to changing the primary calendar and scheduled its contest earlier than allowed. National Democrats said that violated the rules, so Biden didn\u2019t appear on the ballot there. Not that it mattered. New Hampshire Democrats waged a write-in campaign on his behalf, and he ended up easily winning that primary on Jan. 23.\n\nBut even though New Hampshire Democrats went first, South Carolina is the first officially sanctioned primary of this year\u2019s presidential contest.\n\nMore:What's the difference between a caucus and a primary election? Here's how each works.\n\nHow did Joe Biden fare in South Carolina in 2020?\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign was struggling when he marched into South Carolina four years ago. He had placed fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary. Before the polls in New Hampshire even closed, he decided to bail out on a planned campaign party and flew off to South Carolina, which his team believed could be the firewall that would turn their fortunes around.\n\nIt was a smart move.\n\nBiden easily won South Carolina, carrying all 46 of the state\u2019s counties and claiming 61% of the state\u2019s Black vote, which was pivotal to his victory. Biden\u2019s win in South Carolina gave him momentum heading into the Super Tuesday elections three days later. He would go on to capture the Democratic nomination and defeat incumbent Trump in the general election the following November.\n\nBiden leads other candidates in South Carolina primary\n\nPresident Joe Biden is looking to place first in South Carolina, and an Emerson College poll shows the winds are in his favor.\n\nThe poll conducted between Jan. 2 and Jan. 3 found that sixty-nine percent of Democratic primary voters plan to support Biden, while 5% support Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., and 3% support Marianne Williamson. Twenty-two percent of Democratic primary voters are undecided.\n\n\u201cBiden holds a strong base of support among South Carolina Democrats, no alternative presents any challenge for the president,\u201d Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said. \u201cThe 22% still on the sidelines present an opportunity for Biden to begin his 2024 primary elections with a strong showing to open for the Democratic nomination.\"\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is the 2024 Democratic primary?A state-by-state guide to the election schedule\n\nHow is Biden doing among Black voters this time?\n\nThis year, polls, including one from USA TODAY, show some Black voters aren\u2019t as excited about a Biden bid. Some young voters of color are upset Biden hasn\u2019t called for a cease-fire in the Israeli/Hamas war, in which thousands of Palestinians have been killed or injured.\n\nIn a Pew Research Center survey released in mid-January, nearly half of Black voters approved of Biden\u2019s job performance and about the same number disapproved.\n\nOne of Biden\u2019s key supporters, Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., is tamping down expectations for high Black voter turnout this year. Four years ago the Democratic field was more crowded, there was a global pandemic and the country was engulfed in social unrest.\n\n\u201cThe lay of the land is a little bit different (now),\" said Clyburn, one of the highest-ranking African Americans in Congress.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Biden reelection campaign are working overtime to turn out Black voters in the uncompetitive primary. Biden has visited the state twice this year; Vice President Kamala Harris has visited three times since the beginning of January. First lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff have also campaigned there.\n\nMore:When is the Nevada primary election and the caucus? What to know about the dual contests.\n\nWho else is running?\n\nBesides Biden, the other Democrats on the ballot are Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota and Marianne Williamson, an author and spiritual leader\n\nPhillips received about 20% of the vote in New Hampshire, while Williamson got about 4%. Williamson was part of the crowded 2020 field that included Biden, but she dropped out before the first contests.\n\nNeither poses a serious threat to Biden this year.\n\nSouth Carolina has an open primary election\n\nSouth Carolina has an open primary, which is a primary election where voters do not have to have a political party affiliation to vote for partisan candidates.\n\nThe South Carolina Election Commission states on its website that \u201cYou can pick either primary but you can only vote in one.\u201d\n\nVoters must have registered by Jan. 4 to participate in the Democratic primary.

And experts say swarms of bugs can cause understandable stress for many people, especially as billions or trillions of the creatures emerge from the ground.\n\nKatherine Brownlowe, a psychiatrist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said cicadas can evoke anxieties, particularly for people with sensory overload sensitivities, a phobia of cicadas or an anxiety disorder for a few reasons.\n\n\"There is kind of a discomfort or disgust feeling that's common for most humans around most bugs, Brownlowe said. \"The discomfort we can have is almost evolutionary.\"\n\nThe noise is also a legitimate nuisance. Floyd Shockley, co-leader of the Entomology Department at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History, said spending long periods of time around the bugs without hearing protection can be \"painful.\"\n\nExperts say the bugs aren't dangerous, but the noise and anxiety they can create are real concerns for some people. Here's what to know:\n\nWhat's happening with cicadas in spring 2024?\n\nTwo different groups, or broods, of cicadas, are expected to emerge in the Southeast and Midwest beginning in mid-May and lasting through late June. Brood XIX is expected to emerge in 14 states \u2013 including Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia. Brood XIII is expected in the Midwestern states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Wisconsin.\n\nDespite the the noise they produce, the critters are not otherwise harmful to humans and can provide environmental benefits, including a food source for birds, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nA bit of anxiety about the cicadas is normal\n\nIt's normal to feel a little anxious or uneasy as the noise ramps up and huge numbers of unfamiliar big bugs appear, Brownlowe said.\n\n\"But Americans largely shouldn't be afraid,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, people who experience sensory sensitives and live in areas where the cicadas will emerge are likely to feel more anxious about the noise from the critters than people without them \u2014 and for legitimate reason, said Zoe Gross, a director of advocacy at the national nonprofit organization Autistic Self Advocacy Network.\n\nNoise from the cicadas will be noticeable for those people, including autistic people, she said.\n\n\"It\u2019s much more magnified to you than it might be to someone without this disability,\" Gross said.\n\nAnd people who have difficulty with change will experience a double whammy, with the added noise and an unfamiliar environment when the seasons change, she said.\n\nAre cicadas loud enough to hurt your hearing?\n\nKind of.\n\nThey make a buzzing noise that can be as loud as a lawnmower. But only those who are exposed to large groups of the bugs for longer than 10 or 15 minutes could experience temporary hearing impairments, said Thomas Powers, who lives in New Jersey and provides management consulting to companies within the hearing health industry as the founder of Powers Consulting.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration's legal limit for noise level in the workplace is 90 decibels over the course of eight hours, an average workday in the U.S.\n\nCicadas in large groups can get up to 100 decibels, Powers said. But it's unlikely the average American will get close enough to them or stay near them long enough to experience any sort of hearing loss.\n\n\"By the time you get up to about 100 decibels, you shouldn\u2019t be in that environment for more than 15 minutes,\" Powers said. \"If I think back to cicadas here, well, they\u2019re interesting, but I'm not sure I want to stay up there for 6 to 8 hours listening to them.\"\n\nIn areas where a large number of cicadas have emerged and the males are all singing at the same time the sound can be \u201cimpressive,\u201d said Shockley.\n\n\u201cTo the point that I\u2019ve been in an area where I had to put earplugs in because they were so loud and so abundant that it was painful,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat can people do about the noise?\n\nThere are ways to tune out the fears before they become limiting to one's everyday life, Brownlowe said.\n\nExperts said best practices include:\n\nExposure therapy: Spending time outside around the bugs can make the experience less uneasy, Brownlowe said.\n\nThinking of the sounds cicadas exude as white noise.\n\nPlaying white noise or music in the background to distract from the noise of cicadas.\n\nWearing earplugs or headphones to lower the noise level.\n\nReading a social story, which is a scenario depicted in photos that can prepare people for an unfamiliar situation.\n\nCicadas 2024:2 broods to emerge together in US for first time in over 200 years\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

More than half the election officials said they are concerned the threats will make it difficult to retain and recruit election workers, the survey found.\n\nThreats arrive by text, email or phone call. The targets are election officials of both parties whose personal information has been posted on the internet. Or just election offices. The defendants that have been charged were often agitated about vote counting in swing states such as Arizona or Georgia or Michigan, where Biden won but where Trump falsely claimed the election was rigged or stolen.\n\nMore than one in five election officials will be serving in their first presidential election this year, according to a Brennan Center survey of election officials in March 2023. Turnover has been significant. An average of two election officials per day left their jobs since the 2020 election, the survey found.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a rise in the past few years in threats against election officials,\u201d said Andrew Garber, a lawyer on the Brennan Center\u2019s voting rights and election team. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel secure in their work.\u201d\n\nBecker said the volume of threats has remained high since the founding of a legal defense network in 2021 to provide election officials with advice and assistance responding to the harassment.\n\n\u201cElection officials all over the country feel as weary and exhausted as they did on Inauguration Day three years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland calls 'spike' in violent threats 'unacceptable'\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland announced the creation of the Justice Department Election Threats Task Force in June 2021 to ensure election workers \u2013 whether elected, appointed or volunteer \u2013 could do their jobs without threats and intimidation.\n\n\u201cAt the same time that we are seeing an encouraging downward trend in violent crime, we are also witnessing a deeply disturbing spike in threats against those who serve the public,\u201d including election workers, Garland said a conference to combat violent crime earlier this month. \u201cThese threats of violence are unacceptable. They threaten the fabric of our democracy.\u201d\n\nSo far, the task force has reviewed more than 2,000 incidents of hostility, harassment, abuse or threats to the election community, which includes elected officials, election staffers and volunteers, according to a Justice Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly. But more than 90% of the incidents didn\u2019t qualify for a federal criminal investigation for lack of a threat of unlawful violence because comments are often protected under the First Amendment.\n\nThe Justice Department gauges whether an abusive message constitutes a \u201ctrue threat\u201d before opening a criminal investigation. The definition of a true threat, according to a landmark Supreme Court case about cross burning, is a \u201cserious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence.\u201d\n\nThe department has charged 15 defendants with threatening election workers and won 11 convictions, with the longest prison term being three-and-a-half years. Dozens of threats remain under investigation.\n\nFederal prosecutors focus on threats that crossed state lines. The task force has held about 100 meetings to train state and local authorities how to investigate the cases.\n\nFederal officials have also been meeting with state and local officials in groups such as the National Association of Election Officials to aid local prosecutions. Local cases include a defendant charged with threatening officials in Atlantic County, New Jersey in 2023; a defendant charged with threatening the Colorado secretary of state in July 2022 and a defendant sentenced for threatening Arizona election officials in early 2022.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that election officials are not feeling the deterrent effect yet,\u201d Becker said of the program.\n\nIn perhaps the highest-profile case, Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss were flooded with racist death threats after Freeman and Moss were falsely accused of unloading carting in a \"suitcase\" of illegitimate votes in what Republican investigators confirmed was a routine storage container.\n\nFreeman went into hiding and had to sell her house. Moss' son worried about coming home to find her lynched.\n\nFreeman and Moss won a $148 million defamation suit against Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's lead campaign lawyer, who spread lies about the ballot container and USB sticks. Giuliani has vowed to appeal and is fighting the judgment in bankruptcy court.\n\nGeorgia official central to 2020 recount 'swatted'\n\nGabe Sterling, chief operating officer for Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, posted on X on Jan. 3 that his family had been \"swatted\" with somebody making a false report to police that a drug deal resulted in a shooting at his home.\n\nSwatting has become a widespread form of harassment. Shenna Bellows, the Maine secretary of state who barred Trump from the state ballot, reported on Facebook on Dec. 23 that her home had been swatted the day before with a false report about an emergency.\n\n\"This behavior is unacceptable,\" Bellows said. \"The non-stop threatening communications the people who work for me endured all day yesterday is unacceptable. It\u2019s designed to scare not only me but also others into silence, to send a message.\"\n\nStates adopt laws to protect election workers\n\nTo combat rising and pervasive threats against election workers, a variety of states adopted or broadened penalties for threatens or harassment. In the last year:\n\nNevada adopted penalties up to four years in prison for harassing, intimidating election workers performing their duties.\n\nMichigan established penalties for harassing or intimidating election officials in a way that prevents them from doing their jobs. The maximum penalty for a first offense is 93 days in jail and a $500 fine, and a third offense makes the crime a felony.\n\nMinnesota created civil penalties and a $1,000 fine for threatening, intimidating or harassing election workers. While state law previously protected election workers from assault, the law makes it illegal to interfere with an election, distribute information about an official or physically obstruct election officials.\n\nIn 2022, Colorado and Oregon prohibited threats against election workers or the release of their personal information, Maine outlawed interfering with an election worker\u2019s official duties through threats and violence, and Georgia made it illegal to prevent poll officers from performing their duties.\n\nPaul Smith, senior vice president the Campaign Legal Center, an advocacy group that worked on the legislation with state lawmakers, called local and state election officials \u201cthe backbone of the whole system.\u201d But he said they are under stress because so many are new, after departures because of threats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough time and some of them have said, \u2018I don\u2019t need this,\u2019\u201d Smith said. \u201cPro-democracy forces are going to be on high alert and are going to be as ready as we can be.\u201d\n\nThreats spur lawyer and family to get 24-hour protection, wear body armor\n\nIn the Texas case, Frederick Goltz, then-52 years old, of Lubbock, posted threatening messages on the social networking site Patriots.win, an online community of Trump supporters, and on Gab.com, a network for far-right users, according to court records.\n\nIn response to a Patriots.win post complaining Nov. 21, 2022, about ballots that were \"canceled\" because of election machine malfunctions, Goltz posted the name, address and phone number of an election worker in Maricopa County, Arizona, and said: \u201cSomeone needs to get these people AND their children,\u201d according to court records. Goltz had posted threatening statements against government officials on Gab.com on Dec. 1, 2022, according to court records. \"Yeah, but when it's me, I'm willing to take lives,\" Goltz said. \"This means their children are not off limits, either.\"\n\nThe victim, a deputy county attorney who worked on elections, testified at Goltz\u2019s sentencing in August that he, his wife and four children were assigned round-the-clock protection and issued body armor because of the threat, according to court records.\n\nGoltz pleaded guilty to interstate threatening communications and was sentenced to 42 months in prison. But Goltz has appealed the sentence to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by arguing \"his advocacy of illegal acts and political hyperbole was not a true threat.\"\n\nIn another Arizona case, Mark Rissi, then-64, of Hiawatha, Hawaii, left a threatening voicemail on Sept. 27, 2021, for an official with the Maricopa County board of supervisors, according to court records. \"You're gonna die, you piece of\" expletive, Rissi said. \"We're going to hang you.\" Rissi also called Mark Brnovich, the state's Republican attorney general, on Dec. 8, 2021, and left a voicemail claiming he was the \"victim of a crime\" because of the \"theft of the 2020 election,\" according to court records. \"Do you job, Brnovich, or you will hang with those (expletive) in the end,\" Rissi said. \"We will see to it. Torches and pitchforks.\"\n\nRissi was sentenced to two and half years in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of sending threatening communications.\n\nIn the Michigan case, Katelyn Jones, 26, of Epping, New Hampshire, pleaded guilty to two counts of making interstate threats in November 2020 against Monica Palmer, the Republican former chairperson of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, according to court records.\n\nPalmer led a raucous meeting Nov. 17, 2020, and voted to certify the election results after initially voting against certification. Trump and his supporters fought in a half-dozen swing states to postpone the certification of election results so they could mount legal challenges and potentially have Congress reject presidential electors for Biden in contested states.\n\nJones admitted texting Palmer messages the morning after the meeting calling her a \u201cdisgusting racist bitch,\u201d followed by pictures of the dead woman and messages such as \u201cyou should be afraid, your daughter should be afraid and so should\u201d her husband, according to court records. Palmer received similar threats on Instagram.\n\nWhen FBI agents interviewed Jones after searching her house in December 2020, she admitted sending the texts and making the Instagram post because she was angry about Palmer's vote to certify the election. Jones was sentenced on Jan. 16 to 30 days in federal jail.\n\nIn the Florida case, Joshua Lubitz, then-38, was charged after making threats at a polling station in the Sunrise Senior Center in August 2022. While inside, Lubitz was heard counting election workers and asking whether he should kill them one at a time or blow them up. After voting and leaving, he drove past the location and made a threatening gesture toward poll workers.\n\nLubitz suffered mental health problems that prevented him from finishing college and he was twice hospitalized for severe anxiety, according to court records. He pleaded guilty to voter intimidation and was sentenced to three years of supervised probation.\n\nElection experts worry that further claims to undermine the results this year could lead to more threats and potentially violence.\n\n\"Our elections now are as secure as they\u2019ve ever been,\" Becker said. \u201cMy concern is more that that might not matter to the losing candidate and his supporters, and that will lead to further abuse, harassment and threats, and potentially broader political violence.\""}

Fleeing the chilly river, herds of sea cows crowded into the warmer waters of the spring run.\n\nGiven the clear, glassy conditions and the hundreds of manatees crowded together and floating on top of each other \u2013 park rangers suspected a possible record count. They doubled up, having two rangers each count along the run, which meanders four-tenths of a mile from the spring, where the water bursts from an underground cavern, to the river.\n\nTheir final tally \u2013 932 \u2013 didn\u2019t just set a record. It rocketed past previous records, even the 736 they counted on New Year\u2019s Day. It\u2019s a far cry from the single-day record of 49 manatees celebrated 40 years ago, and more than twice as many manatees as the single day record set just 10 years ago.\n\nThe new record is breathtaking and incredible for those who have watched over and rooted for these animals for decades.\n\n\"Thrilling and nearly unbelievable!\u201d said John Bengston, a federal wildlife ecologist in Alaska. When Bengston completed his doctoral research on manatees in the St. Johns River in 1981, only 35 of the bewhiskered marine mammals were seen in the spring run during a record high single day count.\n\n\u201cThose high numbers are heartening, and a tribute to the conservation efforts and awareness of scientists, natural resource managers, and the public over the past several decades,\u201d Bengston told USA TODAY.\n\nPreviously:See the iconic Florida manatees as they keep fighting for survival\n\nThe thriving manatee population in the St. Johns is rooted in a range of protective efforts taken over decades, often through protracted legal battles and contentious public meetings.\n\nThe numbers show those hard-fought protective measures are working, said David Hankla, a retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service field office director and veteran of some of those bitter battles.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019d expect for an animal not experiencing unnatural mortality,\u201d Hankla said. \u201cI suspect (the St. Johns) is one of the safer places to be for manatees,\" Hankla said.\n\nAt a state scale, \u201cmanatees have done extraordinarily well,\u201d he said. In the early 1990s, the population was estimated at around 1,500. Last fall, Florida officials estimated the state\u2019s manatee population at between 8,350 and 11,730, based on an assessment from 2021-2022.\n\nFlorida manatees share the state's waters with a million registered vessels and almost 22 million people. While the St. Johns manatees thrive under protected conditions, others face great peril.\n\nIn the Indian River Lagoon, on the state's east coast, more than 1,000 manatees died over a two-year span between 2020-2022, many starving from a lack of healthy seagrass after years of massive algal blooms. Poor water quality from a variety of contributing factors is blamed.\n\nMore:Florida's starving manatees reflect troubles in coastal ecosystems around the globe\n\nManatees also see higher death rates on the state\u2019s southwest coast, where they contend with busy waters, red tide algal blooms and other water quality problems.\n\nFederal officials downlisted manatees from endangered to threatened in 2017, but announced last October they will review whether the manatee should be considered endangered again, given the increase in deaths in 2021 and 2022.\n\nSea cows come in from the cold, get counted\n\nSusceptible to cold stress when water temperatures drop below 68 degrees, the manatees are attracted to Blue Spring because its waters can be 20 degrees or more warmer than the river.\n\nAlthough it's commonly repeated that the spring water is \u201ca constant\u201d 72 or 73, U.S. Geological Survey data shows the water is warming. Temperatures in the spring run now range from 73.5 - 76.\n\nOnce they arrive, counting living animals stacked up on top of each other underwater isn't always an exact science, said Connor Wagner, park service specialist at Blue Spring.\n\nThe park rangers start early, just after first light and before the park opens, counting from boardwalks and overlooks while the manatees are undisturbed and still.\n\nResearchers with the Save The Manatee Club also count manatees in the spring run almost daily and work to identify individual animals. One of those, Wayne Hartley, was a park specialist at Blue Spring before retiring.\n\nHe has paddled a canoe among the sea cows for more than 40 years, identifying individuals based on unique propeller scars and other body characteristics. These days he\u2019s amazed by the number of manatees he can\u2019t identify because they don\u2019t have any prop scars.\n\nOn the day the park counted 932, Hartley and colleague Cora Berchem got into the water about an hour after the park rangers started, after the manatees had begun to move around and the wind picked up. Hartley said they counted nearly 700 manatees.\n\nSometimes the park's count is higher, sometimes the club's count is higher, he said. \"Sometimes you see better from the boardwalk. Sometimes you see better from the canoe.\"\n\nOverall this season, Hartley and a colleague have identified more than 800 individual manatees, including more than 80 calves.\n\nSuch numbers are astonishing to Hartley, and to the many biologists, advocates and elected officials who survived the battles that set the stage for this success story.\n\nLocal resident Arnette Sherman visits the park a few days a week. It's \"thrilling to see so many manatees at one time,\" Sherman said.\n\nSaving manatees in the St. Johns River\n\nManatees have been protected in Florida since the late 1800s and were among 70 animals added to the nation's first endangered species list in 1967.\n\nBut many credit acclaimed oceanographer Jacques Cousteau with riveting public attention on manatees. Cousteau visited Blue Spring, then a privately owned fish camp in 1971, filming the animals' scarred backs and people trying to ride them. Months after the episode aired on \"The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau\u201d in January 1972, the state bought the spring.\n\nBy 1989, Florida had become a legal and political battleground as government agencies \u2013 prodded by the Save the Manatee Club and other nonprofits \u2013 worked to enact protections. The single day high count at Blue Spring that year was 57 manatees.\n\nThe state ordered key counties to write protection plans, with boat speed limits to curtail collisions in areas frequented by manatees. The plan was particularly contentious in Volusia County, home of Blue Spring.\n\nLocal, state and federal officials, along with advocates and boaters, tussled over boat speeds for more than a decade.\n\nBoaters and fishermen were concerned about economic impacts and argued they wouldn\u2019t be able to cover as much ground between fishing spots. Bumper stickers cropped up proclaiming: \"Welcome to Florida, where manatees are more precious than children.\" At one point, an elected official exclaimed in angry frustration that the county should \u201copen a manatee canning factory.\u201d\n\nBut the gruesome vessel-related deaths of two manatees in the St. Johns in 1991 added fuel to the push to protect the animals. One of those, Sweet Gums, an animal featured in the manatee club's adopt-a-manatee program, suffered five deep gashes from a propeller, her spine severed in two places.\n\nSimilar battles were waged for a decade over plans to restore the spring\u2019s water flow, which forced local utilities to find alternatives to meet the water needs of a rapidly growing population. And, the state park angered swimmers when it closed the water to people during the winter to give the manatees space.\n\nIn those contentious years, 800 or 900 manatees in the spring would have seemed \u201coutlandish,\u201d Hankla said. But together, the measures accomplished their purpose, creating a haven where the animals thrive.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nToday Blue Spring State Park attracts about 700,000 visitors a year, more than half during the winter, and the wait to get into the park on the busiest days may take hours. On the river, boaters and anglers share the water with ecotourists viewing the abundant wildlife.\n\nThe manatee numbers show the protective measures are working, Hankla said. But if the water quality or quantity diminishes, it\u2019s a problem, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen happen in the Indian River.\u201d\n\nThe state could go a step further to help manatees in the St. Johns, he said. They could finally dismantle the Rodman Dam about 46 miles north of Blue Spring on the Ocklawaha River.\n\nRemoving the dam would give manatees unfettered access to the Ocklawaha, a major tributary to the St. Johns. That action has long been controversial with fishermen and some local elected officials, and so far the opposition has been victorious.\n\nBut, if the dam were removed, or if the lock operation was changed, Hankla said the Ocklawaha could support a \u201cpretty substantial\u201d number of manatees.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t require you to do anything other than let them in,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty significant opportunity.\u201d"}

It's what (first) brought people here and what brings people back to study this region,\u201d said Mammoth Cave National Park spokesperson Molly Schroer. \u201cI mean, what drives a person to go into a dark, mysterious hole in the ground? It\u2019s curiosity.\u201d\n\nHundreds of thousands of visitors are drawn to the Kentucky marvel each year.\n\n\u201cWhen they get down there and they feel that darkness and they feel that sense of wonder, they really do connect to the cave and see what a special location it is,\u201d Schroer said.\n\nHere\u2019s what travelers should know about Mammoth Cave, the latest national park in USA TODAY\u2019s yearlong series.\n\nWhat is special about Mammoth Cave?\n\nMammoth Cave is the longest-known cave system in the world.\n\n\u201cThere are caves that have larger rooms, but we are the longest,\u201d Schroer said. \u201cWe are currently mapped at 426 miles. We are still finding more cave. The explorers tell us there\u2019s no end in sight at this point.\u201d\n\nThe cave is a natural wonder but also significant to human history.\n\n\u201cMammoth Cave is one of the few places in the world where we can trace the transition from hunter-gatherers to an agricultural community,\u201d Schroer said. \u201cPrehistoric people from the Late Archaic and Early Woodland period inhabited the forests and plains of Kentucky and focused on the river valleys and their abundant resources. Researchers have traced the rise of farming in these groups by looking at pre-historic poo found inside the caves.\u201d\n\nWhat is the origin of the Mammoth Cave?\n\nMammoth Cave is located about 30 minutes outside Bowling Green, Kentucky by car. According to the park\u2019s website, prehistoric seas deposited limestone in the area around 325 million years ago.\n\nThen, about 10 million years ago, Schroer said, \u201cWater started trickling down through the cracks that are within that limestone and began to slowly eat away at the passageways to form Mammoth Cave.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still going.\n\n\u201cThere's currently about what we call five levels of cave passageways, and that lowest level, the fifth level at the bottom, still has water in it actively forming new caves,\u201d she added.\n\nDid Native Americans use Mammoth Cave?\n\nAccording to the park, from about 5,000 to 2,000 B.C.E., Native Americans explored the cave and mined for minerals like gypsum.\n\n\u201cWe know that they explored many, many miles of the cave, which is pretty amazing,\u201d Schroer said.\n\nThey also appear to have used the caves for some burials. The park has worked with tribal partners to ensure \u201cthe deceased have a safe and secure resting place in locations away from cave tours.\u201d\n\nThese seven tribes have historic ties to Mammoth Cave:\n\nStory continues below.\n\nCan you go in Mammoth Cave for free?\n\nThere\u2019s no entrance fee for Mammoth Cave National Park, but visitors do have to pay to enter the caves, which are only accessible with cave tours.\n\n\u201cIt's for resource protection, one, because we don't want people writing on the walls. That has happened,\u201d Schroer said. \u201cThere's also many different directions you can take when you get down there, so it is for the protection of people too, that they don't wander off somewhere that they shouldn't be and get lost.\u201d\n\nMost tours are guided. A self-guided tour is sometimes available in the summer, but it still requires a ticket.\n\nTours prices currently start $8 for most visitors age 13 and up. However prices are set to increase on March 1. Visitors are encouraged to book tours in advance as they can sell out.\n\nHow long does it take to walk through Mammoth Cave?\n\nEach guided tour has a different duration, but visitors can take their time on the self-guided version, which is limited to certain areas of the cave.\n\nSchroer said some visitors pop in and out while others can spend an hour and a half reading signage, talking to rangers stationed along the way and soaking it all in.\n\nIs Mammoth Cave wheelchair friendly?\n\nMost of Mammoth Cave is not wheelchair accessible, but there is one accessible cave tour.\n\n\u201cWe take people down in an elevator,\u201d Schroer said. \u201cThey're able to see a portion of the cave that is level and has been hardened, and then we can take them back out of that via the elevator.\u201d\n\nWhat can we do at Mammoth Cave?\n\n\u201cThe cave is just one part of the park,\u201d Schroer said. \u201cWe say half of the park is underground. Obviously, the other part is in the sunny side of the world. We have canoeing and kayaking on some great rivers \u2026 We also have over 80 miles of hiking, biking and horseback riding trails, so it's good to see the above surface.\u201d\n\nPark rangers lead several free walks and talks above ground, including some dark sky programs, which can be found on the park\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cIt's more than just a one-day visit,\u201d Schroer said. \u201cIf you want to stay for a couple of days, you can find plenty of recreational opportunities.\u201d\n\nHow deep is the Bottomless Pit in Mammoth Cave?\n\n\u201cThe Bottomless Pit is only about 105 feet deep, but back in the early 1800s, when (settlers) were first exploring and touring the cave, the tourists that would get to the area known as the Bottomless Pit would look down and their little lanterns would not show the bottom, so it looked like it went on forever,\u201d Schroer said.\n\nThe first known formal tour of Mammoth Cave was given in 1816, long before it became part of the National Park Service in 1941. One of Mammoth Cave\u2019s most famous early guides was an enslaved man named Stephen Bishop. In 1838, he and a cave visitor became the first people known to cross the Bottomless Pit, according to the park.\n\n'I'm here to give a voice':Ranger's great-great-grandfather was an enslaved guide at Mammoth Cave\n\nWhat creature was found in Mammoth Cave?\n\nA wealth of ancient shark fossils have been uncovered in Mammoth Cave, including two newly discovered species announced earlier this week.\n\nSchroer said more than 70 species of sharks and their relatives have been identified so far, including several new to science. \u201cThey have even found preservation of three-dimensional skeletal cartilage that has helped scientists understand the anatomy and relationships of ancient sharks,\u201d she said.\n\nMany remarkable creatures still live inside Mammoth Cave.\n\n\u201cWe have eyeless fish,\u201d Schroer said. \u201cThey're down in the lowest section of the cave. They've evolved (so) that they have no eyesight because they don't need it in a world of total darkness. They're pale. They're white. You can kind of see their organs on the inside. They're very interesting.\u201d\n\nThere are also endangered Kentucky Cave Shrimp, which are found nowhere else in the world. They, too, are eyeless and clear.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of cave crickets,\u201d Schroer said. \u201cThey are a keystone species of the cave because they go out to the surface feed, then come back in to lay eggs. So they're bringing food sources into the cave to reach those creatures that never leave the cave, so they're very important for the habitat and ecosystem of the cave.\u201d"}

Your knees and hips appreciate a recalibrated definition of \u201cadventure\u201d that favors excursions like water taxi rides and birdwatching. And, yes, your hunch is right: You really are turning into your mother (or father) \u2026 and maybe that\u2019s not such a terrible thing.\n\nI recently spent six days visiting my parents in their winter snowbird home just outside of Tampa, Florida. Mom and Dad reveled in the tour guide role here in this middle ground \u2013 not our Indiana hometown and not British Columbia, where I\u2019ve been living with my kids for years.\n\nIt felt strange at first, me being a \u201ckid\u201d again at age 50. It was a rare window when I wasn\u2019t caring for my own kids and my parents, still healthy and mobile, didn\u2019t yet need my care. I could relax. I could play. Without any responsibilities or distractions, I could savor just being a daughter.\n\nFUN FOR ALL AGES: 50 family vacation ideas for the best trip ever\n\nIt feels good to slow down a little\n\nVacating with my parents, I got to experience life at a slower pace. My mom didn\u2019t hesitate to say yes to the hour-long wait when we put in our name at the popular Rusty Bellies oceanfront restaurant in Tarpon Springs. I followed Mom to the Adirondack chairs outside, but soon got restless, feeling like I should be doing something. But she encouraged me to stay put and do nothing, reminding me that I\u2019m always caring for someone in this busy season of life and that it\u2019s OK to rest too. That moment of stillness made room for easy conversation that led to her telling me the story of how my parents first met.\n\nAnother day, because we ambled long enough in a mangrove sanctuary, we saw the fins of black-tip sharks and cute noses of manatees break the surface of the water. And since we took our time at the Armature Works green space waiting for the water taxi on downtown Tampa\u2019s Riverwalk, we spotted dolphins playing and got good at deciphering the locals (dogs, laptops, long pants) from the tourists.\n\nVacation ideas for older travelers:\n\nBeing together still comes easily\n\nEven though I\u2019ve lived away from my parents for decades, I realized during our week together how well I still know their idiosyncrasies and they know mine. I know my dad will check the forecast before we head out for the day. He knows I\u2019m going to sneeze when he gives me a piece of peppermint gum, and starts laughing when I do. I\u2019m not surprised when my mom stops to hug me as we walk across a parking lot \u2026 just because we\u2019re together. And the three of us still find the same things funny, including the mustache baby pacifier at The Dal\u00ed (the Salvador Dali Museum) gift shop.\n\nHASSLE-FREE TRIPS: 10 tropical destinations you can visit without a U.S. passport\n\nMidwesterners tend to get stuck in routines, and some of that is what I wanted to break free of when I moved to the West Coast years ago. But on this trip, I found a strange comfort in doing many of the same things we used to do together \u2013 church on Sunday, a major league baseball game, and dinner with longtime family friends who still call me by my old nickname.\n\nMom, Dad and I even visited some of the same places we first went to during a childhood vacation together in 1979. Our history of good memories together keeps hitting me\u2014throughout the trip, I was reminded of who I am and where I came from. I let it sink in, this sense of knowing and being known, of deep connection. Somehow it satisfied a longing I didn\u2019t even know I had.\n\nAs an adult kid, I see myself in my parents\n\nIn downtown Tampa, we stepped off the trolley at the Ybor City stop into the city\u2019s \u201cLittle Havana\u201d neighborhood. Cuban music filled streets lined with restaurants and cigar bars. We popped into one cigar lounge, dark and smoky, and were mesmerized watching busy hands rolling cigars. Dad pointed out all the leaf scrap cuttings on the floor. Mom noted the unique purses made of cigar boxes. At that moment, I realized this is why I am curious and observant, and I felt strangely sentimental. It\u2019s because of them.\n\nRAIL VACATIONS: 12 best Amtrak rides and scenic train rides in North America\n\nOver lunch at The Hangar Restaurant and Flight Lounge, a favorite spot overlooking the airstrip at St. Petersburg\u2019s Albert Whitted Airport, we watched small planes and helicopters coming and going. Dad recalled memories of flying with his friend, who had a little Cessna. He laughed and, in his easy way, shared some near-miss flight stories we hadn\u2019t heard before: a downdraft in the Smoky Mountains, losing altitude, and scanning the ground for a flat potential landing space before getting through it. Sitting there listening to him, I saw my own love for travel and adventure.\n\nOn this trip, I realized just how much I see myself in my parents. I was a little surprised to realize this fact didn\u2019t make me roll my eyes and make an \u201cI\u2019m turning into my mother\u201d joke. Instead, I found myself smiling and embracing turning into my mother and father, because that\u2019s exactly who I\u2019ve always been.\n\nMy parents have always enjoyed watching ocean sunsets. When I was growing up, it was one of those things that happened in the background on our family beach vacations while we were swimming, playing ball, or searching for sand dollars. This time around, though, the sunset was the main event. I noticed my parents and other locals about their age planning their evenings around it, bringing a chair, and even going to a special spot on Indian Rocks Beach where a retired guy brings his trumpet and plays \u201cTaps\u201d to celebrate the daily setting of the sun.\n\nBEST USE OF SPACE: These are my 9 favorite underseat carry-on bags\n\nIt was a surprising moment of joy, and Dad captured it. He has always loved photographing ocean sunsets on vacation, and now he gets to do it for six months every year as a snowbird. I used to be bored looking at sunsets, but now I find myself sending him my own sunset photos from home in Canada. My daughters do the same with me. I guess a sense of awe and wonder is hereditary, too.\n\nThese moments are pure gold (and fleeting)\n\nTraveling with my aging parents, I realized how lucky I am, but also knew this could be our last trip together, just the three of us. I couldn\u2019t help but reflect on how fragile life is and how precious these moments together are. My parents are still together, in good health, and have mobility. I can\u2019t think of anyone my age at 50 who is in the same situation with their parents.\n\nAt a Clearwater Beach souvenir shop on my last day of the trip, Mom bought us matching blue sweatshirts we both liked. I think it was her way of marking this time together with a tangible reminder. As she handed me mine, I pushed away the thought that this might be the last time we get to vacation like this and replaced it with gratitude.\n\nCHIC AND COMFY: 10 most comfortable travel clothes brands for the whole family\n\nOn the drive to the airport, Dad launched into his usual sort of closing paragraph that he does at the end of every visit. He mentioned the highlights of the week and asked about everyone else\u2019s favorite memories from our time together. Then he shifted to what we wanted to do next time. I smiled, realizing I do this closing paragraph, too, when I\u2019m saying goodbye to my girls.\n\nI cried at the goodbye like I always do with my parents, then boarded my flight and took my seat next to a young mom with a baby girl on her lap. I cooed and made silly faces the same way other women did when my girls were young and I traveled alone on trips home to see my parents and felt the sweet weight of this full circle moment.\n\nHow a vacation with my aging parents changed my whole perspective on travel originally appeared onFamilyVacationist.com.\n\nMore from FamilyVacationist:\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this column are the author\u2019s and do not necessarily reflect those of USA TODAY.

The elaborate stateroom serves as the coolest possible digs for a family trip on the world\u2019s biggest cruise ship, which set sail on its maiden voyage on Jan. 27.\n\nJason Liberty, president and CEO of the line\u2019s parent company Royal Caribbean Group, told USA TODAY the townhouse and the Ultimate Family Suites on other ships in the fleet are spaces \u201cwhere you can bring families together, multiple generations together, and you can have an incredible experience inside the cabin.\u201d\n\nHow big is the Ultimate Family Townhouse?\n\nThe three-level structure is even bigger than the two-story Ultimate Family Suites. At 1,772 square feet, the townhouse can accommodate up to 8 guests.\n\nThere is also a 410-square-foot balcony on the main level, a 90-square-foot balcony on the second floor, and a 251-square-foot patio.\n\nWhat can guests expect?\n\nIcon is packed with activities across the ship, but townhouse guests have plenty of ways to play without leaving their room. Those include a slide that connects the second and main levels \u2013 I saw kids and adults alike testing it out while touring the room during a preview cruise last month \u2013 an in-suite theater with karaoke, table tennis on the patio; and more.\n\nThe rainbow-colored staircase also plays music as people walk up and down. Guests can choose from songs like \u201cLondon Bridge Is Falling Down\u201d or free play, and customize the instrument, with options including piano, violin and trumpet (they can also turn it off if they want peace and quiet).\n\nLocated in the ship\u2019s Surfside neighborhood \u2013 designed especially for young families \u2013 guests also have easy access to aqua parks, a carousel, restaurants like Pier 7 (which serves all-day brunch) and more, just beyond the townhouse\u2019s picket fence on Deck 7.\n\nThe two-bedroom space has a king bed, two sets of bunk beds (one of which can fold into the wall leaving just a couch), and a double sofa bed. There are also three bathrooms and floor-to-ceiling windows with striking ocean views, thanks to the suite\u2019s location at the aft of the ship.\n\nHow much does the Ultimate Family Townhouse cost?\n\nLike the rest of Icon, the townhouse saw high demand ahead of its debut. Michael Bayley, the line\u2019s president and CEO, said the room was 55% booked for 2024 during Royal Caribbean Group\u2019s February 2023 earnings call, just over three months after revealing details about the ship.\n\nThere is still availability to be found, though. Prices vary by sailing date, but the townhouse starts at $23,353 per person for two adults and two kids on a 7-night Eastern Caribbean cruise departing from Miami, Florida, on May 17, 2025, according to Royal Caribbean\u2019s website.\n\nIcon of the Seas guide:How to get the most of the world's biggest cruise ship\n\nThe hefty price tag also comes with many perks. The fare includes gratuities, Wi-Fi, laundry and pressing services, priority embarkation and disembarkation and more. Guests will also have a Royal Genie that can help grant their wishes during their stay, like making reservations for onboard restaurants and helping guests avoid waiting in lines.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The reporter on this story received access to this cruise from Royal Caribbean International, which is owned by Royal Caribbean Group.

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight O\u2019Neill, 47, will make history as Northern Ireland\u2019s first republican leader, from a party that wants north and south to come together, someday, as a single country.\n\n\u201cIt represents truly historic change in the north and across the island of Ireland,\u201d she said in a statement to The Washington Post.\n\nCalling it a \u201cgood day for democracy,\u201d O\u2019Neill noted that the restoration of government \u201crespects the result\u201d of the May 2022 election \u2014 when Sinn F\u00e9in for the first time won the largest share of seats in the assembly and the right to hold the first minister job under Northern Ireland\u2019s delicate power-sharing agreement.\n\nBut O\u2019Neill also emphasized that she will be \u201ca First Minister for All\u201d \u2014 that means unionists and republicans, Protestants and Catholics, those who want a \u201cUnited Ireland\u201d and those who want to remain \u201cBritish Forever\u201d (alongside a growing number in the middle ground).\n\nEarlier this week, Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn F\u00e9in president and leader of the opposition in the Republic of Ireland, declared that Irish unity was \u201cwithin touching distance.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill seems to be staying away from language like that this week, and experts say the prospect of a united Ireland remains some way off, more a medium-term project than imminent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there is no doubt that the political landscape of Northern Ireland is changing.\n\nFor decades, the unionists have held the greater share of the power here \u2014 proudly declaring Northern Ireland\u2019s status as one of the four nations of the United Kingdom, alongside England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nIt was the unionists who boycotted the government for these past two years. Overtly, their gripe was with post-Brexit trade arrangements. But many people suspected they also didn\u2019t want to accept Sinn F\u00e9in playing a more dominant role.\n\nAnd so, for the past 730 days, there wasn\u2019t a functioning government at the Stormont estate, the seat of power in Northern Ireland. No executive, no assembly \u2014 though lawmakers continued to draw two-thirds of their salaries.\n\nThe gift shop and the cafeteria remained open. Schoolchildren visited. But unelected civil servants were left to keep the lights on, while avoiding any major decisions.\n\nA breakthrough came earlier this week, when Jeffrey Donaldson announced that his Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had struck a deal with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s government to tweak some of the trade and customs arrangements for goods crossing the Irish Sea.\n\nThe changes are described by Brexit experts as minor but important to the unionists, who have argued that requiring checks and customs declarations drives a wedge between Great Britain and Northern Ireland while drawing the north deeper into an all-Ireland economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrade wasn\u2019t a problem when Britain and the Republic of Ireland were both part of the European Union\u2019s Common Market. But with Brexit, negotiators had to find a way to protect the integrity of the E.U.'s market without creating a visible border on the island of Ireland that could undermine the Good Friday peace agreement that ended 30 years of sectarian and state violence known as \u201cthe Troubles.\u201d\n\nDonaldson claimed a win with this week\u2019s trade adjustments, saying they would \u201csafeguard our place within the Union.\u201d\n\nThe Good Friday agreement \u2014 brokered in part by the United States \u2014 ushered in the modern age of devolved power sharing in Northern Ireland. There is no winner-take-all here today.\n\nOfficially, there will be no difference in power between O\u2019Neill and the new deputy first minister, who will probably be Emma Little-Pengelly of the DUP. They will be co-equals and co-leaders. One may shake the hand of a visiting world leader first, but they share duties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet one is called a deputy, and here that matters.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cLike with everything in Northern Ireland, having Michelle O\u2019Neill as first minister is mostly symbolic,\u201d said Matthew O\u2019Toole, a lawmaker in the assembly from the Social Democratic and Labour Party.\n\nThen he cautioned, \u201cBeing symbolic doesn\u2019t make it unimportant.\u201d\n\nS\u00edobhra Aiken, a lecturer at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, called O\u2019Neill\u2019s rise to first minister \u201ca sea change.\u201d\n\nShe said that with the partition of the island in 1921, \u201cthe infrastructure of Northern Ireland was specifically designed so that this would not happen. ... Northern Ireland was created to have an Ulster Protestant majority.\u201d\n\nWhen Martin McGuinness, a former IRA leader turned peacemaker, became the first deputy first minister from Sinn F\u00e9in in 2007, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for unionists to accuse him of having blood on his hands.\n\nNow, with elections in the south next year, Aiken said, \u201cWe could soon see Sinn F\u00e9in holding power in both jurisdictions on this island.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelfast-based feminist historian Margaret Ward said this moment was \u201chuge in terms of Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s evolution,\u201d as well as the evolution of government in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up, Stormont was irrelevant, because it was a male, unionist and very middle-class establishment that didn\u2019t have working-class people\u2019s interests at heart \u2014 whether they were Catholics or Protestants,\u201d she said. \u201cOver a period of about half a century, you could count the number of women engaged in elected office on both hands.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s rise has been remarkable. A Catholic from a rural county, she was a mother at 16 and has spoken often of her hardscrabble youth. Today she is savvy talent with a long political track record, and is all over social media \u2014 and popular with young people wanting selfies.\n\nShe comes from a deeply republican household. Her father was imprisoned for IRA membership during the Troubles and later made the transition into politics when he became a local Sinn F\u00e9in lawmaker. Her uncle was a president of Noraid, a republican fundraising group active in the United States, which U.S. government accused of funneling money to buy IRA guns. Noraid leaders deny this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Jim Allister, the sole member of the legislative assembly from the Traditional Unionist Voice party, O\u2019Neill hasn\u2019t sufficiently distanced herself from IRA violence. After condemning this week\u2019s tweaked trade deal by his fellow unionists as \u201cnothing by spin and hype,\u201d he told The Post that he would return to the assembly on Saturday, but he opposed the choice for first minister.\n\n\u201cMichelle O\u2019Neill is a lady who told the people of Northern Ireland that there was no alternative to the butchery and genocide of the IRA. She justifies those acts,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think she is wholly unworthy to hold this high office, or any democratic office, if she thinks it was right and necessary to murder and to butcher innocent people.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, O\u2019Neill was asked by the BBC about the IRA violence during the Troubles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any Irish person ever woke up one morning and thought that conflict was a good idea, but the war came to Ireland,\u201d she said.\n\nShe continued, \u201cI think at the time there was no alternative, but now, thankfully, we have an alternative to conflict and that\u2019s the Good Friday agreement.\u201d\n\nAlex Maskey, 72, has been speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly since 2020 and was the first member of Sinn F\u00e9in to serve as lord mayor of Belfast, from 2002 to 2003. He will be retiring on Saturday when a new speaker is elected.\n\n\u201cThe symbolism of Michelle O\u2019Neill as the first republican first minister will not be lost on a lot of people. For me, that\u2019s a positive thing,\u201d he said.\n\nMaskey said he still hoped someday to live in a united Ireland."}

Rachmaninoff, who was in the prime of his enormous career, was so impressed with her that he offered to teach Slenczynska at his apartment in Paris. Nine decades later, she is believed to be his only living student.\n\nAs she approached her 99th birthday last month, Slenczynska thought hard about those lessons with Rachmaninoff, as well as her own remarkable career, which started when she was 4 and her legs were too small to reach the piano pedals, so they were raised for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter almost 95 years in front of the keys, she decided it was time to retire.\n\nA former child prodigy and the last living piano student of Sergei Rachmaninoff, Ruth Slenczynska, 99, played Chopin's Prelude in F Major in 2023.

Her childhood was punishing.\n\n\u201cDuring bad times, it was music that got me through,\u201d said Slenczynska, now living with one of her former piano students near Hershey, Penn. \u201cWhen I was a child, music was always my escape.\u201d\n\nNow retired, Slenczynska said she is content to enjoy the quiet as she reflects upon almost a century of performing. The Classic FM radio website featured her story on her 99th birthday last month.\n\nSlenczynska was born in Sacramento, but her family moved to Australia to be near her father\u2019s brother when she was nine months old. She said she was 1 \u00bd when she first sat at a piano bench with her father, Joseph Slenczynska, a Polish immigrant and violinist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy father started showing me the notes on the piano when my mother was in the hospital having her second baby,\u201d Slenczynska said. \u201cHe was restless and didn\u2019t have anything else to do, so he gave me a little lesson.\u201d\n\nRuth Slenczynska, 5, plays the piano in Philadelphia in 1930. (Video: University of South Carolina)\n\nBy age 3, her father had implemented a rigorous practice routine. Slenczynska recalled him being domineering and abusive.\n\n\u201cHe wanted more than he could get out of everybody, including me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat would you call a person who beat you for every little mistake you made? It was miserable.\u201d\n\nAs she grew up, Slenczynska said her father forced her to practice the piano for nine hours a day while her two younger sisters played outside. Her family had moved to Paris when she was 4 so she would have access to the best teachers as she progressed in her piano studies.\n\n\u201cI wanted to join [my sisters], but if I didn\u2019t want to practice, I was chased around with a stick,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I found comfort and beauty in the music. It was a way to get away from [my father.] I could think about how beautiful the music was, and I didn\u2019t feel so bad.\u201d\n\nSlenczynska\u2019s difficult early years were chronicled in her 1957 memoir, \u201cForbidden Childhood.\u201d\n\nShe was 6 when she performed in concert in Berlin in 1931, and she was 7 when she performed with a full orchestra in Paris. Programs billed her as one of the greatest child prodigies since Mozart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWas I scared to perform? Of course,\u201d she said. \u201cI still am. But it is something you become accustomed to. I would just become absorbed in the music.\u201d\n\nShe soon became the moneymaker for her family, she said, with concert tours filling her schedule and a private tutor to keep her caught up with schoolwork in Paris.\n\nAfter she\u2019d substituted for Rachmaninoff in Los Angeles when she was 9, she and her father returned home and received an invitation to visit Rachmaninoff at the residential hotel in Paris where he practiced during the week, she said.\n\n\u201cHe lived in Switzerland, but his wife wasn\u2019t thrilled to hear him practicing 17 hours a day,\u201d Slenczynska said. \u201cSo he would come to Paris to practice Monday through Friday.\u201d\n\nShe found out she was to play for Rachmaninoff one day when her father interrupted her practice to tell her she\u2019d be playing for the legendary pianist the following week. She recalled it being a Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI was as scared as I could be,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018I can\u2019t play for him,\u2019 but my father said, \u2018Well, you\u2019re going to,\u2019 and we went the next week to see him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs they approached Rachmaninoff\u2019s apartment in Paris, Slenczynska said she heard someone practicing the piano very slowly and thought, \u2018My goodness, this student isn\u2019t very good.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we rang the bell and the music suddenly stopped and I realized it was him,\u201d she said. \u201cThis very tall man opened the door and looked down at me. He pointed at me with his long finger and said, \u2018that plays the piano?\u2019\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nShe said she couldn\u2019t stop shaking as he summoned her and her father inside.\n\n\u201cHe wanted me to stop shaking, so he pulled a little paper from his pocket and drew me a picture of his boat,\u201d Slenczynska recalled. \u201cI started to laugh, picturing myself on this boat, and he then knew it was okay for me to play.\u201d\n\nRachmaninoff knew what it was like to be a child prodigy \u2014 his aristocratic mother had given him his first piano lesson at age 4. His famous Piano Concerto No. 2 was written when he was in his 20s.\n\nAt his apartment that day, Rachmaninoff asked Slenczynska to play one of her favorite pieces for him in a different key.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe piece was in E-flat major, and he asked me to play it in G-major,\u201d she said. \u201cThat meant I had to transpose. So very slowly, I did that. He then asked if I\u2019d played any of his music, and I told him no. I had thought he wrote only big concertos.\u201d\n\nRachmaninoff pulled out a pen and wrote \u201cPrelude in D Major, Op. 23, No. 4,\u201d on a piece of paper and handed it to her, she said.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Buy this music and play it for me next Wednesday,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I got my first lesson.\u201d\n\nFor the next two summers, she was Rachmaninoff\u2019s student, and she enjoyed tea and Russian cakes served by his niece after her lessons, Slenczynska said. Her famous teacher gave her a Faberg\u00e9 egg necklace, which she still wears in his honor.\n\nSlenczynska said Rachmaninoff taught her to think about how music related to the composer, and the importance of adding history and emotion to each piece.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was more than a teacher \u2014 he was a kind person, like a grandfather,\u201d she said.\n\nThe great piano maestro, who died in 1943, mentored and taught just a few students in his life, including Gina Bachauer, who died in 1976.\n\n\u201cI am now his only living student,\u201d Slenczynska said of Rachmaninoff. \u201cThat is something I never expected, but then, life never turns out the way you expect it to.\u201d\n\nWhen Slenczynska was 15, she said she fled her father\u2019s abuse and set out on her own. She stopped performing and studied music at the University of California, and in 1944 she met and married another student there, she said. They eventually divorced.\n\nIn 1954, Slenczynska resumed her concert career and accepted an artist-in-residence position at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, where she taught piano until 1987.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has performed for five U.S. presidents, including Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, John F. Kennedy, Herbert Hoover and Harry S. Truman, who was an amateur pianist, she said.\n\n\u201cPresident Truman called me to the White House and asked me to play a duet with him,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI really should have gotten a picture.\u201d\n\nWhile teaching in Illinois, Slenczynska married James Kerr, a professor of political science, in 1967. \u201cHe was the love of my life,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter Kerr\u2019s death in 2001, Slenczynska moved to New York City to teach students and judge piano competitions, she said. She remained there until August 2020 during the pandemic, when one of her former students \u2014 Pennsylvania pianist and music professor Shelly Moorman-Stahlman \u2014 persuaded Slenczynska to move in with her and her husband.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic was not a good time for elderly people to be out, and we live in a small community where she could safely continue her walks,\u201d Moorman-Stahlman said, adding that Slenczynska doesn\u2019t have children.\n\n\u201cRuth is a remarkable woman \u2014 she has a unique ability to always be looking forward,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have a lot of fun together, and she is still incredibly alert and gets around very well. She still insists on taking the stairs.\u201d\n\nAlthough she has retired from performing, Slenczynska said she enjoys listening to others play the piano and she will occasionally offer advice to promising students."}

Postolnikov, who was born in Russia and is the nephew of a longtime Russian government official, sold most of his stake just days after Trump\u2019s announcement sent the stock soaring, according to an FBI agent\u2019s search warrant affidavit. His profit: $22 million.\n\nAnother, a Ukraine-born nightclub manager turned private equity investor named Michael Shvartsman, told his business partners and a neighbor about the moneymaking opportunity, according to the affidavit \u2014 before securing $18 million in profits for himself.\n\nThose profits caught the attention of federal officials who launched a sprawling investigation into Digital World\u2019s investors, the details of which raise questions about how Trump, who built his political reputation in part on having mastered \u201cthe art of the deal,\u201d ended up committed to a business arrangement that federal agents now allege was undermined from its inception by financial fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump and Trump Media have not been accused of wrongdoing in the case. But Trump Media has been blocked from accessing the $300 million it expected to receive through the merger \u2014 money that it could use to build out Truth Social, Trump\u2019s main online megaphone, ahead of the November election.\n\nRejected by banks and lenders over the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and his long history of bankruptcies and business failures, Trump had approved the merger of his company with a special purpose acquisition company as a way to raise money in the months after he lost the White House. Often called \u201cblank check\u201d firms, SPACs promise access to public stock investors with fewer financial disclosures than a traditional corporate listing requires.\n\nTrump allies have claimed that the SEC\u2019s delay in approving the merger proves he\u2019s being persecuted by the Biden administration. But the cache of investigative documents, submitted as part of the pretrial discovery process ahead of a spring trial of those already charged, shows the investigation went far beyond the SEC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe documents detail the involvement of agents and investigators from the FBI, the SEC and Homeland Security Investigations, which is the division of the Department of Homeland Security dedicated to rooting out cross-border criminal activity and which includes one of the government\u2019s most elite anti-money-laundering teams. The documents suggest the investigation is ongoing.\n\nInvestigators used a microphone-wearing undercover informant to secretly record Shvartsman\u2019s attempts to move the profits \u2014 assets he told the informant he\u2019d gained from the \u201cs--- [that] happened with Trump\u201d \u2014 into a web of offshore accounts. The documents also claim Shvartsman offered to introduce the informant to an unnamed official in Ukraine who needed help moving a \u201csignificant amount of money.\u201d Whether officials pursued that tip is unknown.\n\nThe documents also reveal that FBI agents secretly tracked the holiday travel to Mexico of a Digital World board member so he could be intercepted on his return to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, where Customs and Border Protection officers commandeered his iPhone. While the board member waited for its return, the documents state, FBI agents covertly copied the phone\u2019s contents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hundreds of pages of documents include a previously sealed indictment, HSI reports detailing undercover operations, emails, text messages, transcripts of recorded conversations, prosecutors\u2019 memos summarizing evidence, and affidavits supporting search and seizure warrants for phones, digital data and bank accounts.\n\nAt a hearing in July, Nicolas Roos, an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York who has led some of his office\u2019s highest-profile cases, including the prosecutions of former Trump attorney Michael Cohen and cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, said prosecutors were in possession of roughly 2.5 million emails and other documents, as well as copies of several seized cellphones.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign referred comment for this story to Trump Media. Jesse Binnall, an attorney for Trump Media, said in a statement that the alleged wrongdoing \u201chad no connection to Trump Media whatsoever.\u201d Noting that Trump Media is suing The Washington Post over a previous story about the merger plans, Binnall warned that \u201cany allegations against Trump Media are maliciously and transparently false.\u201d He did not identify any specific reporting that he alleged to be false.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShvartsman, his brother Gerald, and Bruce Garelick, the investment chief of Shvartsman\u2019s private-equity firm Rocket One Capital, have been charged with conspiracy and securities fraud in the case.\n\nTai Park, an attorney for Shvartsman, said in a statement to The Post: \u201cAny suggestion of wrongdoing is flatly denied. He has [pleaded] not guilty and looks forward to the trial where we expect he will be vindicated.\u201d In a December court filing, Park said prosecutors had indicated new money-laundering charges could still be filed. Attorneys for Gerald Shvartsman and Garelick did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe SEC and Department of Homeland Security, which oversees HSI, declined to comment. The FBI referred comment to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, which also declined to comment.\n\nPostolnikov, Orlando, Digital World and Rocket One did not respond to requests for comment. Neither Postolnikov nor Orlando, who was terminated as Digital World\u2019s chief as the probe unfolded, has been charged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July, Digital World said it would pay $18 million if the merger goes through to settle SEC charges that it had misled investors and violated rules designed to counter fraud. Digital World said last month in an SEC filing that investigations by the SEC and Justice Department could \u201cdelay, materially impede, or prevent\u201d the merger.\n\nThe biggest financial losers from the insider-trading scheme, however, probably were early Digital World investors who believed in Trump\u2019s company enough to buy up shares in the hours after he announced the merger deal. In the days when the insiders were cashing out, Digital World\u2019s share price peaked at $175. Shares closed Friday at $40.60.\n\n\u2018Fearless entrepreneurs\u2019\n\nIn June 2021, the court filings say, Orlando went to meet with Shvartsman and other prospective investors at the Miami-area offices of Rocket One, a little-known private equity firm that had marketed itself on LinkedIn as investing in \u201cfearless entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShvartsman had helped run a nightclub in the 1990s in Edmonton, Alberta, called Kaos that local police alleged was financed by the Russian mob, a 2022 Financial Times report said \u2014 a claim Shvartsman denied, and for which he was never charged. He also founded Transact First, a company whose \u201ccashless ATMs\u201d help marijuana dispensaries transfer money from banks that would otherwise reject them as customers under federal law, according to a Bloomberg News report in 2022, which called him the \u201cgranddaddy\u201d of the \u201cmajor cashless ATM players.\u201d\n\nThe meeting came one month after Orlando had signed a registration statement filed with the SEC saying Digital World had not \u201cinitiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.\u201d\n\nBut messages included in an FBI affidavit indicate that Trump\u2019s company was part of the conversation in the meeting. In an email shortly afterward, Garelick wrote that he and Shvartsman had talked with Orlando about the \u201cfuture payment processing needs for the Trump Media Group.\u201d\n\nOne executive at Rocket One, Allen Beyer, told the firm\u2019s leaders after the meeting that he was underwhelmed, writing in a text message that Trump\u2019s last online venture, a blog, \u201cwas an embarrassment\u201d and that the idea of an app just for \u201cForever Trumpers\u201d would \u201cbe a bust,\u201d the affidavit said. \u201cWould you ever be associated with this as a \u2018founder\u2019 or anything in case it goes up in literal flames?\u201d Beyer wrote. He did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGarelick replied, however, that the investment came with \u201cdownside protection,\u201d the affidavit said. Garelick, Shvartsman and his brother, Gerald, who ran an outdoor-furniture store, invested enough to guarantee Garelick a seat on Digital World\u2019s board, the indictment said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe three men had signed confidentiality agreements before the meeting saying they would not trade on the inside information. But over the next few months, they bought up hundreds of thousands of dollars of Digital World shares and trading contracts, known as warrants, for small fractions of the price the shares would command once the deal was publicly disclosed.\n\nThe men also spoke with Postolnikov, another Miami-area entrepreneur who, like Shvartsman, was involved in the business of international payments. According to British financial records, Postolnikov owns a bank headquartered on the small Caribbean island of Dominica, called Paxum, that promotes itself as a financial conduit for online adult entertainment \u2014 an industry, like marijuana dispensaries, that banks traditionally have chosen to avoid.\n\nBorn in St. Petersburg, Postolnikov had in 2017 faced an arrest warrant in his hometown on charges of tax fraud, according to a court ruling obtained by The Post. That warrant, the ruling shows, was lifted in 2018, following the direct intervention of Russia\u2019s deputy prosecutor general, who said the case was without merit.\n\nBy 2021, Postolnikov, whose uncle, Aleksandr Smirnov, had served for most of the last two decades as a senior member of the Russian government, was saying in online profiles he lived in Miami Beach. In March 2021, he donated $30,000 to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s reelection campaign, campaign finance records show. A month later, according to Miami-Dade property records, a company he owns bought a $6 million condo on Fisher Island, a private island near Miami Beach once named \u201cAmerica\u2019s richest Zip code.\u201d\n\nIn June 2021, after the meeting with Orlando, Garelick wrote Postolnikov an email referring to some \u201cgood times last night,\u201d without details, and asked about his interest in investing in \u201cthat Trump Media Group SPAC we mentioned,\u201d the affidavit alleges.\n\nWhen Digital World announced its initial public offering in September 2021, it made no mention of Trump and said only that it intended to focus on \u201cmiddle market and emerging growth technology-focused companies in the Americas.\u201d But a day later, Postolnikov started buying hundreds of thousands of stock units and warrants in Digital World via a company called APLC Investments, a search warrant affidavit alleges.\n\nDuring that time, he also spoke on the phone \u201cregularly\u201d with Orlando and Gerald Shvartsman, according to an FBI agent\u2019s affidavit in support of a search warrant seeking emails and other data from their Apple and Google accounts.\n\nWithin hours of the Oct. 20, 2021, merger deal announcement, the price of Digital World\u2019s shares and warrants exploded. Shares first listed at $10 sold for prices as high as $175. And within days, the indictment said, all of the men had sold their shares for major profits, including $4.6 million for Gerald Shvartsman and $50,000 for Garelick.\n\nThe men celebrated with a few others they\u2019d told about the \u201cgood bet,\u201d including a neighbor, a friend and an employee, the records show. After his furniture store employee and the employee\u2019s father made $2 million in profits within two days of Trump Media\u2019s announcement, Gerald Shvartsman sent the employee a text message: \u201cI\u2019m happy for you. I\u2019ll be waiting for my commission,\u201d the records show.\n\nBut all stock market trades are monitored, and the frenzy of activity in an otherwise unremarkable SPAC just before its big kickoff attracted federal attention. By the end of October, a Digital World filing shows, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, an internal watchdog for the securities industry known as Finra, had started asking about the trades.\n\n\u2018Wash account\u2019\n\nOn the night of Dec. 31, 2021, Garelick had just landed at Kennedy Airport in New York after a vacation with his girlfriend to Canc\u00fan and Tulum when a customs agent told him he had been flagged for a secondary screening, according to a CBP inspection report filed in court.\n\nIn a backroom, two CBP officers began asking about his work with Digital World, saying they\u2019d looked him up online and thought he had an \u201cimpressive background,\u201d Garelick said in a court statement filed late last year. They also asked for his iPhone 11 Pro Max, plus the password to unlock it, assuring him it was all routine, he said.\n\nWhat Garelick didn\u2019t know is that two days earlier, a magistrate judge in Brooklyn had signed a warrant allowing FBI agents to search Garelick\u2019s phone and not tell anyone about it, a copy of the judge\u2019s ruling shows. While Garelick was waiting, an FBI agent took photos of his phone\u2019s text messages and a forensic examiner raced to make a full copy of its contents, a prosecutor\u2019s memo says.\n\nAround 9:30 p.m., after the inspection had gone on for an hour and 14 minutes, the agents ended the phone-data extraction early so as not to alert Garelick that he was under criminal investigation, the memo said. The border agents gave Garelick his phone back, and he went on his way.\n\nThe investigators weren\u2019t finished, however. In a search warrant affidavit, FBI agents said they were on the hunt for any information related to the relationships between Orlando, Postolnikov, the Shvartsman brothers and others who traded in Digital World stock.\n\nThey weren\u2019t the only ones interested in the case. SEC officials had one month earlier started asking Digital World about its investors\u2019 identities and its communications with Trump Media, an SEC filing shows. And a team of Miami agents specializing in illicit proceeds and foreign corruption inside HSI\u2019s El Dorado Task Force, which tracks financial crime, launched a joint effort alongside the FBI and SEC \u2014 code-named \u201cTrust Social\u201d \u2014 once they\u2019d realized they were pursuing \u201cthe same investigative targets,\u201d HSI said in a July 2023 report documenting the indictments filed in court.\n\nIn December 2021, more than $16 million had been moved from a Rocket One brokerage account into two OptimumBank accounts in Shvartsman\u2019s name, the indictment said. From there, the money was shuttled into a \u201cwash account\u201d that Shvartsman\u2019s company Transact First had used to transfer millions of dollars in a single day, an HSI agent said in an affidavit for a bank-account-seizure warrant later signed by a judge.\n\nThe account\u2019s \u201csheer volume of high-dollar transactions\u201d made it a \u201cconvenient tool to conceal the proceeds of illegal activity,\u201d according to the affidavit. Over the next several months, it alleged, millions of dollars filtered from that account into another bank account in Shvartsman\u2019s name.\n\nTrump Media later received a $2 million promissory note from a lender called ES Family Trust, Digital World said in an SEC filing last year. According to media reports, the trust\u2019s only named trustee, Angel Pacheco, says on LinkedIn he is also a director at Paxum, Postolnikov\u2019s bank.\n\nPacheco, who a Florida business record says is a co-manager with Shvartsman of a Miami company called Foundation Card Services, did not respond to requests for comment. The owner of an email address for the trust has not responded to questions about where the money came from.\n\n\u2018Fetish for superyachts\u2019\n\nOne afternoon in December 2022, Shvartsman met with a specialist at a Marriott hotel near Miami International Airport to discuss what his lawyer would later describe in a court declaration as his \u201cinterest in asset protection.\u201d\n\nShvartsman told the man he needed help, due to the \u201crecent Russian related sanctions,\u201d in moving some of his assets \u2014 which included \u201csome real estate, a small amount of cash (described as \u2018a few million bucks\u2019) and a yacht\u201d \u2014 into a company he intended to create in Belize, according to an HSI investigative report in the \u201cTrust Social\u201d case filed with the court.\n\nThe specialist, though, was actually a government informant wearing a hidden microphone, according to HSI investigative reports, which refer to him only as \u201cSA-2894-MI.\u201d And after Shvartsman asked for his assistance in setting up new bank accounts, perhaps in Switzerland or Western Europe, the informant told Shvartsman he would be happy to help \u2014 in exchange for a fee \u201cabove the typical rate.\u201d\n\nOver the next several months, the informant and Shvartsman met regularly to hash out a plan for how the informant could shuttle Shvartsman\u2019s assets around the globe, according to the government\u2019s transcripts of the conversations filed in court. The records do not detail how the informant was introduced to Shvartsman or where he lived, though he signed off after one call saying he was in \u201cBritish Summer Time.\u201d\n\nThe secretly recorded meetings featured moments of tension. During one March 2023 meeting inside a Rocket One office north of Miami, Shvartsman signed documents to move his assets into an offshore trust and then warned he would \u201chave to kill\u201d the informant if the man tampered with Shvartsman\u2019s fortune, according to the government\u2019s transcript of the meeting.\n\nWhen the informant told another man in the room, \u201cThat\u2019s the second time he said he\u2019s going to kill me,\u201d Shvartsman responded, \u201cI don\u2019t f--- around,\u201d the transcript states.\n\nBut the conversations also showed the men getting to know each other. During the March meeting, Shvartsman said the main reason he wanted to move his assets was \u201cthe ordeal with \u2018Trump\u2019\u201d and his \u201cdesire to not have the funds acquired from that investment taken from him,\u201d according to a \u201cdebriefing\u201d statement from the informant included in the HSI report filed with the court. Shvartsman\u2019s attorney also told the informant then that his client was \u201cyour classic serial entrepreneur\u201d and had a \u201cfetish for superyachts,\u201d according to the government\u2019s transcript.\n\nDuring the meetings, Shvartsman offered to introduce the informant to new clients, saying he knew a Russian-speaking \u201chigh-ranking Army or military officer\u201d in Ukraine who needed help moving a \u201csignificant amount of money,\u201d according to a transcript detailing what the informant told agents after one April 2023 lunch. \u201cThere\u2019s guys in the Ukraine sitting on a lot of cash,\u201d Shvartsman told the informant in another meeting, according to the government\u2019s transcript.\n\nBut he also extended to the informant his own connections, saying he had a Russian friend who lived on Fisher Island and owned a bank in Dominica that could provide banking services to Russian, Chinese or Ukrainian individuals facing \u201csanction issues\u201d or other financial restrictions, the government\u2019s transcript shows.\n\n\u201cWe do a lot of business together. He\u2019s a very good friend of mine,\u201d Shvartsman said, according to the transcript. In the version of the HSI report filed in court, the friend\u2019s name is redacted.\n\n\u2018No Russians\u2019\n\nOne morning in June 2023, four FBI agents, two HSI agents and officers from the local police showed up at Shvartsman\u2019s home in the Miami suburb of Sunny Isles Beach with a warrant for his arrest. Two other arrest teams nabbed his brother and Garelick at their homes in nearby Aventura and Fort Lauderdale, a Justice Department filing said.\n\nIn the HSI report from July documenting the arrests, agents said all three men had \u201cties to Ukraine and Russian Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs),\u201d a term for prominent officials believed to be vulnerable to bribery or corruption. A Justice Department statement said the men faced up to seven counts of conspiracy and securities fraud, with maximum sentences of 90 to 130 years in prison.\n\nBut Shvartsman\u2019s talks with the informant didn\u2019t stop.\n\nIn July 2023, a week after he pleaded not guilty in a New York courtroom, he met with the informant to ask about the status of his asset transfers, the government\u2019s transcript of their meeting shows. The informant assured him that his assets were in the process of moving from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom and then to Belize, according to the transcript \u2014 \u201cthe full Singapore with a double dip, as we call it, with having the U.K. thrown in there, just to give it that added cleanliness and polishing off,\u201d he said.\n\nThe men also discussed whom Shvartsman wanted to nominate as the ostensible leaders of the local shell companies \u2014 \u201cno Russians,\u201d the informant confirmed \u2014 and proposed a crew that, at one point, included \u201ctwo Ukrainians, a Canadian and a Bulgarian,\u201d the transcript states. The assets\u2019 spin through Hong Kong, the informant said, would ensure they stayed \u201cout of reach of the U.S. government because, you know, it\u2019s China, basically,\u201d according to the transcript. \u201cThat is the big washing machine.\u201d\n\nIn August, Shvartsman and the informant went to Carpaccio, a restaurant in the wealthy Miami Beach enclave of Bal Harbour, for what was perhaps their last secretly recorded lunch, according to the government\u2019s transcript of the meeting.\n\nShvartsman pushed for details on the \u201cfull Singapore\u201d process and a Swiss bank account. And the men agreed on a system of code words that Shvartsman could use, once the money was sheltered, to secretly send messages to the informant\u2019s operatives over the phone: a \u201cgreen\u201d code to approve a transaction, and a \u201cred\u201d code if Shvartsman was facing an emergency or under investigative duress.\n\nThe \u201cgreen\u201d phrase was \u201cHow\u2019s your girlfriend, Alexandra?\u201d a transcript shows. Asked for a \u201cred\u201d phrase, Shvartsman responded, \u201cAnything else.\u201d\n\nIn November, a magistrate judge signed a warrant authorizing the seizure of Shvartsman\u2019s bank account. A federal agent said the account contained roughly $15 million, though bank records cited in the seizure-warrant affidavit said it had reached as high as $44 million the month before."}

Gathered at Erin\u2019s Albuquerque home, they saw the squares on the computer screen filled by Gail DeCosta, 75, in Charleston, S.C.; Vicki Davis Williams, 73, also in Charleston; and Williams\u2019s sister Julia-Ellen Craft Davis, 74, who logged in from her daughter\u2019s home in New Jersey.\n\nFor two hours, they tried to answer a question that historians have long debated: Are they, in fact, cousins?\n\nWilliams and Davis and their first cousin, Gail, are great-great-grandchildren of William and Ellen Craft, a couple who achieved world renown for their dramatic escape from slavery in Georgia in 1848. Ellen, who was light-complexioned, disguised herself as a Southern gentleman traveling north with William, \u201chis\u201d enslaved servant. The Crafts became active abolitionists in the North, ultimately settling in England to avoid recapture under the Fugitive Slave Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartha Healy, Tom Riley\u2019s great-grandmother, fled the same region of Georgia during the same era as the Crafts. Martha\u2019s mother, Mary Eliza, was the common-law wife of her enslaver, Michael Healy, a major Jones County landowner. Georgia law prohibited Healy from freeing his wife and children, so Healy sent his children north, both to liberate them and to educate them.\n\nThe Healy children would become the first known African American Catholic bishop, university president, Mother Superior and captain of a U.S. government ship. The Healys, who could pass for White, did not acknowledge their African heritage.\n\n\u201cOur side of the family was seriously passing right through my grandmother\u2019s generation,\u201d said Riley on the Zoom call. Riley was brought up White and Irish Catholic outside of Boston. Williams, Davis and DeCosta have always identified as Black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis Zoom call, arranged by The Washington Post, may mark the first time these families have met in about 150 years. It also coincided with the 175th anniversary of the Crafts\u2019 escape from Georgia at Christmas, a time when some enslavers granted passes to allow enslaved workers to leave their estates for the holiday.\n\nThe call was not marked by the usual mirth that accompanies a family reunion. These cousins \u2013 or likely cousins \u2014 were strangers, warm and cordial, but mostly curious to find out whether the other family had passed down any stories that suggested the blood relationship established by historians.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any family stories on our side of it,\u201d Riley said on the call.\n\nMartha, Riley\u2019s great-grandmother, was one of six Healy siblings who chose a life of devotion within the Catholic Church, before she left the convent to marry. While the family\u2019s African American heritage had long been the stuff of rumor among clerics and the congregations to which the Healys ministered, it was Albert S. Foley, a Jesuit priest and historian, who publicized the family secret in \u201cBeloved Outcaste,\u201d his 1954 book about Martha\u2019s brother, James Healy, bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland, Maine, from 1875 to 1900 and the first Black priest in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI remember Father Foley coming to the house,\u201d said Riley, who was 8 when his grandmother reluctantly granted an interview to the meddlesome priest in her Waltham, Mass., home. Riley was left in the dark until an aunt told him at 16 about his mixed-race heritage.\n\nFoley made no mention of the Crafts in his 1954 book, but in \u201cDream of an Outcaste,\u201d his 1976 book on the bishop\u2019s brother, Patrick \u2014 president from 1873 to 1882 of Georgetown University, whose flagship building bears his name \u2014 Foley asserted that Mary Eliza, the clerics\u2019 mother, was a sister to the famed abolitionist Ellen Craft. The journalist and historian Dorothy Sterling repeated the claim in her 1979 book \u201cBlack Foremothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went deep down the Sterling and Foley rabbit hole,\u201d said Ilyon Woo, author of \u201cMaster Slave Husband Wife,\u201d her 2023 bestseller on the Crafts. Woo had drafted an entire chapter on Mary Eliza but abandoned it when she could not verify Foley\u2019s claim that she was Ellen\u2019s sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Foley and Sterling] clearly did an incredible amount of really obsessive research, [but] they were horrible footnoters,\u201d Woo said. Still, she sensed, \u201cThey never said anything that they didn\u2019t feel like they could back up.\u201d She went in search of their elusive sources.\n\nAt the Josephite Archives in D.C., which housed some of Foley\u2019s papers, she learned that the relevant box of documents had been thrown out. In Harvard\u2019s Houghton Library, she found a handwritten 1893 letter from S.T. Pickard, the editor of the Portland Transcript, to a historian chronicling Maine\u2019s Underground Railroad. Pickard said he had met Ellen when she visited the home of Portland abolitionist Lydia Dennett, then wrote:\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cThe Roman Catholic Bishop of this Diocese, Bishop Healy, is her cousin. \u2026 I doubt if it would do to publish these facts, for Healy does not acknowledge them. But Ellen Crafts (sic) told me it was so \u2014 and she called on him and was recognized.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPickard repeated that claim in an 1895 letter, specifying that Ellen was Healy\u2019s \u201cfirst cousin.\u201d\n\nThat would make Mary Eliza the aunt of Ellen and not her sister, as Foley and Sterling had declared.\n\nWhat ultimately gave Woo the confidence to state in her book that Mary Eliza was Ellen\u2019s aunt were the materials she discovered at the Craft family archive at the Avery Research Center at the College of Charleston, which suggested a family relationship.\n\n\u201cIt just comes up again and again,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2011, Davis and Williams donated to Avery a photo album that Ellen Craft started in England. Captions reading \u201cBishop James A. Healy\u201d and \u201cRev. Sherwood Healy,\u201d indicate where photographs of the Healys once appeared among the cartes des visites of Frederick Douglass, Harriet Martineau and other luminaries the Crafts knew.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulia Ellen Craft DeCosta, the grandmother of Davis, Williams and DeCosta, had been the custodian of that album. She, along with Davis\u2019s and Williams\u2019s mother, visited Bishop Healy\u2019s burial place in Portland around 1977, Davis told the Rileys.\n\n\u201cWhy would they do that,\u201d Riley wondered aloud, if they were not related?\n\nA few weeks after the call, Williams shared a picture of her mother and grandmother at Healy\u2019s grave site, featuring a towering stone Celtic cross.\n\nWilliam and Ellen Craft themselves may have cryptically referred to the Healys in their 1860 book, \u201cRunning a Thousand Miles for Freedom.\u201d They devote 10 pages to a story of \u201ca very humane and wealthy gentleman, that bought a woman, with whom he lived as his wife.\u201d This Jones County couple \u201cbrought up a family of children, among whom were three nearly white, well educated, and beautiful girls.\u201d That describes Martha and her siblings exactly. While the story departs from the Healy history in some key respects, William, whose voice the book adopts, announces at the end of this story that the enslaved woman he described was \u201cmy wife\u2019s own dear aunt.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt seems pretty likely their story was an embroidered version of the Healy story,\u201d said Woo, noting that sharing the full story would have blown the Healys\u2019 cover, as they were passing for White. It could have also complicated the book\u2019s anti-slavery narrative, since the Healy children, as beneficiaries of their father\u2019s estate, profited from the labor and eventual sale of their father\u2019s enslaved workers after his death.\n\n\u201cYou know, a DNA test would help a whole lot with some of this,\u201d Davis told the Rileys on Zoom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to do it,\u201d Tom Riley said. \u201cAnd just sort of see where we are connected.\u201d\n\nDNA testing may confirm the two families are related. But it\u2019s unlikely to provide definitive answers about how Ellen and Mary Eliza were related and who the families\u2019 common ancestor is.\n\n\u201cWe have the gift of DNA [testing] but it can also be confounding,\u201d said Mary Helen Thomspon, a volunteer genealogical researcher at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. DNA results, she said, can tell us only so much, if there is no other context, like a family tree. Even then, the accepted family history may mask the true story, given how often official records and family documents did not acknowledge children of White men and enslaved women. In the absence of trustworthy records, she said, \u201coral history counts for a great deal.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErin Riley wondered if their family connection might prove too remote. She asked the group on Zoom, \u201cWould Ancestry do it? Is it powerful enough genetics?\u201d\n\nDavis responded that a test would still probably register shared DNA. She did an AncestryDNA test more than a decade ago, and it confirmed that she, Williams and DeCosta had third cousins in England, descendants of the Crafts\u2019 son William Ivins Craft, who returned to England after the Crafts came back to the United States. Williams held up a picture for the Rileys of Davis, DeCosta and herself with their British cousins at a UK reunion.\n\n\u201cThey are, for all appearances, White,\u201d DeCosta told the Rileys, the result of generations of intermarriage with White Britons. When DeCosta and her first cousins visited the U.K. in 2022, a couple of their British cousins said they had not been aware of their ancestry until they were adults. \u201cIt had not been shared with them.\u201d"}

But in Coruche, a rural area south of the Tagus River known as Portugal\u2019s \u201ccork capital,\u201d the bang of trees falling to the ground doesn\u2019t follow the sound of the ax strokes. Instead, experienced workers carefully peel away the bark from the tree trunks.\n\nThis annual rite of extracting cork in the summer months has been around for thousands of years in the western Mediterranean. Egyptians, Persians, Greeks and Romans used the material to make fishing gear, sandals and to seal jugs, jars and barrels. As glass bottles gained popularity in the 18th century, cork became the preferred sealant because it is durable, waterproof, light and pliable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow cork is experiencing a revival as more industries look for sustainable alternatives to plastic and other materials derived from fossil fuels. The bark is now used for flooring and furniture, to make shoes and clothes and as insulation in homes and electric cars. Portugal\u2019s exports reached an all-time high of 670 million euro ($728 million) in the first half of 2023.\n\nBut cork is more than a trendy green material. In addition to jobs, the forests where it grows provide food and shelter for animals, all while sequestering carbon dioxide. And unlike most trees grown commercially, cork oaks are never cut down, meaning their carbon storage capacity continues through the 200 years or more they live.\n\nHow cork is harvested\n\nWith a firm swing, Fernando Tacha strikes the trunk of a cork oak, then twists his ax and uses the handle to delicately prise the plank.\n\n\u201cI started cutting cork when I was only 19. Now I\u2019m 69. But I will do this as long as I can,\u201d he says as he wipes the sweat from his forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard job, but a beautiful one.\u201d\n\nA low, slow-growing evergreen tree, the cork oak is endemic to the Mediterranean. The most extensive forests can be found on the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula. In Portugal, the world\u2019s largest cork producer, the oaks are so cherished they were chosen as the country\u2019s national tree and are protected by law, so it\u2019s forbidden to cut them. Spain is the second-largest producer, followed by Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Italy and France.\n\nThe process of harvesting cork takes precision and years of practice. The stroke of the ax must be strong, but also delicate to avoid hitting the inner bark and damaging the tree. Because it is so specialized, it\u2019s one of the best paying agricultural jobs in Portugal.\n\nThe bark can only be harvested between late May and August, when the tree is in its active phase of growth, which makes it easier to strip the outer layer without damaging the tree trunk.\n\nThe cork oak is unique in its ability to regenerate its bark. Once it is removed, workers write the last number of that year with white paint on the exposed golden brown trunk \u2014 a three means it was harvested in 2023. The bark will slowly grow back and be ready for another harvest after nine years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaula Salgueira, who has been working in the cork harvest in Coruche for 35 years, extends her hand to touch an oak that was just stripped. \u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d she says as she caresses the smooth denuded trunk. While axmen work in pairs removing the cork, Salgueira and a few other women gather the planks in piles for transportation.\n\nThe planks will then be stacked outdoors in storage areas exposed to air and sunlight. After six months of aging to remove moisture, they will be sorted according to their thickness and quality, then boiled to clean impurities and make the material softer and easier to handle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom bottle stopper to green material\n\nWhile most cork is still used for bottle stoppers, over the last decade different industries have been finding new uses for it.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a growing interest in cork as a sustainable material,\u201d says Rui Novais, a materials expert at the University of Aveiro in Portugal. \u201cCompared with materials like polyurethane foam [used for thermal insulation], products made with cork require less energy and produce less CO2 emissions.\u201d\n\nThe cork oak\u2019s thick bark adapted to defend the tree from fire, making it a powerful insulating material that\u2019s been used to shield fuel tanks on NASA spacecraft and electric car batteries. It\u2019s also resistant to water and oil, and can withstand compression while retaining springiness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary, renewable and biodegradable material,\u201d says Novais. \u201cIt\u2019s also very durable. It has been demonstrated that cork products remain virtually unchanged for more than 50 years.\u201d\n\nPart of the carbon absorbed by cork oak trees is transferred to cork products, which can be used for long periods, repurposed and recycled. Several studies found that cork is carbon negative, meaning it can store more carbon than what is required to produce it.\n\nWhen cork planks are trimmed and punched to form natural cork stoppers, the leftovers are ground into granules and pressed together to form cork sheets or blocks. \u201cEven cork dust is used to produce energy,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Rui Ferreira, secretary general of the Portuguese Cork Association. \u201cIt feeds the industry\u2019s boilers and powers some of the production.\u201d\n\nRecycled cork can also be crushed and composited to make other products. In Portugal, Green Cork, a recycling program started by the environmental organization Quercus, has collected and recycled more than 100 million cork stoppers since 2009. A similar initiative, ReCORK, exists in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA natural factory\n\nMost of the cork produced in Portugal grows in the gently undulating hills and plains in the south of the country, in an ancient agroforestry system known as montado. This savannah-like ecosystem combines cork, holm oaks and olive trees with pastures, grazing livestock, crops and fallows.\n\n\u201cThe soil in southern Portugal is very poor, there is very little rain and temperatures are very high in the summer,\u201d says Teresa Pinto-Correia, a professor at the University of \u00c9vora in Portugal specializing in rural landscapes and agricultural systems. \u201cBut this kind of system is productive even when resources are scarce and conditions are difficult.\u201d\n\nFor centuries, locals have preserved the montado because cork provided landowners with a source of income. This mosaic of habitats supports hundreds of species, including the Iberian lynx, the world\u2019s most endangered wildcat, and the threatened Imperial eagle. One of the world\u2019s oldest known cork oak trees, planted in 1783 in \u00c1guas de Moura, is known as \u201cthe whistler\u201d because so many birds visit its large sprawling branches.\n\nIberian pigs feed on acorns and goats graze the interwoven pastures. Interspersing cork oak trees with animals and crops can boost production and biodiversity, but also build soil, control erosion, retain water, combat desertification and sequester carbon, says Pinto-Correia.\n\nWhile the cork forests can help mitigate the effects of climate change, they are also increasingly at risk from it as drought and wildfires become more intense and more frequent in the region.\n\n\u201cThe tree is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. The bark protects it from fire,\u201d says forest engineer Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Santos Silva. \u201cBut for the first two years after cork is extracted, the trees are much more vulnerable to wildfires because they don\u2019t have this protection.\u201d\n\nYet fires in cork groves, she says, remain rare because of careful human management. \u201cThe tree always regenerates,\u201d says Santos Silva.\n\nAs a slow-growing tree, the cork oak takes decades to provide shade and produce good quality cork. But in Coruche, people still go by an old Portuguese saying: \u201cThose who care about their grandchildren plant cork oak trees.\u201d"}

The Michigan State guard shadowed the nation\u2019s leading scorer, denying the Iowa guard the ball before getting turned around for a split second. The tiny bit of space allowed Clark to catch a pass from a teammate with a second left and hit a game-winning, step-back three-pointer from the edge of that Hawkeyes logo even though Joiner recovered in time to get a hand in her face.\n\nIn a game this week, Northwestern blitzed Clark with a double team that nearly trapped her along the sideline near midcourt with the clock ticking down, but she whipped an overhand hook pass to teammate Hannah Stuelke for a layup.\n\nThey were similar situations against the clock, with the opponent employing different defensive approaches that pushed Clark near half court, and she still made the play each time. Welcome to the challenge of trying to guard the woman Michigan State Coach Robyn Fralick called \u201cthe most dynamic player in the history of college women\u2019s basketball.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou guard her when she gets off the bus in the parking lot. You start there,\u201d ESPN and Big Ten Network analyst Meghan McKeown said. \u201cI\u2019m doing the Michigan State game, [and] everybody in the gym knows the ball\u2019s going to her. Everybody. And she still creates enough separation to get the shot off.\u201d\n\nMaryland is the next team that will try to slow Clark when it hosts No. 3 Iowa on Saturday night in the most anticipated game of the year at Xfinity Center \u2014 and it\u2019s not coming at a good time for the Terrapins. Maryland is on a three-game losing streak, and its best defender and overall player, Shyanne Sellers, is day-to-day with a knee injury.\n\nClark leads the country with 32.1 points per game, more than six points better than Southern California\u2019s JuJu Watkins, who ranks second. In 122 career games, Clark has been held to single digits just once \u2014 as a freshman on Jan. 9, 2021, at Northwestern. She has been held under 20 points just 15 times \u2014 not once this season. Against Northwestern this week, she became the No. 2 all-time scorer in the sport\u2019s history behind Kelsey Plum, now a two-time WNBA champion with the Las Vegas Aces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnowing all of that, the Terps should have at least a modicum of confidence after some past success against Clark\u2019s Hawkeyes. Two of her sub-20-point games have come against Maryland, and the Terps\u2019 96-68 victory last February was one of the best defensive efforts Clark has faced in her career. She was held to 18 points on 5-for-13 shooting with six turnovers as Maryland used a box-and-one defense to stifle her.\n\nMaryland is 4-2 against Iowa with Clark on the floor, but this particular Maryland roster doesn\u2019t have the same talent and athleticism that allowed the Terps to be so creative defensively last season.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s even better than she was a year ago,\u201d Maryland Coach Brenda Frese said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to stop her. You\u2019re not going to limit her. You just have to make her have to work for the points that she\u2019s going to earn.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question becomes how to keep Clark close to 20 points instead of 35, which she has reached or surpassed 26 times in her career, including in each of her past three games.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nConnecticut Sun Coach Stephanie White, who is calling Saturday\u2019s nationally televised game for Fox, said it\u2019s a pick-your-poison situation. Opponents can either let Clark \u201cgo crazy\u201d and try to contain everyone else, or they can try to get the ball out of her hands with multiple defenders and live with open shots from her teammates. Additionally, those multiple defenders have to deploy in different ways because Clark\u2019s high basketball IQ will allow her to read and adjust if she sees the same look over and over.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is, you\u2019ve got to commit to one of those things or the other,\u201d White said. \u201cAnd throughout the course of the game, you\u2019ve got to give them a lot of different looks. But she\u2019s improved so much in her reading and her ability to get her teammates really good shots and be more than just a scorer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nESPN analyst Carolyn Peck, who coached Purdue to the 1999 national championship, mentioned scenarios such as the Michigan State ending. If teams get the ball out of Clark\u2019s hands, they cannot let her get it back. Peck said she would aggressively trap every ball screen. She referenced last season\u2019s national championship game and credited former LSU guard Alexis Morris for sitting on Clark\u2019s left hand and forcing her to go right \u2014 even if Clark did finish with 30 points and eight assists in the Hawkeyes\u2019 102-85 loss.\n\n\u201cHer dribble pull-up to the left is all but automatic,\u201d Peck said. \u201cSo I say force her right and bring that help there. \u2026 You want to make her a passer.\n\n\u201cMake somebody else the leading scorer that doesn\u2019t have the initials C.C.\u201d\n\nIowa is the top-scoring team in the nation at 91.8 points per game, and Clark, predictably, thrives in transition. Her scoring ability is obvious because she can get to the rim or pull up for deep threes, but she also is a skilled distributor with the vision and feel to set up her teammates with long outlets or precision passes. Letting Clark and Iowa get up and down the floor quickly is a quick and easy way to get carved up.

Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend. ArrowRight \u201cI want a response from Norfolk Southern that we can look back five years from now, 10 years from now, [and] we can be proud,\u201d Alan Shaw, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview with local reporters in January.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s capital, however, Norfolk Southern often has sounded a more defiant note: It has joined some of the nation\u2019s leading freight railroads in a bid to weaken newly proposed safety legislation, threatening to leave millions of Americans nationwide at risk of deadly derailments and dangerous chemical spills.\n\nThe target of the lobbying is a bipartisan proposal from Ohio\u2019s two senators: Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, and J.D. Vance, a Republican. Unveiled last spring as a direct response to the accident in East Palestine, the Railway Safety Act aims to toughen rail inspections, improve derailment-detection technology and ensure greater safeguards for hazardous materials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPublicly, Norfolk Southern and its peers have pledged to work with lawmakers on the bill. But the companies have still labored to severely weaken or eliminate some of its core provisions, according to 15 lawmakers, congressional aides, union officials and others, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.\n\n\u201cThey will often say the right things, but then through their actions, and especially through their lobbying, move in a different direction,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a recent interview.\n\nOver the past year, the nation\u2019s five largest rail operators together spent roughly $17 million to lobby lawmakers, while donating generously to key members of Congress who oversee transportation issues, according to federal records. Some of the chief beneficiaries of industry cash were Republicans, who initially attacked the Biden administration over its handling of the East Palestine derailment before opposing or slowing down safety legislation.\n\nIn doing so, rail industry lobbyists also fought the Biden administration on even the most basic upgrades, from efforts to ensure that engineers have special breathing equipment onboard to new rules that would require miles-long trains to be staffed with more than one person. The staunch opposition has bogged down some federal action while leaving Congress unable to hold a single vote on rail safety legislation in the House or Senate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor 150 years, the rail industry has been one of the most powerful industries in the country,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey have spent tens of millions of dollars lobbying. It\u2019s what they do. They\u2019re very good at it. We forgot how powerful they were.\u201d\n\nShaw, the chief executive of Norfolk Southern, declined to be interviewed. The company said it has already altered some of its practices since the accident, including by improving crash detection, training first responders and supplying them with more information about a freight train\u2019s contents. On Monday, it became the first major freight railroad to participate in a new system that allows employees to report safety issues confidentially to the U.S. government. Other companies have failed to follow suit, even after pledging to participate last year.\n\n\u201cOur industry can make rail even safer, but it will take railroads, car owners and manufacturers, and our customers,\u201d Shaw said in a statement. \u201cFrom day one, I\u2019ve shared these views directly with our elected leaders. I see a real opportunity for us to advance policies that will prevent accidents and improve collaboration with first responders.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve literally given them a road map\u2019\n\nFor Washington, the inability to address rail safety exemplifies the persistent gridlock on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers struggle mightily to fulfill the most basic functions of government, even in the face of crisis. Once, a major chemical spill \u2014 and the risk of huge losses of life or property \u2014 would have motivated Congress to act with haste. Now, legislators can\u2019t even debate the most pressing issues, stymied often by partisan warfare and corporate influence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe political dysfunction has offered no comfort to the roughly 4,700 residents of East Palestine, a town near the Pennsylvania border crisscrossed by freight lines. On Feb. 3, 2023, some of the wheels on a Norfolk Southern freight train totaling about 150 cars caught fire and skipped off the tracks, spilling the train\u2019s contents, including vinyl chloride, which can cause cancer. As residents and businesses evacuated, government officials scrambled to figure out the extent and risks of the contamination, leading to a controversial decision to burn off chemicals.\n\nOne year later, \u201croughly 90 to 95 percent of it is cleaned up,\u201d said Trent Conaway, the mayor of East Palestine, though there remain \u201chot spots\u201d and officials continue to test the soil. State leaders have helped compensate affected families and businesses \u2014 and Norfolk Southern provided limited temporary housing \u2014 though Conaway says the total economic losses to the town would \u201cdefinitely be in the millions.\u201d\n\nThe derailment sparked federal investigations, including a review by the National Transportation Safety Board. Its chair, Jennifer Homendy, said in an interview last month that she anticipates releasing a final review of the accident \u2014 along with recommendations for changes \u2014 in May or June. President Biden, for his part, announced Wednesday that he plans to visit East Palestine in the coming weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore federal officials could complete their probes, however, the images of fiery rail cars in Ohio prompted the Biden administration to ramp up its work on safety, while Congress pursued new legislation. Last March, Brown and Vance settled on the Railway Safety Act, which Vance portrayed at the time as a \u201creal opportunity to ensure that what happened in East Palestine will never happen again.\u201d (His office declined to comment for this article.)\n\nThe proposal coupled new track and crew requirements with heightened powers for federal regulators to investigate and penalize any abuses. At the moment, the U.S. government can only fine rail operators up to about $225,000 for some spill-related accidents, even those that result in death.\n\nShaw called the proposal the \u201cfirst step toward the ultimate goal of enacting bipartisan legislation,\u201d adding that Norfolk Southern would be \u201ccontinuing our engagement\u201d with Congress. But his pledge foreshadowed a wide-ranging industry lobbying campaign to neuter the bill and some of its toughest provisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorfolk Southern soon banded together with its counterparts, including BNSF Railway, CSX and Union Pacific, to challenge core provisions of the measure that aimed to remedy the safety lapses in East Palestine. One proposal required rail operators to place more sensors on tracks \u2014 with shorter gaps between them \u2014 to better monitor the temperature of wheels to detect derailment risk. Currently, no federal law governs the use of these sensors or where they should be placed, even though rail safety experts broadly see the technology as critical to spotting potential fires.\n\nIn private meetings, lobbyists for the Association for American Railroads, a Washington-based lobbying group, griped about the government trying to set these rules, according to four congressional aides. The organization, which represents Norfolk Southern and the rest of the industry, told Brown\u2019s staff in April that freight railroads could determine on their own if their existing systems to detect wheel temperature and other defects were operating sufficiently.\n\nAs the Senate took its first steps to consider the bill, the association ramped up its opposition, faulting Congress in May for trying to \u201cmicromanage detector networks.\u201d The group\u2019s president, Ian Jefferies, later told lawmakers at a hearing about the crash that they should be \u201cwary of proposals motivated by politics.\u201d\n\nInstead, the rail association pitched Congress on a plan for rail operators to continue regulating themselves. In an interview, Jefferies pointed to industry efforts to install more track sensors since the East Palestine derailment.\n\n\u201cThe sole reason there\u2019s a nationwide network of wayside detection devices, a variety of types \u2026 is because railroads see a need. That was not because Congress, or because the federal government, the Department of Transportation, mandated that,\u201d Jefferies added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the commitments offered no comfort to rail workers, safety experts and some lawmakers, many of whom saw the East Palestine derailment as a clear signal that the industry had failed to govern itself. Before the Ohio accident, the NTSB had already issued about 190 rail-related safety recommendations that remain open or resolved in unsatisfactory ways, according to the agency.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve literally given them a road map for how to improve safety, and they haven\u2019t done so,\u201d said Homendy, the NTSB chair.\n\nNationally, there were more than 289 derailments and other accidents on main freight lines from Jan. 1 to Nov. 30, according to a Washington Post review of the most recently available federal transportation data. The tally marked an uptick from the previous year, though Jefferies maintained that rail is the \u201csafest way to move cargo over land, and that\u2019s especially true\u201d for hazardous materials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA failed wheel bearing on a CSX freight train caused a chemical fire near Livingston, Ky., for example, forcing some to evacuate their homes on Thanksgiving. Two BNSF trains derailed on the same day in March \u2014 one in Arizona, another in Washington state \u2014 with the latter spilling thousands of gallons of diesel fuel onto tribal lands.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nKendall Kirkham Sloan, a spokeswoman for BNSF, pointed to company-supplied data indicating it had the \u201clowest injury frequency rate\u201d in 2023. In a statement, she said the freight railroad would \u201ccontinue to share our concerns about policy provisions that are not tailored to address specifically identified safety concerns.\u201d\n\nThe assurances failed to satisfy lawmakers in Congress.\n\n\u201cI do not trust these railroads to regulate themselves,\u201d said Rep. Chris Deluzio (D), whose Pennsylvania district borders East Palestine. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in seeing them pay lip service to safety.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Darlington, Pa., which Deluzio represents, the contamination from the East Palestine derailment last February forced some residents and businesses to evacuate. In March, he introduced his own version of the Railway Safety Act in the House \u2014 prompting a visit two months later from Norfolk Southern\u2019s top executive.\n\nShaw laid out his objections to critical portions of the bill, according to Deluzio, who said the rail operator objected to a proposal to institute new inspection and safety requirements for the sort of hazardous materials that spilled in East Palestine. Recalling the conversation last month, Deluzio said he made \u201ccrystal clear they should not only be opposing my bill and others, but they should be supporting it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they tried to lobby me too hard,\u201d the congressman added. \u201cI suspect they\u2019re talking to folks who are a little friendlier.\u201d\n\n\u2018Burdensome regulations and all this other stuff\u2019\n\nTo recruit allies, the rail industry long has relied on its political checkbook: The largest companies and their lobbying groups have spent a combined, roughly $327 million in lobbying since 2010, according to a Post analysis of federal spending records.\n\nThis election cycle, the industry and its workers have also contributed more than $4.3 million to federal candidates and party committees, donor records show. Much of the money has gone to Republicans, especially those who oversee federal transportation policy.\n\nTwo of the biggest beneficiaries in the 2024 contests have been Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the leader of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Rep. Troy E. Nehls (R-Tex.), who oversees its rail-focused subcommittee. In this cycle, Graves has received $26,000 from BNSF, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific and their top trade association, while Nehls has received about $19,000. The companies donated through their political action committees to the two lawmakers as well as their leadership PACs, which enable members of Congress to write checks to their peers.\n\nIn the weeks after the East Palestine derailment, Graves, Nehls and other Republicans hammered the Biden administration. That March, they wrote federal regulators to raise \u201csignificant concerns\u201d and to question \u201cwhether appropriate actions have been taken by the federal agencies to protect the community and the environment.\u201d\n\nSince then, though, the two lawmakers have refused to hold legislative hearings on the bipartisan rail safety bill, preventing it from coming to the House floor for a vote. Nehls at one point even told Politico that Congress should not impose \u201cmore burdensome regulations and all this other stuff.\u201d\n\nJustin Harclerode, a spokesman for Graves, said the chairman \u201cbelieves that the safety experts at the NTSB should be allowed to finish their investigation and report their findings to Congress before it takes up any legislation, including bills based on assumptions or factors that had absolutely nothing to do with the East Palestine accident.\u201d\n\nEmily Matthews, a spokeswoman for Nehls, said the GOP lawmaker would \u201cnot let emotion or media dictate the policy,\u201d adding in a statement: \u201cFreight rail is both the safest and most effective mode of surface transportation.\u201d\n\nOther recipients of the rail industry\u2019s campaign donations have explicitly tried to water down the legislation in ways that major freight operators support. The dynamic seemed especially evident in May, when the bill came before the transportation-focused Senate Commerce Committee for early consideration. While it cleared the panel, a key first step to reach the Senate floor, it did so over the objections of nearly every Republican \u2014 including Sen. John Thune (S.D.), who described it as a \u201cstalking horse for onerous regulatory mandates and union giveaways.\u201d\n\nThe second-most-powerful GOP lawmaker in the chamber, Thune formerly served as a registered lobbyist for railroads. He has received more than $67,000 from the industry and its top executives this election cycle, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets, a money-in-politics watchdog. The senator has previously intervened on the industry\u2019s behalf, even working to weaken regulations on brakes and other safety rules. The Intercept, a left-leaning publication, first reported on his past efforts.\n\nThune\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment. The Senate still has not scheduled a vote on the bill, even though Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) maintained in a statement that rail safety \u201cis a priority to get done.\u201d\n\nThe industry\u2019s efforts to engage Republicans stretch back decades, evident in work by leading rail operators to enlist a network of conservative advocacy groups to advance their views. Companies including Norfolk Southern and CSX, along with the Association of American Railroads (AAR), have previously donated to organizations that are influential among GOP lawmakers \u2014 including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which has forcefully opposed the Railway Safety Act.\n\nIn a July letter, CEI and other conservative groups attacked the bill for requiring increased train inspections and derailment protections, warning that the legislation would \u201cunduly empower unelected bureaucrats\u201d \u2014 meaning federal safety regulators. \u201cThis is why it garnered the support of just two Republicans on the Committee,\u201d wrote the groups, including Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks.\n\nCEI declined to comment on its donors. Travis Burk, a spokesman for the group, said it opposes the Railway Safety Act because it would \u201cfail to improve rail safety and impose pointless restrictions.\u201d\n\n\u2018I am not satisfied\u2019\n\nWith Congress unable to act, the Biden administration has ramped up its own regulatory efforts to improve rail safety.\n\nSince the derailment, the Transportation Department has completed about 7,500 inspections of track, signal and train control infrastructure, with a focus on trains carrying hazardous materials. In September, the Biden administration awarded about $1.4 billion in rail safety and infrastructure grants, and last month, it finalized new rules requiring trains carrying dangerous chemicals to have emergency breathing equipment onboard.\n\nEven that small change sparked intense pushback. In July, AAR, the industry\u2019s leading lobbying organization, criticized the Biden administration for the \u201cexorbitant proposed cost impacts\u201d on freight railroads that might have to provide special breathing tools. Even though Congress had tasked the government with issuing those rules, the freight railroads still argued the government did not have the authority to act.\n\n\u201cI am not satisfied with where things are,\u201d Buttigieg said of the industry\u2019s progress one year after the East Palestine derailment.\n\nThe Biden administration has also tried to require railroads to employ two engineers on every train. For years, rail operators have whittled down their crews to cut costs, prompting the Transportation Department to try to craft new staffing rules starting in 2022.\n\nWhile unions cheered the proposal, the rail industry mounted more than a year of vigorous opposition, arguing in legal filings that such a requirement would prove too expensive. At a federal hearing in December 2022, Michael Rush, AAR\u2019s senior vice president for safety and operations, told federal regulators that there is \u201cno evidence that two-person crews are safer than one-person crews.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s actual ample data on the safety of operating a train with one person in the locomotive cab,\u201d he said.\n\nThe argument stood in stark contrast to the widespread outcry among rail industry workers at Norfolk Southern, CSX, BNSF and Union Pacific, thousands of whom have written the Biden administration to express their alarm and lobby for new legislation.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of trains around the country carrying hazardous materials,\u201d said Greg Regan, the president of the Transportation Trades Department with the AFL-CIO, which represents 33 transportation-related unions. \u201cOur members have not seen any meaningful changes from the railroads.\u201d\n\nThe fierce resistance prompted Congress to try to require at least two crew members on freight trains as part of the Railway Safety Act. The bill\u2019s sponsors incorporated the provision partly out of a concern that any action by the Biden administration could be subject to a lawsuit or repeal.\n\nShaw, the leader of Norfolk Southern, told Congress that a two-person requirement wasn\u2019t necessary, since the train in East Palestine carried three people, one of whom was in training. In a tense exchange at a Senate hearing last March, he repeatedly refused to endorse the idea, at one point saying he was \u201cnot aware of any data that links crew size with safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get sick of industry executives talking about supporting the principles of regulation while they lobby against common sense regulations like this one,\u201d replied Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) at the time.\n\nOther freight rail executives similarly descended on Washington to press the issue. Joseph Hinrichs, the chief executive of CSX, specifically visited last spring to communicate his opposition to Brown\u2014 only to be rebuked by the bill\u2019s chief sponsor.\n\n\u201cI said to Mr. Henrichs, \u2018Did you fly up from Jacksonville?\u2019 He said yes,\u201d Brown later recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Did you stop by the cockpit? Were there one or two pilots?\u2019 He laughed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any normal human being who thinks there shouldn\u2019t be more than one person on these trains,\u201d Brown said.\n\nSheriee Bowman, a spokeswoman for CSX, said in a statement that Hinrichs also \u201casked the senator how many people are required to be in the cabs of trucks that operate on congested highways and on public roads that statistically have far more accidents than trains.\u201d She said there is \u201cno data that equates crew size to safer trains,\u201d even as she stressed that CSX \u201cis not pursuing one-person crews.\u201d"}

ArrowRight West Point\u2019s policy was challenged in September by Students for Fair Admissions, the same group that targeted affirmative action policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The group alleges that the admissions program at West Point \u2014 which takes race into account, among other factors, in the selection of a class of future Army officers \u2014 is unconstitutional and unneeded for a military service that relies on soldiers following orders regardless of the skin color of the superiors who issue them.\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down the Harvard and UNC programs in June in a landmark decision that severely limited the role of race in college admissions nationwide. But the majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., left open the question of race in admissions to the military service academies. In a footnote, the majority said no military academies were a party to the lawsuits, adding that lower courts had not addressed \u201cthe propriety of race-based admissions systems in that context,\u201d nor did the high court because of the \u201cpotentially distinct interests that military academies may present.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its brief unsigned order Friday, the justices denied the emergency request, saying the record before the court is \u201cunderdeveloped.\u201d\n\nThere were no noted dissents, but the court said its order \u201cshould not be construed as expressing any view on the merits of the constitutional question.\u201d\n\nThree other military academies also consider race in admissions, government officials say.

In this painting, completed in 1958, the man is shown from behind, facing out over a hilly landscape. A baguette and a wine glass hover in the foreground.\n\nOlivier Camu, Christie\u2019s deputy chairman for Impressionist and modern art, said the \u201chighly poetic, highly dreamy\u201d painting is among the handful of most important Magritte works in private hands. Last exhibited publicly in Brussels in 1998, it\u2019s being auctioned for the first time since 1980, and has a pre-sale estimate of between 30 million and 50 million pounds ($38 million and $64 million).\n\nThis year marks the centenary of Andre Breton\u2019s \u201cSurrealist Manifesto,\u201d which defined a revolutionary artistic movement characterized by unsettling juxtapositions and paradoxical statements \u2014 as in Magritte\u2019s most famous work, a painting of a pipe titled \u201cThis is not a pipe.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s become usual to think of the subconscious, psychology, psychoanalysis -- but they were the one who opened the doors,\u201d Camu said.\n\nCamu said Magritte, who died in 1967, has become the most \u201cin-demand\u201d of all the surrealists. Unlike the work of contemporaries such as Salvador Dali, there are few specific cultural or religious references to be found in his work.\n\n\u201cMagritte never explained anything,\u201d Camu said \u2014 even the titles of his paintings were suggested by friends.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sign of religion in Magritte ever, or particular history, or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are totally conceptual, clean, powerful, disturbing, wonderful, silent pictures. They are accessible to everybody.\u201d\n\nThat claim is backed up by soaring prices for Magritte\u2019s work in recent years, hitting a record 59.4 million pounds ($79.8 million at the time) for \u201cL\u2019empire des lumi\u00e8res\u201d (The Empire of Light) at a Sotheby\u2019s auction in 2022.\n\nThe work up for sale in March comes from the collection of the late Gilbert Kaplan \u2014 founder of the publication Institutional Investor \u2014 and his wife, Lena Kaplan.\n\nThe painting will be on display before the sale at Christie\u2019s in Los Angeles Feb 3, 5 and 6, in New York Feb 9-14, in Hong Kong Feb 21-23 and in London March 1-7."}

Heath said the cause of death was pancreatic cancer.\n\nFrom the late 1960s to early 1970s, no band was closer to the revolutionary spirit of the time than the MC5, which featured Kramer and Fred \u201cSonic\u201d Smith on guitars, Rob Tyner on vocals, Michael Davis on bass and Dennis \u201cMachine Gun\u201d Thompson on drums. Managed for a time by White Panther co-founder John Sinclair, they were known for their raw, uncompromising music, which they envisioned as the soundtrack for the uprising to come.\n\n\u201cBrother Wayne Kramer was the best man I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello wrote on Instagram Friday. \u201cHe possessed a one of a kind mixture of deep wisdom & profound compassion, beautiful empathy and tenacious conviction. His band the MC5 basically invented punk rock music.\u201d\n\nThe band had little commercial success and its core lineup did not last beyond the early 1970s, but its legacy endured, both for its sound and for its fusing of music to political action. Kramer, who had a long history of legal battles and substance abuse, would tell his story in the 2018 memoir \u201cThe Hard Stuff: Dope, Crime, the MC5, and My Life of Impossibilities.\u201d\n\nMorello is among the musicians appearing on a new MC5 album, \u201cHeavy Lifting,\u201d which comes out this spring and includes Kramer and Thompson from the original group. Slash, Vernon Reid and William DuVall of Alice in Chains also contributed.\n\n\u201cPushing music forward, carrying a message of self-efficacy and empowerment \u2014 and just to have fun,\u201d Kramer told Mojo magazine in December. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the MC5. Creativity is the solution for the challenges we face.\u201d\n\nThompson is now the band\u2019s only surviving member.\n\nKramer and Smith had known each other since their teens and played with various other musicians around Detroit before the core lineup was in place, in the mid-1960s. At Tyner\u2019s suggestions, they called themselves the MC5, short for Motor City Five, and emulated the Rolling Stones, the Who, and other hard rock bands of the era.\n\nBy 1968, they had built a substantial local following and were influenced by Marxism, the White Panthers, the Beats and other social-political movements. The MC5 was more radical politically than most of its peers, and otherwise louder and more daring. They were virtually the only band to perform during the infamous 1968 Democratic National Convention, in Chicago, where police were beating up anti-war protesters.\n\n\u201cKick Out the Jams\u201d was their most famous song, and opened with an unprintable call to arms: \u201cKick out the jams motherf--\u2014\u2014-!\u201d A live album of the same name reached the top 40 in 1969, their highest-charting release. They also released the studio albums \u201cBack in the USA\u201d and \u201cHigh Time\u201d before breaking up at the end of 1972.\n\nKramer would lead various incarnations of the MC5 over the following decades, and perform with Was (Not Was) among other groups. But for a time he sank into the life of what he called \u201ca small-time Detroit criminal.\u201d He was arrested on drug charges in 1975 and sentenced to four years in prison. Jail Guitar Doors, which provides inmates with musical instruments, is named for a Clash song that refers to his struggles: \u201cLet me tell you \u2019bout Wayne and his deals of cocaine.\u201d\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Margaret Saadi, and son, Francis."}

A diverse range of options across various asset classes like stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities and money markets, in combination with different strategies such as actively managed funds and smart beta, can attract a wide range of investors.\n\nAnother critical factor is cost, particularly the expense ratio. A lower expense ratio means less drag on performance, which is crucial in a competitive environment where every basis point can impact returns. Fund managers who focus on keeping costs low can provide a more attractive option for investors mindful of their expenses.\n\n\n\nAccessibility is also key. While accumulating assets under management is important for a fund, making sure that new investors aren't deterred by high minimum investment requirements and transaction fees is equally important. Funds that are accessible to a broad audience, regardless of their investment size, tend to be more appealing.\n\nCharles Schwab Corp.'s (ticker: SCHW) mutual fund lineup excels in these areas, making it a prime choice for investors at all levels. The variety and depth of its funds, combined with competitive costs and accessibility, are complemented by a robust brokerage platform, offering a comprehensive solution for those looking to build a diversified portfolio.\n\n\"What makes Charles Schwab stand out is their commitment to providing a diverse range of investment options to suit the needs of all types of investors,\" says Andrew Mark Latham, director of content at SuperMoney.com.\n\nJim Penna, senior manager of retirement services at VectorVest, agrees with Latham, noting: \"A factor that makes Schwab a top fund provider for me is the user-friendly platform they provide for researching, buying and managing funds.\"\n\nHere are seven of the best Charles Schwab mutual funds in 2024:\n\n\n\nFund Expense ratio Schwab Total Stock Market Index Fund (SWTSX) 0.03% Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX) 0.02% Schwab International Index Fund (SWISX) 0.06% Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index Fund (SFENX) 0.39% Schwab Global Real Estate Fund (SWASX) 0.75% Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Fund (SWAGX) 0.04% Schwab Short-Term Bond Index Fund (SWSBX) 0.06%\n\nSchwab Total Stock Market Index Fund (SWTSX)\n\n\"One Schwab fund that is worth considering is SWTSX, which offers broad exposure to the entire U.S. equity market and has a low expense ratio of 0.03%,\" Latham says. By tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index, SWTSX currently holds around 3,400 large-, mid- and small-cap domestic equities weighted by market capitalization, meaning that the larger a company is, the higher weighting it has.\n\nBecause its benchmark index is so broad, SWTSX manages to keep annual portfolio turnover very low at just 1.9%. This is a benefit for investors, as it reduces the number of taxable events incurred by the fund when it needs to buy and sell securities. Complementing the 0.03% expense ratio is a lack of minimum required investment amounts and a long track record dating back to June 1999.\n\nSchwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX)\n\n\"As in any fund you may consider, there are certain characteristics to always look for, starting with expense ratios, and the Schwab index funds have a favorable expense for passive funds,\" Penna says. \"For example, SWPPX has an expense ratio of just 0.02%.\" This puts the fund in the top ranks when it comes to affordability, working out to around $2 in annual fees for a $10,000 investment.\n\nCompared to SWTSX, SWPPX is slightly less diversified. This fund tracks the S&P 500, which encompasses 500 large- and mid-cap stocks selected by a committee subject to minimum profitability requirements. It omits many of the mid- and small-cap stocks held by SWTSX. Still, because SWPPX is weighted by market cap, its top holdings resemble those of SWTSX.\n\nSchwab International Index Fund (SWISX)\n\nInvesting in Schwab's mutual funds doesn't mean sticking to the U.S. markets only. The firm also provides a wide range of funds designed to track international markets. For example, SWISX holds stocks from the EAFE region, which stands for Europe, Australasia and the Far East. These are known as developed markets, and include countries like the U.K., Japan, Australia, Germany, France and more.\n\nAs a passively managed fund, SWISX tracks the MSCI EAFE index. Over the past 15 years, the fund has returned an annualized 7.8%. While this is lower than the performance of domestic equity funds, investors should think long term and remember that U.S. market outperformance is not guaranteed to persist. SWISX charges a 0.06% expense ratio, which is low for international equities.\n\nSchwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index Fund (SFENX)\n\nTo complete a global stock portfolio, investors can complement SWTSX and SWISX with SFENX. This mutual fund tracks emerging market equities via the MSCI EM Index, which comprises stocks hailing from countries undergoing rapid growth, commerce and industrialization. These include countries like Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, to name a few.\n\nHistorically, SFENX has not posted the best performance, returning just 3.2% over the past 10 years. This came during a period of U.S. outperformance that saw emerging markets lag. However, a small allocation to emerging markets via SFENX may be prudent for investors prioritizing global diversification. That being said, this fund is significantly pricier, at a 0.39% expense ratio.\n\n\n\nSchwab Global Real Estate Fund (SWASX)\n\nInvestors looking for exposure to real estate prices without buying a rental property or investing in individual real estate investment trusts, or REITs, can do so via SWASX. This fund actively selects a portfolio of about 120 REITs from around the world, with a 61% concentration in North American markets. However, it is costly, with a 0.75% expense ratio and 87% turnover.\n\nCurrently, the top holdings in SWASX's portfolio are U.S.-listed REITs like Prologis Inc. (PLD), Equinix Inc. (EQIX), Public Storage (PSA) and Equity Residential Properties Trust (EQR). Over the past 15 years, the fund has returned an annualized 7.9%. Given the nature of its holdings, SWASX also has above-average income potential, currently paying out a 3.8% 30-day SEC yield.\n\nSchwab U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Fund (SWAGX)\n\nTo lower volatility, investors often resort to high-quality bonds. Typically, this includes U.S.-government-issued Treasurys, mortgage-backed securities and investment-grade corporate bonds of various maturities. To access a complete package of these bonds within a single fund, investors can buy SWAGX, which tracks the benchmark Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.\n\nSWAGX's portfolio currently averages out to a six-year duration. All else being equal, a 100-basis-point increase in interest rates will cause the fund to lose around 6% in value. Conversely, a 100-basis-point decrease in rates will cause the fund to appreciate around the same amount. Currently, investors can expect a 4.2% 30-day SEC yield and a low 0.04% expense ratio.\n\nSchwab Short-Term Bond Index Fund (SWSBX)\n\n\"What I like in the Schwab fund lineup today is SWSBX,\" says Michael Wagner, co-founder and chief operating officer at Omnia Family Wealth. \"We want to have a healthy allocation to short-term bonds and can access that using SWSBX.\" Compared to SWAGX, this fund has much lower interest rate sensitivity, with a duration of 2.6 years. It also comes in at a fairly low expense ratio of 0.06%."}

Zelenskiy thinks that\u2019s not necessary now,\" the source said.\n\nZaluzhnyi on Thursday published a column on the CNN website in which he wrote that the government had failed to mobilize enough troops.\n\nKnown as \"the Iron General,\" Zaluzhnyi is extremely popular. His removal could hurt morale among Ukrainian troops battling to hold positions along more than 620 miles (1,000 km) of frontlines against a vast Russian force armed with large munitions stockpiles.\n\nUkrainian forces are experiencing shortages of critical ammunition. Supplies from the United States, the country's largest arms provider, have run down, and a dispute between the White House and some Republican lawmakers has stalled approval of a new aid package.\n\nA flurry of Western and Ukrainian media reports said that Zaluzhnyi rejected Zelenskiy's request that he step aside this week.\n\nThe plan to replace Zaluzhnyi despite his popularity and ability as an inspiring commander may signal Kyiv's desire for a fresh approach to the conflict.\n\n(Writing by Jonathan Landay; Editing by Leslie Adler and Cynthia Osterman)"}

Hamer never recovered and he died a few months later of his injuries.\n\nVittorio Emanuele was eventually acquitted of the killing in a French court in 1991 and given a suspended sentence for illegal possession of a rifle.\n\nHamer's family had long contested the verdict and the case gained renewed attention when it formed the centrepiece of a recent Netflix documentary \"The King Who Never Was\".\n\nThe prince faced further legal troubles when he was arrested in 2006 on the orders of a magistrate in the southern Italian town of Potenza on charges of racketeering and involvement in prostitution.

His wedding was held in Tehran.\n\nAlthough living in exile, Vittorio Emanuele was named in 1981 as one of more than 900 members of the outlawed secret masonic lodge Propaganda 2 (P2), a group at the heart of many of Italy's scandals of the late 20th century.\n\nHis grandfather, King Victor Emanuel III, abdicated in favour of his son Umberto just before the 1946 referendum in a final, futile attempt to save the monarchy.\n\nBut Vittorio Emanuele's parents, Umberto II and Maria Jose, ruled over Italy for just over a month before the family headed into its long exile.\n\nVittorio Emanuele is survived by his wife and his son, Emanuele Filiberto, who said in 2023 that he would renounce his claim to the Italian throne in favour of his daughter, Vittoria, when he felt she was ready for the challenge.\n\n(Writing by Keith Weir; Editing by Toby Chopra)"}

Gore, a decision delivered a quarter-century ago that effectively delivered the 2000 election to Republican George W. Bush. It comes to a court that has been buffeted by criticism over ethics, which led the justices to adopt their first code of conduct in November, and at a time when public approval of the court is diminished, at near-record lows in surveys.\n\nThe dispute stems from the push by Republican and independent voters in Colorado to kick Trump off the state\u2019s Republican primary ballot because of his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nColorado\u2019s highest court determined that Trump incited the riot in the nation's capital and is ineligible to be president again as a result and should not be on the ballot for the state's primary on March 5.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nA victory for the Colorado voters would amount to a declaration from the justices, who include three appointed by Trump when he was president, that he did engage in insurrection and is barred by the 14th Amendment from holding office again. That would allow states to keep him off the ballot and imperil his campaign.\n\nA definitive ruling for Trump would largely end efforts in Colorado, Maine and elsewhere to prevent his name from appearing on the ballot.\n\nThe justices could opt for a less conclusive outcome, but with the knowledge that the issue could return to them, perhaps after the general election in November and in the midst of a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n\nThe court has signaled it will try to act quickly, dramatically shortening the period in which it receives written briefing and holds arguments in the courtroom.\n\nTrump is separately appealing to state court a ruling by Maine\u2019s Democratic secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, that he was ineligible to appear on that state\u2019s ballot over his role in the Capitol attack. Both the Colorado Supreme Court and the Maine secretary of state\u2019s rulings are on hold until the appeals play out.\n\nThe former president is not expected to attend the Supreme Court session this coming week, though he has shown up for court proceedings in the civil lawsuits and criminal charges he is fighting.\n\nWhatever the justices decide, they are likely to see more of Trump, who is facing criminal charges related to Jan. 6 and other issues. Other election-related litigation also is possible.\n\nIn 2000, in Bush v. Gore, the court and the parties were divided over whether the justices should intervene at all.\n\nThe conservative-driven 5-4 decision has been heavily criticized ever since, especially given that the court cautioned against using the case as precedent when the unsigned majority opinion declared that \u201cour consideration is limited to the present circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn the current case, both parties want the matter settled, and quickly.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign declined to make anyone available for this story, but his lawyers urged the justices not to delay.\n\n\u201cThe Court should put a swift and decisive end to these ballot-disqualification efforts, which threaten to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans and which promise to unleash chaos and bedlam if other state courts and state officials follow Colorado\u2019s lead and exclude the likely Republican presidential nominee from their ballots,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote.\n\nDonald Sherman, the top lawyer at the group behind the ballot challenge, said voters and election officials need to have an answer quickly.\n\n\u201cAnd I think, obviously, voters have a not small interest in knowing whether the Supreme Court thinks, as every fact-finder that has reached this question, that Jan. 6 was an insurrection and that Donald Trump is an insurrectionist,\u201d Sherman said in an interview with The Associated Press. He is executive vice president and chief legal counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas is the only sitting member of the court who was on the bench for Bush v. Gore. He was part of that majority.\n\nBut three other justices joined the legal fight on Bush\u2019s side: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Bush eventually put Roberts on a federal appeals court and then appointed him chief justice. Bush hired Kavanaugh to important White House jobs before making him an appellate judge, too.\n\nKavanaugh and Barrett were elevated to the Supreme Court by Trump, who also appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nThomas has ignored calls by some Democratic lawmakers and ethics professors to step aside from the current case. They note that his wife, Ginni Thomas, supported Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Ginni Thomas repeatedly texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in the weeks after that election, once referring to it as a \u201cheist,\" and she attended the rally that preceded the storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters. Nearly two years later, she told the congressional committee investigating the attack that she regretted sending the texts.\n\nTrump lost 60 different court challenges to his false claims that there was massive voter fraud that would have changed the results of that election.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled repeatedly ruled against Trump and his allies in 2020 election-related lawsuits, as well as his efforts to keep documents related to Jan. 6 and his tax returns from being turned over to congressional committees.\n\nThe issue of whether Trump can be on the ballot is just one among several matters related to the former president or Jan. 6 that have reached the high court. The justices declined a request from special counsel Jack Smith to rule swiftly on Trump\u2019s claims that he is immune from prosecution, though the issue could be back before the court soon depending on the ruling of a Washington-based appeals court.\n\nIn April, the court will hear an appeal that could upend hundreds of charges stemming from the Capitol riot, including against Trump."}

Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said that 23 people were killed in the Syria strikes, all rank-and-file fighters.\n\nIraqi government spokesperson Bassim al-Awadi said in a statement Saturday that the strikes in Iraq near the Syrian border killed 16, including civilians, and there was \u201csignificant damage\u201d to homes and private properties.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nIraq\u2019s foreign ministry announced Saturday it would summon the U.S. embassy\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires \u2014 the ambassador being outside of the country \u2014 to deliver a formal protest over U.S. strikes on \u201cIraqi military and civilian sites.\u201d\n\nThe air assault was the opening salvo of U.S. retaliation for a drone strike that killed three U.S. troops in Jordan last weekend. The U.S. has blamed that on the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of Iranian-backed militias.\n\nIran, meanwhile, has attempted to distance itself from the attack, saying that the militias act independently of its direction.\n\nIraqi spokesperson al-Awadi condemned the strikes as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty, particularly since some of them targeted facilities of the Population Mobilization Forces. The PMF, a coalition of Iranian-backed militias, was officially brought under the umbrella of the Iraqi armed forces after it joined the fight against the Islamic State in 2014, but in practice it continues to operate largely outside of state control.\n\nThe Popular Mobilization Forces said in a statement Saturday that one of the sites targeted was an official security headquarters of the group. In addition to 16 killed, it said 36 had been wounded, \u201cwhile the search is still ongoing for the bodies of a number of the missing.\u201d\n\nThe Iraqi government has been in a delicate position since a group of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias calling itself Islamic Resistance in Iraq \u2014 many of whose members are also part of the PMF \u2014 began launching attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria on Oct. 18. The group described the strikes as retaliation for Washington's support for Israel in the war in Gaza.\n\nIraqi officials have attempted behind the scenes to rein the militias in, while also condemning U.S. retaliatory strikes as a violation of the country's sovereignty and calling for an exit of the 2,500 U.S. troops in the country as part of an international coalition to fight IS. Last month, Iraqi and U.S. military officials launched formal talks to wind down the coalition's presence, a process that will likely take years.\n\nOne of the main Iran-backed militias, Kataib Hezbollah, said it was suspending attacks on American troops following Sunday's strike that killed the U.S. troops in Jordan, to avoid \u201cembarrassing\u201d the Iraqi government.\n\n___\n\nAbby Sewell and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report."}

It's not as contradictory as it might seem. Recent job cuts have been concentrated mainly in just a few sectors: technology, finance and media.\n\nRelative to the U.S. labor force of 160 million people, layoffs so far have been dwarfed by consistently vigorous hiring \u2014 a monthly average of 248,000 jobs added over the past six months. The unemployment rate is still just 3.7%, barely above a 50-year low.\n\nIt turns out that many of the companies that are now shedding jobs had over-hired during the pandemic, when they thought the trends that emerged then \u2014 especially a surge in online shopping \u2014 would continue apace. As the economy has normalized, many of these companies have discovered that they no longer need so many employees and have responded with layoffs.\n\nIn January, American businesses and other employers added a blistering 353,000 jobs \u2014 the biggest monthly haul in a year. The government also revised up its estimate of job gains in November and December by a combined 126,000. The data provided compelling evidence that most companies, large and small, are confident enough in the economy to keep hiring.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nSeveral of the companies that have announced layoffs are among the most well-known household names: Google, Amazon, eBay, UPS, Spotify and Facebook's parent Meta. Not that they've been the only ones. Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a leading outplacement firm, reported this week that businesses announced 82,000 layoffs in January, the second-most for any January since 2009.\n\nHere are some reasons why these seemingly disparate trends are coinciding:\n\nJOB GAINS AND JOB CUTS ARE HAPPENING IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES\n\nIn most industries, businesses have kept adding workers over the past three months. Manufacturers, for example, added 56,000 in November, December and January combined. Restaurants, hotels and entertainment companies gained nearly 60,000 over that time. Health care providers \u2014 hospitals, doctors' offices, and dentists \u2014 added a whopping 300,000.\n\nThey're not all low-paying jobs, either: A sector that the government calls professional and business services, a sprawling category that includes accountants, engineers, lawyers and their support staff \u2014 has 120,000 more jobs than it did in October. Federal, state and local governments, which regained their pre-pandemic levels of employment in September, also added nearly 120,000 jobs over that period.\n\nThe job cuts, by contrast, have been more concentrated. The Labor Department doesn't track technology jobs specifically, but Friday's jobs report pointed to signs of the industry's struggles: The unemployment rate for workers in what the government calls the \u201cinformation\u201d sector, which includes media and tech workers, jumped to 5.5% in January from 3.9% a year ago. That's nearly 2 percentage points above the national jobless rate.\n\nLAYOFFS DON'T MEAN THE ECONOMY IS WEAK\n\nMore confusing is why companies would cut workers if the economy is growing and consumers keep spending. Last week, the government estimated that the economy expanded at a healthy 3.3% annual pace in the October-December quarter after robust growth of 4.9% the previous quarter.\n\nCompanies tend to shed jobs for all sorts of reasons, sometimes to reflect changes in their business strategy or to maintain or boost their profit margins. Many high-tech companies that went on hiring binges in 2022, as the economy accelerated out of the pandemic recession, miscalculated the longer-term demand for their products and services.\n\nIn its survey of job cuts, Challenger, Gray & Christmas said the leading reason companies cited last month for laying off workers was \u201crestructuring.\u201d A year earlier, it was \u201ceconomic conditions,\u201d economists at Renaissance Macro noted, meaning that companies had previously worried more about the state of the economy.\n\nTodd McKinnon, CEO of the software company Okta, said in a message announcing that the company would cut about 400 jobs that it entered 2023 \u201cwith a growth plan based on the demand we experienced in the prior year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis led us to over-hire for the macroeconomic reality we\u2019re in today,\" he wrote.\n\nTHE LAYOFFS ARE SPREAD OVER TIME\n\nHigh-profile job cuts typically involve many layoffs that aren't implemented immediately. For example, UPS, the delivery and logistics provider, announced earlier this week that it would cut 12,000 jobs this year. But it said those reductions will take place over months. So they weren't included in the January jobs data that was released Friday because the layoffs hadn't yet taken place.\n\nIT'S A REALLY BIG ECONOMY\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that the government's jobs figures will worsen over time as reductions by UPS and others are implemented. Jobs cuts are deeply distressing and disruptive for people who suffer them. But layoffs even of UPS' magnitude don't really move the needle in the vast U.S. economy. Each month, roughly 5 million people leave their jobs or are laid off, government data shows, while more than 5 million are hired.\n\nA raft of other data confirm that overall, the job market is fundamentally healthy. The number of people seeking unemployment benefits, long seen as a measure of layoffs, remains at a very low level. And non-government data, including hiring tracked by the payroll provider ADP, shows that private-sector companies keep adding workers."}

His representatives say he will launch appeals in all three cases.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if his various sentences would run concurrently.\n\nKhan is in prison in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, while his wife will serve her sentence at their hilltop mansion in nearby Islamabad. He already faces a 10-year disqualification from holding public office.\n\n\"After hours of rushed hearings at court, no cross examination of witnesses, and no due process - a mockery of the law,\" Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), said in a statement.\n\n\"With the way these trials are being conducted, there will be a huge question mark on the February 8th elections. This is a test case for Pakistan's higher judiciary.\"\n\nThe couple were each fined 500,000 rupees ($1,800), ARY News reported.\n\nBushra was accused of not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called \"Iddat\", after divorcing her previous husband and marrying Khan.\n\nThe Khans signed their marriage contract, or \"Nikkah\", in January 2018 in a secret ceremony seven months before the former cricket superstar became prime minister for the first time.\n\nThere was controversy over whether they had wed before the period was complete. After initial denials of the marriage, PTI confirmed it weeks later.\n\nThe Khans both denied wrongdoing.\n\n\"Can say I\u2019m a witness in the Nikkah and it\u2019s a categorically yet another fake case,\" Khan's media advisor Zulfi Bukhari told Reuters. \"From witnesses to the evidence to the procedure.\"\n\nCRIMINAL COMPLAINT\n\nBushra's ex-husband, Khawar Maneka, to whom she was married for about 30 years, brought a criminal complaint against the Khans, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nKhan has often called Bushra his spiritual leader. She is known for her devotion to Sufism, a mystical form of Islam.\n\nBorn Bushra Riaz Watto, she changed her name to Khan after her marriage. Her husband and followers commonly refer to her as Bushra Bibi or Bushra Begum, titles that denote respect in Urdu.\n\nIt was not clear when or how Khan met Bushra, but former aide Aun Chaudhry said Khan was impressed with her spirituality.\n\nKhan, who had acquired a playboy image in the 1990s as his cricket career took off, has said he is keenly interested in Sufism.\n\nKhan's two previous marriages - to Jemima Goldsmith, daughter of tycoon James Goldsmith, and television journalist Reham Nayyar Khan - ended in divorce.\n\nKhan has been fighting dozens of cases since he was ousted from power in a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in 2022. He says his removal was backed by the powerful military with whom he fell out while in office.\n\nHe and his party say they have been subjected to a military-backed crackdown, including arrests of hundreds of supporters, party members and key aides.\n\nThe military, which has for decades held sway over Pakistan's politics, denies the claims.\n\nNAB, the anti-graft agency that put Khan on trial, has at various times investigated, tried and jailed all prime ministers to have served since 2008, including Nawaz Sharif, whose party is considered the frontrunner in next week's election.\n\n(Reporting by Ariba Shahid and Gibran Peshimam; Editing by William Mallard and Giles Elgood)"}

It was all dust and dirt. I was touching my surroundings, I was looking for my mobile to use the flashlight to look for my children, where are they? I found them under the rubble,\" said Ahmed Bassam Al-Jamal, whose son was killed.\n\n\"I cried for help and people came. I got out Yamen, the first one, he was the only one I can see, the rest were still under the rubble. They pulled out Yamen, Eileen and Sila and they pulled out their mother (all alive). We could not find Bassam, we were looking for him, but he was buried, we could not save them, I swear we couldn't,\" Jamal said, as he bade farewell to his dead son at the hospital.\n\nIn the central Gaza Strip city of Deir Al-Balah, the second major concentration of displaced people, medics said four people were killed in an air strike on a house earlier on Saturday.\n\nIn nearby Khan Younis, residents said the army blew up a residential district near the city centre.\n\nThe Gaza health ministry said heavy Israeli bombardment around the city's two main hospitals continued to undermine healthcare systems and endanger the lives of staff, patients, and displaced people who have taken shelter there.\n\nOn Friday, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said four people were killed by Israeli gunfire directed against the Al-Amal Hospital.\n\nIn Gaza City, residents and militants said fighting continued against Israeli forces. Health officials said two people were killed by sniper fire. Israeli forces carried out arrests in the southern suburb of Tel Al-Hawa.\n\nIsrael launched a war on Hamas, the militant group which rules the Gaza Strip, after an October onslaught on southern Israel by Hamas militants who killed 1,200 people and took 253 people hostage into Gaza, more than 100 of whom are still captive, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsraeli officials say they aim to eliminate Hamas, which has vowed to repeat its October attacks, and repatriate the hostages, many of whom are women and children.\n\nGaza health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians in their tallies, say more than 27,000 Palestinians have been confirmed killed since the start of the war, 107 of them in the past 24 hours, with thousands more feared lost amid the ruins.\n\nThe Israeli military said its forces killed dozens of Palestinian gunmen in northern Gaza.\n\n\"During targeted raids in the northern and central Gaza Strip over the last day, IDF troops killed dozens of terrorists and destroyed numerous anti-tank missile launchers,\" the Israel Defense Forces said.\n\nHamas, Islamic Jihad, and other smaller militant groups said in a separate statement their fighters engaged in fierce battles with the army in the north and the south of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"The more the occupation forces remain on the ground, the more we will get to them,\" one Palestinian militant official said.\n\n\"A martyr falls, another rises and takes the rifle, and we are ready to fight for many more months,\" he told Reuters.\n\nAsked about Israel saying it killed 10,000 militants, he said, \"This is for public consumption in the occupation entity. It is fiction.\"\n\nCEASEFIRE PROPOSAL\n\nMediators are awaiting a response from Hamas to a proposal for the war's first extended ceasefire, drafted last week with Israeli and U.S. spy chiefs and communicated by Egypt and Qatar. It was unclear when Hamas leaders would visit Cairo to respond.\n\nA brief November truce lasted just one week, when militants freed 110 women, children and foreign hostages in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.\n\nOn Friday, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, who is leading negotiations with Qatar and Egypt, said he spoke to the chief of the Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, and the leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, to discuss the ceasefire proposal.\n\nA Hamas statement said the discussions stressed that: \"Any negotiations should lead to a complete end to the aggression, the withdrawal of the occupation army outside the Gaza Strip, the lifting of the siege,\" as well as reconstruction, provision for Gaza's basic needs and a full exchange of captives.\n\nHowever, Israel says Hamas must be eradicated before it pulls its troops out or frees detainees, and its main ally, the United States, has not publicly set any goals that call that into question.\n\n(Reporting and writing by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Doha; additional reporting by Emily Rose in Jerusalem, Ibraheem Abu Mustafa in Gaza; Editing by Giles Elgood)"}

He campaigned for the presidency on the same promise and made an official request to India soon after his election.\n\nOn Friday contradictory statements emerged from the two countries in relation to the withdrawal of Indian troops.\n\nThe Maldives foreign ministry said in a statement that officials from both countries met in New Delhi and agreed that India would begin withdrawing troops from the Maldives on March 10 and complete the process by withdrawing from all three aviation platforms by May 10.\n\nBut an Indian foreign ministry statement did not mention a withdrawal, saying instead that both sides agreed on a set of solutions \u201cto enable continued operation of Indian aviation platforms that provide humanitarian and medevac services to the people of Maldives.\u201d\n\nIt is believed there are at least 75 Indian military personnel in the Maldives and their known activities include transporting patients from remote islands and rescuing people at sea.\n\nThe dispute between the two countries worsened last month when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted pictures on social media of himself strolling and snorkelling on the beaches of Lakshadweep, an Indian archipelago that looks nearly identical to the Maldives islands.\n\nThe Indian government believes that its chain of islands has untapped potential for tourism, and some in the Maldives thought that Modi's posts were a way of luring tourists away from the famous white sand beaches and luxury island resorts of the Maldives.\n\nThree Maldivian deputy ministers posted derogatory posts against Modi which inflamed many Indians, leading to a social media campaign to boycott Maldives. The largest number of tourists visiting the Maldives come from India, making up 11% of the total last year.\n\nThe posts were taken down, the deputy ministers were suspended and the Maldives government stressed that the views expressed did not reflect government policy.\n\nMuizzu's China visit also coincided with the dispute, and he came back announcing plans to rid his nation of dependence on India for health and education and import of staples. He also cautioned that the Maldives' smaller size did not give any country the license to bully it, an apparent indirect reference to India."}

With the Federal Reserve possibly starting interest rate cuts in 2024, investors are bidding up equities across the board. Several major stock indexes have reached new record highs and excitement is in the air.\n\nThese sorts of cheerful conditions can cause investors to overpay for stocks. Thankfully, there are still some great bargains out there heading into February 2024. All five of these names dropped 10% or more over the past month, making them relative bargains in an otherwise frothy market. Here are five of the best stocks to buy now at fire sale prices:\n\n\n\n3M Co. (ticker: MMM)\n\nRockwell Automation Inc. (ROK)\n\nYum China Holdings Inc. (YUMC)\n\nUnity Software Inc. (U)\n\nIntel Corp. (INTC)\n\n3M Co. (MMM)\n\n3M is a massive industrial conglomerate. Its products run the gamut from auto body repair to adhesives, power distribution, industrial abrasives, dental equipment and countless other categories. 3M has long relied on its research and development and constant product innovation to drive organic growth.\n\nIn recent years, however, 3M has gotten tripped up. Between a series of product liability lawsuits and stagnation in several parts of the core business, it has been a decade to forget for 3M investors. However, the company is now engaged in a credible turnaround plan that should unlock considerable shareholder value going forward. Shares go for around 10 times forward earnings and offer a greater than 6% dividend yield today. The company sold off following its most recent earnings report, and that gives investors an opportunity. While 2024 may be a soft year for 3M given the current economic headwinds, the future should be bright as the company's turnaround gains momentum.\n\nRockwell Automation Inc. (ROK)\n\nRockwell Automation is an industrial company focused on helping firms bolster their automation capabilities. It runs across three categories: intelligent devices, software and control, and lifecycle services. Most competitors are strong in one or two of these categories. Where Rockwell stands out is that it offers the most complete automation ecosystem that can incorporate all three of these functions into an integrated package.\n\nRockwell shares recently sold off sharply on a disappointing earnings report. The firm serves clients in the automotive and chemicals industries, which are currently in a weak part of their cycles. The Federal Reserve's interest rate increases have curtailed demand in areas of the economy such as consumer discretionary, leading to cutbacks in corporate capital expenditure programs. However, automation remains a strong long-term theme, and that should be doubly true given the surge in labor costs over the past few years. Rockwell Automation often sells at a fairly high price-to-earnings ratio, but after the recent sell-off, shares now go for a reasonable 20 times forward earnings.\n\nYum China Holdings Inc. (YUMC)\n\nYum China is the Chinese division of multinational fast food company Yum Brands Inc. (YUM). The Chinese subsidiary operates KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, along with some other brands that are local to the Chinese market. Yum China also runs an e-commerce platform that sells prepared food in addition to home and kitchen accessories. The company is a massive operation within China, as it currently has about 400,000 employees. The KFC brand, in particular, has had resounding success within the Chinese market.\n\nHowever, the Chinese economy has stagnated since the onset of COVID-19. Between a softening export market, weak consumer sentiment and a struggling real estate sector, China is not awash with disposable income right now. All sorts of multinational companies have reported slowing sales out of the region over the past year, and, unsurprisingly, investors have dumped restaurant stocks as well. To that point, YUMC stock is down more than 40% over the past year. That leads to a solid entry point with shares now at 17 times forward earnings for this traditionally fast-growing consumer company.\n\nUnity Software Inc. (U)\n\nUnity Software runs a leading graphics engine primarily used for powering video games. The company has approximately 70% market share for powering mobile games, and it has a significant, though smaller, position in other platforms including PC, console, and virtual and augmented reality.\n\nUnity ran into problems from overexpansion. The gaming industry boomed during the pandemic when people were stuck at home and looking for new entertainment options. As the economy reopened, gaming growth slowed. 2023 was a record year for layoffs across the gaming industry, and Unity slashed its employee base as part of this industry rightsizing. Between the layoffs and some questions around Unity's revenue model, U stock has suffered. But the firm's cost-cutting should help it reach robust profitability in 2024. Meanwhile, Unity is helping build apps for Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) new Vision Pro augmented reality system. If spatial computing takes off with Apple's help, that should be a huge growth lever for Unity going forward.\n\nIntel Corp. (INTC)\n\nIntel is one of the world's leading semiconductor companies. The chip giant spends about $16 billion annually in research and development, and this massive investment has yielded Intel numerous technological breakthroughs and market-leading chip designs. In recent years, however, Intel has lost ground to rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA).\n\nIntel spun off its automotive technology division, Mobileye Global Inc. (MBLY), in 2022, but it retains a majority stake in that firm. Mobileye stock recently plunged following weak earnings as the auto market continues to lose steam. That, combined with weakness in Intel's core markets, has led to a recent correction in the share price."}

On its walls are photographs of how it used to be in 1904, packed with traders and buzzing, in an age when Wellingborough thrived and sold shoes and boots to the world.\n\nWhen he voted Conservative in 2019 \u2013 to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d \u2013 Holden had hoped things would get better, that the town\u2019s good times would return. \u201cBut I see very little that has changed,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere are all the new hospitals? I don\u2019t see them. Bills are up, and prices are up. And the boats are still a real problem.\n\n\u201cI have people coming here at the start of the week buying a cup of tea and they say \u2018I can\u2019t pay you until Friday\u2019. They are that short of money. It is not what I had imagined.\u201d\n\nAsked how he might vote in thenext week\u2019s byelection on 15 February, caused by the suspension of Tory MP Peter Bone over claims he bullied a former staff member a decade ago and exposed his genitals, he\u2019s at a loss. \u201cI am struggling to come up with an idea of who it will be,\u201d he says.\n\nThat is until the candidate for Reform UK, the new incarnation of the Brexit party, Ben Habib, a businessman and former MEP, swings by to deliver a chat about sending boats full of asylum seekers back to France, making sure Brexit is done properly, lowering taxes and cutting energy bills.\n\n\u201cI am not saying I am convinced, but it is something to think about,\u201d says Holden as he examines Habib\u2019s campaign leaflets.\n\nLabour, which held Wellingborough (a constituency that takes in Rushden and surrounding towns and villages) from 1997 to 2005, is now odds-on to overturn the majority of more than 18,000 won by Bone in 2019, in what would be one of the more predictable byelection \u201cshocks\u201d of recent years, such is the extent of the Tory party\u2019s recent descent.\n\nThe circumstances of Bone\u2019s departure and subsequent selection of his partner Helen Harrison as the Tory candidate to replace him, have left local people angry and disillusioned. \u201cIt leaves a really bad impression and looks bad for our town. A lot of people will not vote Tory again,\u201d says David Smart, an 81-year-old pensioner who says he will choose Labour because \u201cthey can\u2019t be worse than this lot\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen An apparently abandoned car sets the mood outside the Tory office in Wellingborough. Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer\n\nBut while a Labour win would spell even more trouble for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, so too would the prospect of a substantial advance for Reform UK.\n\nOn the streets of Wellinborough most people have heard of Reform and many say they are toying with voting for it. Its HQ on Sheep Street is the most visible of any party. \u201cIn previous byelections I have helped with, most people did not really know who we were,\u201d says Habib.\n\n\u201cThis time it is different. The recognition factor is about a hundred times higher.\u201d\n\nIt is possible, he says, that this new party, which is now hitting 10% in some national polls, could run the Tories close and even push them into third place.\n\nIf that were to happen it would probably trigger greater Tory panic than another Labour win, showing the extent to which Reform UK could split the rightwing vote at the next general election, particularly if Nigel Farage comes fully on board.\n\n\u201cI am getting a lot of thumbs up, a lot of pats on the back, I didn\u2019t see any of that in the other byelections,\u201d says Habib, who is also the party\u2019s co-deputy leader.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge is that we have not got the armies of people that the other two big parties have got, we have not got the information on voting in different households that the others have got, but I think the way sands are shifting, it is game on. Anything could happen. People who are angry come out to vote. People who are angry vote for change. They are not going to come out and vote Conservative!\u201d\n\nThe Tories have clearly all but given up in this election. Tory MPs are refusing to campaign in Wellinborough for fear of being ridiculed and insulted, and because they think it would be a complete waste of their time. The party headquarters previously used by Bone was locked on Friday, showing no sign of life.\n\nIn the window were posters of Harrison and her pledges, including those to \u201cstop the boats\u201d, \u201cimprove our NHS\u201d and \u201cfix our roads\u201d.\n\nParked directly outside was an abandoned car with a flat tyre that has been there so long that grass is growing on the bonnet and out of the boot. On the windscreen was a red DVLA notice, dated Friday, warning the owner of a potential \u00a31,000 fine for unpaid tax.\n\nView image in fullscreen Liz Campbell, who supports independent candidate Marion Turner-Hawes. Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer\n\nLiz Campbell, who lives opposite, says that since the furore over Bone\u2019s suspension the office exterior has been daubed with pink paint. Wellingborough, she says, deserves better, someone who will champion local issues. She intends to vote for the independent candidate, Marion Turner-Hawes, who is battling to save trees which are under threat in the area. \u201cAnyone but Peter Bone,\u201d she says.\n\nIn contrast to the Tories, Labour\u2019s candidate, Gen Kitchen, a charity fundraiser who grew up in Northamptonshire, has canvassed with the help of about 100 Labour MPs over recent weeks, including Chesterfield\u2019s Toby Perkins, who has been taking a lead political role.\n\nPerkins accepts that \u201cReform is taking a chunk of the vote\u201d but believes that the Tories\u2019 failings both nationally and locally put his party in with a serious chance. \u201cA lot of people feel very let down by politics in general and nationally, but also locally around the area,\u201d he says, referring not only to the Bone case, but also the effective bankruptcy of Tory-run Northamptonshire county council in 2018, as well other controversies.\n\nIt is hard to find much Tory activity on the streets of Wellingborough on a Friday afternoon with just 13 days to go before the vote. But what literature the party is producing shows it recognises Reform is now a serious problem.\n\nA campaign newssheet being put through letter boxes warns that \u201cVoting Reform could let Labour in\u201d. A Reform UK worker said of the newssheet: \u201cBefore, in previous elections, they didn\u2019t even acknowledge us. Now they are talking about us as a threat. That for us is a breakthrough.\u201d"}

Deeply saddened to inform you that we have lost our beloved Poonam to cervical cancer.

Photograph: English Heritage\n\nThis proves that three centuries after his death, the monks at Pontefract Priory considered Thurstan to be a saint, Carter said.\n\nEngland has 173 saints in what the monks at Pontefract would have thought of as \u201cthe holy company of heaven\u201d. How could one of them go missing? Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell have the answer.\n\n\u201cThe destruction during the Reformation is extraordinary, especially at monasteries,\u201d Carter said. \u201cIt\u2019s estimated that no more than 5% of the material possessions of English medieval churches survive and with monasteries that\u2019s probably well below 1%.\u201d\n\nPontefract Priory was also a victim of Cromwell\u2019s dissolution of the monasteries. The last prior and monks left in 1539 and nothing now remains.\n\nYet there is another reason why Thurstan\u2019s sanctity has been overlooked \u2013 his decision to go to Pontefract. Thurstan had made a vow as a young man to ally himself to the order of Cluniac monks so, at the age of 70, his health failing, he resigned as archbishop and went to join the order.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet the canons of York Minster were furious that he decided to die in Pontefract,\u201d Carter said. \u201cCanterbury had a host of archbishops buried within its walls. But none at York Minster, and Thurstan was probably the best candidate.\u201d The snub meant his appeal was probably limited to the monks in Pontefract.\n\nThurstan was born in Normandy in about 1070, the year that William the Conqueror had laid waste to northern England in the so-called harrying of the north, killing tens of thousands of people in what some have described as a genocide.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubting he was a great church politician, and he worked his connections, but he was also deeply devout Dr Michael Carter, English Heritage\n\nThurstan\u2019s father had been a canon at St Paul\u2019s in London and the family returned to England in 1104. Thurstan worked for William II, then his brother Henry I, who decided that his lowly chaplain should become archbishop of York in 1114.\n\nPerhaps Henry had hoped that this rapid elevation would resolve the dispute between York and Canterbury, whose churchmen believed they should be supreme in England. Thurstan disagreed and refused to make a formal profession of obedience to the archbishop of Canterbury. To avoid the king\u2019s fury, he spent the next five years in Europe.\n\nThis made Thurstan a \u201cman of European dimensions\u201d, according to Professor Janet Burton, professor of medieval history at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David and a specialist in medieval monastic and religious orders who wrote Thurstan\u2019s entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.\n\n\u201cDr Carter\u2019s discovery has added an extra dimension to our understanding of Thurstan\u2019s legacy and his place in the religious culture of the medieval north,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThurstan spent the first five years of his period of office on the continent where he enjoyed contact with popes and cardinals, and the leading lights in new, emergent monastic movements.\u201d\n\nA carving of St Thurstan in Ripon Cathedral. Photograph: Ripon Cathedral\n\nThe end of Viking raids and other incursions allowed for greater prosperity across Europe and the birth of the 12th-century renaissance, which saw the flourishing of the universities in Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nOn his return to England, Thurstan resolved the dispute with Canterbury, with the help of the Pope, and spent most of his career promoting the foundation of monasteries, including Byland Abbey, Rievaulx Abbey and Kirkham Priory.\n\nAfter Henry I\u2019s death in 1135, England became embroiled in civil war between Henry\u2019s daughter, Empress Matilda, and his nephew Stephen of Blois. David I of Scotland invaded in 1138 and Thurstan mustered the English army that defeated the Scots at the Battle of the Standard.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubting whatsoever that he was a great church politician, and he worked his connections with the very highest in the land, but he was also deeply, deeply devout,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAfter his death, the monks at Pontefract established Thurstan\u2019s sanctity by exhuming his body two years later and discovered that it was well-preserved, with an odour of sanctity. He was acclaimed as a saint, Carter said, without any need for the Pope\u2019s approval, a process that was not invented at the time.\n\n\u201cThe entry in this manuscript is unambiguous proof that Thurstan was indeed a saint,\u201d Carter said, \u201cand that his name should be seen alongside other religious contemporaries in Northern England, including St William and St Aelred of Rievaulx, St Waldef of Kirkham and Melrose and St Godric of Finchale.\u201d"}

Among them was a one-way video interview system intended to aid recruitment called myInterview. She got a login from the company and began to experiment \u2013 first picking the questions she, as the hiring manager, would ask and then video recording her answers as a candidate before the proprietary software analysed the words she used and the intonation of her voice to score how well she fitted the job.\n\nShe was pleased to score an 83% match for the role. But when she re-did her interview not in English but in her native German, she was surprised to find that instead of an error message she also scored decently (73%) \u2013 and this time she hadn\u2019t even attempted to answer the questions but read a Wikipedia entry. The transcript the tool had concocted out of her German was gibberish. When the company told her its tool knew she wasn\u2019t speaking English so had scored her primarily on her intonation, she got a robot voice generator to read in her English answers. Again she scored well (79%), leaving Schellmann scratching her head.\n\n\u201cIf simple tests can show these tools may not work, we really need to be thinking long and hard about whether we should be using them for hiring,\u201d says Schellmann, an assistant professor of journalism at New York University and investigative reporter.\n\nThe experiment, conducted in 2021, is detailed in Schellmann\u2019s new book, The Algorithm. It explores how AI and complex algorithms are increasingly being used to help hire employees and then subsequently monitor and evaluate them, including for firing and promotion. Schellmann, who has previously reported for the Guardian on the topic, not only experiments with the tools, but speaks to experts who have investigated them \u2013 and those on the receiving end.\n\nNot only do many of the hiring tools not work, they are based on troubling pseudoscience and can discriminate\n\nThe tools \u2013 which aim to cut the time and cost of filtering mountains of job applications and drive workplace efficiency \u2013 are enticing to employers. But Schellmann concludes they are doing more harm than good. Not only are many of the hiring tools based on troubling pseudoscience (for example, the idea that the intonation of our voice can predict how successful we will be in a job doesn\u2019t stand up, says Schellmann), they can also discriminate.\n\nIn the case of digital monitoring, Schellmann takes aim at the way productivity is being scored based on faulty metrics such as keystrokes and mouse movements, and the toll such tracking can have on workers. More sophisticated AI-based surveillance techniques \u2013 for example, flight risk analysis, which considers various signals, such as the frequency of LinkedIn updates, to determine the chance of an employee quitting; sentiment analysis, which analyses an employee\u2019s communications to try to tap into their feelings (disgruntlement might point to someone needing a break); and CV analysis, to ascertain a worker\u2019s potential to acquire new skills \u2013 can also have low predictive value.\n\nIt is not, says Schellmann, that she\u2019s against the use of new approaches \u2013 the way humans do it can be riddled with bias, too \u2013 but we should not accept technology that doesn\u2019t work and isn\u2019t fair. \u201cThese are high stakes environments,\u201d she says.\n\nIt can be hard to get a handle on how employers are using the tools, admits Schellmann. Though existing survey data indicate widespread use, companies generally keep quiet about them and candidates and employees are often in the dark. Candidates commonly assume a human will watch their one-way video but, in fact, it may only be seen by AI.\n\nView image in fullscreen Hilke Schellmann: \u2018These tools aren\u2019t going away so we have to push back.\u2019 Photograph: Jennifer Altman\n\nAnd the use of the tools isn\u2019t confined to employment in hourly wage jobs. It is also creeping into more knowledge-centric jobs, such as finance and nursing, she says.\n\nSchellmann focuses on four classes of AI-based tools being deployed in hiring. In addition to one-way interviews, which can use not just tone of voice but equally unscientific facial expression analysis, she looks at online CV screeners, which might make recommendations based on the use of certain keywords found in the CVs of current employees; game-based assessments, which look for trait and skills matches between a candidate and the company\u2019s current employees based on playing a video game; and tools that scour candidates\u2019 social media outputs to make personality predictions.\n\nNone are ready for prime time, says Schellmann. How game-based assessments check for skills relevant to the job is unclear, while, in the case of scanning a candidate\u2019s social media history, she shows that very different sets of traits can be discerned depending on which social media feed the software analyses. CV screeners can embody bias. Schellmann cites the example of one that was found to be giving more points to candidates who had listed baseball as a hobby on their CV versus candidates who listed softball (the former is more likely to be played by men).\n\nEven vendors may not know precisely how their tools are working, let alone the companies that use them \u2013 or the candidates\n\nMany of the tools are essentially black boxes, says Schellmann. AI let loose on training data looks for patterns, which it then uses to make its predictions. But it isn\u2019t necessarily clear what those patterns are and they can inadvertently bake in discrimination. Even the vendors may not know precisely how their tools are working, let alone the companies that are buying them or the candidates or employees who are subjected to them.\n\nSchellmann tells of a black female software developer and military veteran who applied for 146 jobs in the tech industry before success. The developer doesn\u2019t know why she had such a problem but she undertook one-way interviews and played AI video games, and she\u2019s sure was subject to CV screening. She wonders if the technology took exception to her because she wasn\u2019t a typical applicant. The job she eventually did find was by reaching out to a human recruiter.\n\nSchellmann calls on HR departments to be more sceptical of the hiring and workplace monitoring software they are deploying \u2013 asking questions and testing products. She also wants regulation: ideally a government body to check the tools to ensure they work and don\u2019t discriminate before they are allowed to hit the market. But even mandating that vendors release technical reports about how they have built and validated their tools so others could check them would be a good first step. \u201cThese tools aren\u2019t going away so we have to push back,\u201d she says.\n\nIn the meantime, jobseekers do have ChatGPT at their disposal to help them write cover letters, polish CVs and formulate answers to potential interview questions. \u201cIt is AI against AI,\u201d says Schellmann. \u201cAnd it is shifting power away from employers a little bit.\u201d"}

Today the buildings are established, trees planted, restaurants thriving. The transparent \u201csky pool\u201d, bridging two high buildings, is the epitome of a certain sort of extreme glamour Trump might fancy. Downsides exist, all too easy to ignore. The term \u201cpoor doors\u201d sums up the reality for those who live in adjacent social housing but cannot access the luxury perks on view from their windows. Could music, at least in part, be an answer?\n\nA small music charity next door to the US Embassy, called World Heart Beat, is taking on the Goliath of this multibillion-pound commercial development and trying to make change. Just over a year after opening its doors, its secret needs sharing. The paradox of cutting music education in children\u2019s critical early years, then discovering that it aids brain function later in life, hardly needs spelling out. If it takes research, such at last week\u2019s from the University of Exeter, to attract headlines, so be it. The activities of World Heart Beat only become more timely and vital. This enterprise could be a blueprint for every comparable urban community.\n\nHaving beaten a field of 41 other organisations to become the area\u2019s \u201ccultural anchor\u201d, the charity has taken over a unit at the base of a tower block that might otherwise have ended up as another supermarket. After a bargain \u00a33.6m revamp, it consists of an intimate concert hall, studio, cafe and music academy with practice rooms. An industry-standard sound system makes it a draw for professional recordings. This helps fund the academy, which supports 440 deprived young people from low income, recent migrant and refugee families. The jazz composer-pianist Julian Joseph is a patron.\n\nAround half the students attend free, helped by bursaries and instrument loans. World Heart Beat\u2019s founder and artistic director, Sahana Gero, told me that some teenagers who avoid school are nonetheless willing to commit to the academy, regarding it as a safe place, whether to learn an instrument or to train in any aspect of music performance, including lighting and broadcast technology. (Since 1 in 5 jobs in London are reportedly in the creative economy, this opportunity may prove invaluable.)\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Virtuosic\u2019: James Larter at World Heart Beat Embassy Gardens. Photograph: Sophia Evans/the Observer\n\nThe venue\u2019s public face is a 200-capacity auditorium with a lively concert series (from Cuban jazz to piano recital to funk, played by established performers and rising stars). Last weekend the young percussionist-composer James Larter gave a virtuosic solo programme of his own works \u2013 among them Goroka, with electronics, inspired by the sounds and colours of Papua New Guinea \u2013 and pieces by Michael Gordon, Kevin Volans and Astor Piazzolla. A fugue from a JS Bach violin suite sounded, unbelievably, tailor-made for sticks and marimba. So too did Debussy\u2019s Clair de lune.\n\nHow did Larter, whose teachers include the great solo percussionist Colin Currie, get the gig? He was spotted by Gero when he came to World Heart Beat to play on a recording session for a new album by Boris Grebenshchikov, \u201cfather\u201d of Russian rock music (you already knew that), with Chris Kimsey, one-time Rolling Stones co-producer and a Battersea boy. This is the kind of priceless cultural legacy that gives pride to those five- to 25-year-old local people who walk through the doors as equals.\n\nGero\u2019s task now is to find \u00a3600,000 to keep going until August. World Heart Beat\u2019s annual budget of \u00a31.4m for now relies heavily on donations. The Arts Council provides only 6%. Last week the charity launched a new membership scheme. Starting at \u00a325 a year, it\u2019s a way that those of us who benefited from free music lessons can give directly back.\n\nIn the south and south-west of the country, covering an area of 10,000 square miles with its own economic polarities, Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra has the biggest geographical remit of any UK orchestra. Its Participate programme (including the Recovery Orchestra in partnership with Bristol Drugs Project, dementia-friendly cake concerts, care home performances and work in schools) is of equal importance to an imaginative concert life. Under its popular chief conductor, the Ukrainian Kirill Karabits, the BSO\u2019s longstanding Voices from the East series has been transformative for all. Karabits has coaxed BSO loyals to listen to a range of new repertoire from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and elsewhere: safe to say, much of it unknown to other UK audiences. His 15-year tenure ends this summer after concerts in Poole, London\u2019s Southbank (19 May) and Bristol Beacon (7 June), when he becomes conductor emeritus.\n\nView image in fullscreen Conductor Kirill Karabits, centre, rehearsing with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and soloist Vadim Guzman last week.

Ranging from hymn-like elegy to dissonance to optimism, it propels the soloist to sonic extremes but always reins it back to eloquent, middle-voiced lyricism, underpinned by orchestral strings in rich harmonies. In addition to Mozart\u2019s Serenade (K388 in C minor), crisply played by a wind octet, the whole orchestra \u2013 90-strong \u2013 assembled for Shostakovich\u2019s last symphony, No 15 (1972).\n\nWith its clinical medical beeps (on glockenspiel, woodblock and castanet), its startling snatches of Rossini and Wagner and its chamber-like use of solo instruments, this is Shostakovich at his most enigmatic: mechanical and comic, desperate and lamenting, it is all these, as this superb performance revealed.

At 6.45pm it was announced that she had been sacked by the club after close to 10 months in charge. At 12.30pm the following day, the interim manager, Mikey Harris, was presented to the press. It was a whirlwind 22 hours on the south coast and Phillips\u2019 exit had caused widespread shock.\n\n\u201cThis is not a decision which has been taken lightly, but we feel is vital for the progress we want to see in the Women\u2019s Super League,\u201d said the Brighton technical director, David Weir, in the club\u2019s statement. \u201cWe have invested heavily in the women\u2019s squad and infrastructure going into this season, and results and performances have not been at the level we had expected, given that investment.\u201d\n\nBrighton sit 10th in the Women\u2019s Super League on 11 points after 12 games, having won three, drawn two and lost seven. They are six points above bottom-placed Bristol City and three above West Ham. However, only two points separate the Seagulls and Leicester in seventh. So what has gone so wrong?\n\nAfter Hope Powell left in October 2022, Brighton turned to the German coach Jens Scheuer but concerns over his coaching style meant his tenure lasted only 68 days. His assistant Amy Merricks took interim charge and, in April 2023, with Brighton rooted at the bottom, albeit with two games in hand, in came Phillips.\n\nPhillips\u2019 arrival as manager was as surprising as her exit. The 36-year-old American had left London City Lionesses after leading them to the summit of the Championship in January to join the Los Angeles-based National Women\u2019s Soccer League side Angel City as an assistant coach. Four months later Brighton had lured her back to English football, and two wins and a draw in 18 days secured their survival with three games to play.\n\nIt was an impressive start and Brighton recruited heavily in the summer to arrest the decline of the team that finished sixth in the 2020-21 season and seventh the following year. Ten players came in and 13 departed, including loan deals, and Phillips was in charge of meshing them into a side capable of competing higher up the table. So has the investment not been matched by results and performances?\n\nView image in fullscreen Vicky Losada is among the new players being integrated into the Brighton team this season. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty Images\n\nBrighton have the second-lowest expected goals (xG) figure in the league, but they looked like a side that still learning their identity under Phillips. A point from Manchester United and three against Manchester City are highlights of their campaign and their performances in two league defeats by Chelsea have shown promise.\n\n\u201cThe manager had only been in place since last April, she\u2019s just brought players in the window this January,\u201d said Emma Hayes after Phillips\u2019 departure. \u201cI thought they were a very organised team when we played them last week, but there are a lot of young players in there that take a while [to gel]. Getting into the top three is tough for anyone, we\u2019ve seen the challenges it has posed for Manchester United and they\u2019ve developed a much more experienced squad than Brighton. I was shocked by that decision. Yes, the game is going that way but no one is being paid a million pounds [in women\u2019s football] and to make that decision seemed a little bit quick.\u201d\n\nThe track record of teams that have had a big turnover of players in the summer is not good. When Willie Kirk took charge of Everton in December 2018, the team were bottom. They finished 10th that season, avoided relegation and the following campaign Everton finished sixth and reached the FA Cup final. Spurred on by the rapid rise of the team, nine players came in that summer but after two wins from their opening five games of the 2021-22 season Kirk was sacked.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free newsletter No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women\u2019s football Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Villa lost their opening five league games of the new campaign and sit eighth, just a point above Everton and Brighton.\n\nGelling squads together with wholesale changes is clearly not easy and, critically, there is no quick fix, regardless of the quality of the players incoming. Yes, Brighton signed some good players in the summer, but not of the quality that would walk into the starting XI of any of the top four WSL sides. Maria Thorisd\u00f3ttir joined from Manchester United after failing to impress there, and before that at Chelsea. The goalkeeper Sophie Baggaley also arrived from United but, having been a backup to Mary Earps, had not been playing regularly. Vicky Losada was signed from Roma with plenty of pedigree having played for Arsenal, Barcelona and Manchester City, but at 32 is nearing the end of her career. Pauline Bremer\u2019s Manchester City career was stunted by injury and she made just 24 league appearances across three seasons at Wolfsburg after leaving the WSL to return to Germany.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say if Phillips have been given more time since there are no guarantees she would have been able to turn around Brighton\u2019s fortunes. Increasingly, it seems like impatience is the name of the game in the WSL in a 12-team division where the result of a single game can be critical. That does not help a growing trend of short-term managerial tenures."}

And not just any kind of fast bowling. Bumrah, a telly addict as a kid, said before this series that he was fascinated by the quicks who could send stumps cartwheeling out of the ground with the yorker.\n\nOne suspects a good few others may have been converted watching a compelling second day of this second Test in Visakhapatnam when, at 1.45pm local time, Bumrah took to Ollie Pope\u2019s stumps like a lumberjack. Middle stump jagged left, leg stump flew right, leaving off stump standing there all alone. Pope\u2019s feet were briefly in a different postcode, his bat on the floor, as Bumrah raced past him in sheer delight.\n\nIt was the zing bail-exploding highlight of a day when Bumrah reverse-swung the force firmly in India\u2019s favour and made 1-1 the likeliest outcome heading into next week\u2019s first break.\n\nThe hosts were batting again by the close, a first-innings lead of 143 having swollen by 28 runs without loss. Bumrah was feet-up in the dressing room during a late flurry of boundaries, that smile still beaming about the figures of six for 45 from 15.5 overs that had sent England careering to 253 all out.\n\nKuldeep Yadav would probably like a word here, the left-arm wrist spinner with the Harry Houdini haircut having picked the lock of England\u2019s bright start \u2013 Ben Duckett caught off the shoulder of the blade at silly point \u2013 and finished with three for 71. Playing in the absence of Ravindra Jadeja, Yadav\u2019s array of low-slung gyroscopic fizzers from that rarely seen angle was certainly a point of difference during this cascading collapse.\n\nBut there was no usurping India\u2019s headline unorthodox act, Bumrah\u2019s whip-crack action sending the ball snaking this way and that either side of tea and lacking any known anti-venom. This was the 30-year-old\u2019s second five-wicket haul in what is remarkably just his sixth Test at home, the best of which \u2013 though less jaw-dropping than Pope\u2019s demise for 23 \u2013 being the working over of Joe Root that ended with an outfoxed nibble to slip on five.\n\nEngland had been feeling pretty chipper before all this. Jimmy Anderson crisply helped as the visitors nipped out the last four India wickets before lunch, some early grumpiness at Ravichandran Ashwin for his position at the non-striker\u2019s end eased by figures of three for 47. Though Yashasvi Jaiswal turned his sparkling overnight 179 into 209 \u2013 a maiden double for this elegant young left-hander, celebrated like Jude Bellingham \u2013 India, 396 all out after resuming on 336 for six, had many wondering if they were still light.\n\nView image in fullscreen England\u2019s captain, Ben Stokes, plays a sweep on his way 47 runs. Photograph: Manish Swarup/AP\n\nSuch thoughts only continued when the tourists raced to 110 for one in 22 overs by the afternoon drinks, Zak Crawley having purred his way to 76 in a bevy of punched straight drives and two slog-swept sixes. But once he skewed Axar Patel\u2019s third delivery after the restart high to backward point, the emergence of Root, and with the ball having already started to move late for seamer Mukesh Kumar, Rohit Sharma whistled for Bumrah.\n\nFirst went Root, his front pad probed a la Hyderabad before the one that moved away. Then came the most alarming demise of a Pope since John VIII was poisoned and strangled by his clerics back in the ninth century. This was the yorker Bumrah honed as a child while aiming for the skirting boards at home and trying not to wake his sleeping mother, not that anyone could have dozed through the noise that met this one.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week\u2019s action Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But once Bumrah returned refreshed he soon teased another edge to slip from a Yorkshireman, once again underlining the secondary threat that thoughts of his trademark ball can induce.\n\nAs the crowd erupted once more, Stokes could be seen grimacing at the other end, the crows feet soon deepening further as Yadav fiddled out two more. Ben Foakes played around one to be bowled for six and Rehan Ahmed tamely toe-ended to midwicket for the same score. Yadav\u2019s threat looks likely to increase once India have set the fourth innings equation, with inconsistent bounce this pitch\u2019s likeliest threat.\n\nIt was what did for Stokes, Bumrah\u2019s fourth and final burst terminating a defiant 47. For the second time this series, leaving the England captain visibly asking \u201cwhat could I do?\u201d, a low one having pegged back off stump. It was a question his lower-order colleagues were never going to be able to answer sufficiently, Tom Hartley\u2019s punchy 21 another to be ended at slip and Anderson pinned in front lbw by the inswinger.\n\nAll that was left was for Sharma and Jaiswal to compound the situation, Anderson once again strapping on the bowling boots with little respite to speak of. England wriggled free from a greater first innings deficit in the first Test and Crawley was speaking this language after stumps. Deciphering the way Bumrah gets a reverse-swinging cricket ball to talk remains a significant issue, however."}

Restaurants tempt the lunchtime crowd with sticks of grilled wagyu, boiled crab legs and, for dessert, plump strawberries encased in chewy mochi rice.\n\nBut there are indications that Tsukiji\u2019s multinational clientele are not always on their best behaviour. Signs in English implore them not to eat outside storefronts or leave their litter behind. Staff hold aloft signs reminding diners where to queue for their 12-piece, \u00a52,700 (\u00a314.40) sushi lunch. Here, as in many other popular destinations around the world, booming tourism is a double-edged sword.\n\nAlmost a year after Japan lifted all pandemic travel restrictions, foreign visitors are back with a vengeance, drawn by a weak yen, world-beating cuisine, and the promise of a holiday of a lifetime in a country that was once considered a tourism backwater.\n\n\u201cEverything is cheap, the service is incredible, and the food is the best you\u2019re going to have, and at a fraction of the price you\u2019d pay in America,\u201d said Tommy Buchheit, an American who was visiting Japan for the first time.\n\nThose and other attractions tempted 25.8 million foreign visitors to Japan last year, according to immigration authorities \u2013 a sixfold rise from 2022. Together they spent a record \u00a55.3tn (\u00a328.3bn), according to the Japan Tourism Agency. Japan\u2019s government wants more, setting an ambitious goal of 60 million visitors \u2013 and \u00a515tn of spending \u2013 by the end of the decade.\n\nBut critics say Japan is ill prepared for higher tourist numbers, citing even more strain on accommodations, public transport and the service industry, at a time when the country is battling an acute labour shortage.\n\nIn his vision for a new \u201ctourism nation\u201d, prime minister Fumio Kishida said sustainable tourism depended on welcoming visitors without adversely affecting the quality of life for local people. Proposals outlined by the government last year include boosting the number of buses and taxis, raising public transport fares during peak hours, and opening new bus routes.\n\nIt also earmarked 11 \u201cmodel\u201d destinations, including rural eastern Hokkaido and the sub-tropical island of Okinawa, it hopes will draw visitors away from Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, which together accounted for 64% of overnight stays by foreign visitors in the first eight months of last year. The stress will be less on consumption and more on cultural immersion, from experiencing mountain asceticism and Zen meditation, to making pottery and sak\u00e9.\n\nView image in fullscreen A sign encouraging good behaviour among tourists at Tsukiji market in Tokyo. Photograph: Justin McCurry/The Observer\n\n\u201cTourism pollution\u201d is most visible in Kyoto, Japan\u2019s ancient capital and home to some of the country\u2019s most famous temples and shrines, and the geisha district of Gion. In 2022 the number of tourists visiting Kyoto exceeded 43 million \u2013 about 30 times the city\u2019s population.\n\nPeter MacIntosh, a longtime Canadian resident who organises geisha-themed walking tours, said residents were struggling to reconcile the disruption caused by hordes of visitors with a dramatic uptick in spending.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that people here want the best of both worlds \u2013 to have a quieter life and make money \u2013 but it is only going to get worse as more people arrive. Kyoto is becoming a free-for-all,\u201d said MacIntosh, who added that tour groups of up to 40 people were not unusual.\n\nThe boom has seen less well-known locations wrestling with travellers eager to gather social media content. They include a railway crossing in Kamakura, southwest of Tokyo, which has been inundated with fans of Slam Dunk, a popular manga comic and anime TV series about high school basketball. The crossing, which appears in the anime\u2019s opening credits, is considered a \u201csacred site\u201d among fans.\n\nSome local authorities are taking matters into their own hands, amid concern that overtourism is damaging sites of historical and ecological interest.\n\nVisitors to Itsukushima Shrine, a Unesco world heritage site, must pay \u00a5100 (53p) admission, while later this year, tourists heading to the Taketomi islands will be charged an as-yet undecided sum to help protect their pristine beaches.\n\nFrom this summer, visitors planning to hike to the summit of Mount Fuji, another Unesco site, will be charged \u00a52,000 (\u00a310.70), as local authorities attempt to take the strain off crowded trails trodden by more than 5 million people in 2019.\n\n\u201cJapan has become a bucket-list destination,\u201d said Karl\u00ffn de Bruin, who was visiting Tokyo from the Netherlands with her father and brother. \u201cI can imagine that local people get fed up, so we try to mind our own business. But you can feel the social media vibe \u2026 people dressing up and taking photos in certain ways because it makes good content.\u201d\n\nKenichi Kond\u014d, a Tsukiji fishmonger, was beaming as he served grilled fillets of black cod to hungry passersby. \u201cOur takings are up tenfold compared to a couple of years ago,\u201d said Kond\u014d, whose business has occupied the same spot for more than 50 years. \u201cFirst we had a lot of people from North America and Europe, but now they are mainly from Southeast Asia, and we\u2019re expecting a lot of Chinese visitors when they celebrate their new year soon.\u201d\n\nWhile he welcomed the shot in the arm tourism has given his store\u2019s 10 employees, Kond\u014d conceded that littering had become a big problem. \u201cWe try to get around that by offering to take people\u2019s rubbish off them if they buy our fish. There are exceptions, but the tourists here are generally well behaved.\u201d\n\nLizzie Jones, an American on her fourth trip to Japan, was sanguine about the crowds she encountered at Tsukiji on an unseasonably warm February day. \u201cYou expect it when you do all the touristy things \u2026 when you come to this market you know it\u2019s going to be packed.\u201d\n\nBut like many locals, she took exception to litter louts and nuisance influencers who trample on local customs and treat busy locations like their personal photo studio.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a generational thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first few times I came here, there was no trash and now there\u2019s a lot. There\u2019s also a sense of an entitlement \u2026 people do whatever they want and don\u2019t teach themselves about local customs. They don\u2019t care.

Later photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Hair and makeup: Jessica Mejia. Archive photograph: courtesy of Sarah Greene\n\nBorn and raised in Cork, in the south-west of Ireland, the theatre, film and television actor Sarah Greene was just six years old when she first stepped on stage, performing in local musical theatre and pantomimes. She later attended Cada Performing Arts school in Cork and then the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin, from which she graduated in 2006.\n\nGreene\u2019s interpretation of Helen in Martin McDonagh\u2019s The Cripple of Inishmaan in 2013 earned her Olivier and Tony award nominations, while her screen credits include Bad Sisters, Normal People, Vikings and Dublin Murders. Now 39, she lives in London and Belfast with her partner and son. Greene is currently starring in Sexy Beast on Paramount+.\n\nWhen I was five years old, I was cast as the Virgin Mary in the infants\u2019 school nativity play. With my blue cape and stern expression, I took the role incredibly seriously. I was very much in character as a committed mother. I actually still have that Tiny Tears doll at my family home in Cork, although she\u2019s missing a lot of hair. When I wasn\u2019t performing, I liked to give her locks a chop. Particularly the fringe.\n\nThe following year, it was decided that the school would give another child a chance at Mary. The teachers thought it would be a good idea to pull the name of the next girl to play the role out of a hat. When they did that, it was Sarah Greene, yet again. I was Mary two years in a row, much to the disdain of some of the other girls\u2019 mothers. It was a real drama, a proper controversy.\n\nEven though I was young, I had already realised that acting was my ambition. Around this time, my parents had got me tickets in the dress circle to see Cinderella at Cork opera house, and while I was watching it, all I could think about was how I longed to be with the actors on stage. You wouldn\u2019t have guessed it to meet me back then; I was very quiet and super shy, far from an extrovert. I found interactions with people I didn\u2019t know agonising. I have memories of my mum asking me to go into the supermarket on my own and absolutely hating it. Acting helped my confidence grow. What I loved most was putting on masks and being able to express myself through other characters.\n\nAt the age of six, I entered a talent competition. My solo performance was Miss Hannigan in Annie and I really threw myself into it \u2013 walking around the stage holding an empty bottle of vodka and wearing my mum\u2019s high heels. Everyone was terrified I would trip up and break my ankles, but I adored pretending to be this drunk woman singing Little Girls. I came second and it was all the encouragement I needed to know this was the life for me. Being on stage was where I felt my best self.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a people-pleaser. When I look at this photo, I see a little girl who wants to be someone\u2019s best friend\n\nMy childhood was very outdoorsy: running around the fields and woods that surrounded the old farmhouse I grew up in. When my parents originally bought it they had no intention of becoming farmers, but they inherited lots of potbellied pigs, cats and dogs from the previous owner \u2013 chickens, too. We didn\u2019t even eat their eggs as we considered them our pets. It was all very wholesome.\n\nMy mum was a stay-at-home mother and my dad worked in telecommunications, and still does. Even though acting was an unknown profession to them, they were unbelievably supportive, especially as there were a few teachers who would complain because I was missing so much school \u2013 although I wasn\u2019t lagging behind.\n\nFrom a very young age I was driven, and my parents encouraged me at every step because they were so relieved I\u2019d found something I was passionate about. I\u2019ve made sure they have always come along for the ride \u2013 they have joined me at awards shows and when I\u2019ve been performing in New York and filming in France. They have been there for the less glamorous jobs, too. I remember my dad coming to see me when I was in a not very good play in Dublin. At the end, he was the only person giving a standing ovation. Afterwards, I said: \u201cOh no! Dad, you didn\u2019t need to stand.\u201d He said: \u201cI\u2019ve always stood, and I always will stand for you.\u201d\n\nI had worked for years in Irish theatre, and had done a couple of films along the way, but it wasn\u2019t until The Cripple of Inishmaan that film and TV really opened their doors to me. The Tony nomination put me on the map. I was up against some phenomenal talent, so I wasn\u2019t worried that I would have to get up on the platform and give a speech, but it was a brilliant and surreal night \u2013 and something that totally changed the course of my career.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The first time I remember being rejected by a production and feeling hurt was when I was 10. I had auditioned for the Cork Operatic Society\u2019s production of The Sound of Music, and had to sing Happy Birthday \u2013 which is actually a really hard song to sing. I didn\u2019t get it, and was heartbroken. Devastated. My parents said: \u201cIf this is the job you want to do, you\u2019re going to have to get used to that.\u201d There are still times when I\u2019m quite sad about not getting a role, but I\u2019ve since come to realise that it\u2019s often nothing to do with your talent \u2013 it\u2019s what you look like, your height or something fundamental that is completely out of your hands.\n\nWhen it comes to surviving the entertainment industry as a woman today, it certainly feels like the landscape is changing for the better. I\u2019ve been fortunate to be consistently surrounded by inspirational women throughout my career: when I was doing panto and plays as a child, I was performing with a lot of female actors from different generations, who taught me so many skills and opened me up socially.\n\nI became a mum a few years ago and it has definitely exposed me to new emotions. However, before I had my son, I\u2019d already explored maternal roles: first as Rosie in the 2018 film of the same name; and then as Lorraine in Normal People. I was on set on the first day of filming Normal People, and from the opening scene I realised that Paul [Mescal] and Daisy [Edgar-Jones] were electric and that we were in the presence of something great. Quite rightly, they have since become superstars, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want their level of fame. I like to be able to sit in a restaurant, eat some food, and for no one to look at me. I want to be able to have a conversation and not feel like I am being eavesdropped on. The older I get, the more I just want to do my job, come home, see my little boy and try to get him to bed.\n\nI don\u2019t put up with crap any more. I\u2019m very capable of speaking my mind if I think something\u2019s not right, which I didn\u2019t do so much when I was younger, as I was scared to rock the boat and lose the job.\n\nNot that I have much cause to speak out at the moment \u2013 I\u2019m in the middle of shooting the new series of Bad Sisters, so I\u2019m surrounded by incredibly powerful, smart, supportive women every day on set. From our lord and saviour Sharon Horgan, the genius that she is, to its directors and producers, the whole show is female-led, which I find really sexy and exciting.\n\nWhile I care less what people think of me, I am, and always have been, a bit of a people-pleaser. When I look at this photo, I see a little girl who wants to be someone\u2019s best friend. I\u2019d love to go back and give her a hug, and tell her life\u2019s going to be cool and that even though it sometimes feels like she\u2019s the shyest kid in the room, she\u2019s not so quiet any more."}

It\u2019s mid-January and Neil Tennant arrives at London\u2019s Somerset House in a black corduroy blazer and black rollneck, and likens bandmate Chris Lowe\u2019s lateness to something out of Gormenghast. When our synthpop Titus eventually appears in a grey Adidas hoodie, minus the sunglasses that have made him pop\u2019s most mysterious foil, the former architecture student is expounding on illogical new changes to the layout of the Strand.\n\nWe locate a conference room and they liaise with their publicist on a \u201chalf-time\u201d provision of drinks and cakes. In their east London studio HQ, says Lowe, 64, they like \u201cthat big, thick chocolate bar \u2013 something-baloney?\u201d Aside from their Tony\u2019s Chocolonely compulsion, they also frequent a nearby deli, where \u201cI also buy 100% rye bread,\u201d says Tennant, 69, segueing into a customarily arch conspiracy. \u201cThere is, by the way, out there a much bigger market for 100% rye bread than they supply. Wherever you go, they\u2019ve sold out. Why don\u2019t you make more?\u201d\n\nOf course, they are spoiled for rye bread when working in their other studio, in Berlin \u2013 their last album, 2020\u2019s Hotspot, was inspired by lunchtime trips to techno club Berghain. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing Duolingo!\u201d Tennant announces. \u201cTwo years \u2026 \u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s virtually fluent now,\u201d says Lowe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d says Tennant. He remains foxed by the \u201csheer randomness of gender\u201d in the German language. He studies on the train, and \u201cif you\u2019re sitting next to me, I\u2019m going: \u2018Agh! Gah!\u2019 every five minutes.\u201d\n\nYou could bathe in this: the repartee, theories, references; how Tennant, a former editor, italicises as he speaks. In the 40 years since they released their beguiling debut single West End Girls, the Pets have been pop\u2019s most culturally voracious band. Their immaculate synthpop packages emotion in cosmopolitanism, characterising love and loss via Italian subcultures, the Bolshevik uprising and David Lodge novels. They suggest that it is through culture that we make sense of our lives, and here, if you like, are some more songs by which you might do so.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018We\u2019re the only people daft enough to do it\u2019 \u2026 the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 Inner Sanctum show at Royal Opera House, London, 2016. Photograph: Ken McKay\n\nThe Pets\u2019 entwinement with our cultural subconscious seems stronger than ever, from their 2022 Glastonbury Other stage headline set to two recent film syncs \u2013 Rent in Saltburn, sung in a tragic karaoke rendition by a young man living the song\u2019s complex enmeshing of desire and dependence, and two spots in Andrew Haigh\u2019s All of Us Strangers, portals to memories of queer loss and hedonism. And pop seems to buoy Tennant and Lowe in a perpetual present: they discuss the 1988 Frankie Knuckles remix of I Want a Dog that appears in Haigh\u2019s film with such immediacy, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re still poring over the cassette in the back of the stretch limo that took them to the DJ\u2019s New Jersey studio. When the BBC approached them about making a new Imagine documentary, they suggested an idea of Lowe\u2019s. \u201cI would like to make a film using our music as a sound bed for what\u2019s happened in our Pet Shop Boys lifetime,\u201d he says. \u201cCovering New York in the 80s, Tiananmen Square, homelessness.\u201d (The actual film, due in spring, is more conventional.)\n\nThe latest chapter would, naturally, include Covid: Hotspot arrived in January 2020, and they had to mothball their greatest hits tour a few months later. But they never worried it was all over. Lowe suggested Tennant learn how to program, so \u2013 alone in his house in the Kent countryside \u2013 Tennant downloaded Garageband, bought a keyboard, \u201cwatched a YouTube film for about 10 minutes, it was boring\u201d, and embarked on a prolific songwriting streak. Lowe, who caught the last train out of London to what he obliquely calls \u201cthe country\u201d (\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I actually could get out, I was a bit panicky\u201d) sent tracks back and forth, and they took to working remotely. They trusted touring would return because during the plague \u201cthe theatre didn\u2019t die\u201d, says Lowe.\n\n\u201cQuite the reverse,\u201d says Tennant.\n\nTheir magnificent Dreamland tour eventually started in 2022 and concludes this summer. And they brought their lockdown fruits to a new producer, James Ford, having rated his knack for strings on albums by the Last Shadow Puppets and Arctic Monkeys. \u201cAlso being in Simian Mobile Disco, we knew he was really good at analogue synth programming,\u201d says Lowe. \u201cThe combination of those two things is basically the sound of the Pet Shop Boys: electronics with strings.\u201d\n\nThe result, new album Nonetheless, is gorgeous: buoyant with optimism, it basks in songwriterly lusciousness after a trilogy of harder albums with producer Stuart Price, Electric (2013), Super (2016) and Hotspot. Newcastle-born Tennant and Blackpool-born Lowe stress the northern emphasis on the \u201cNone\u201d. It\u2019s a reference to their post-lockdown persistence: \u201cNonetheless! We\u2019ve carried on and done this,\u201d says Tennant. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more profound than that.\u201d\n\nOnly one song specifically references lockdown, Why Am I Dancing?, which touches on Tennant\u2019s makeshift kitchen dancefloor. What did he dance to? \u201cDance records,\u201d he says mysteriously.\n\n\u201cKylie!\u201d Lowe interjects, as he opens the window. Tennant reveals that Lowe can do the Padam Padam dance, maintaining his tradition of learning every important pop dance. Disappointedly, he declines to demonstrate.\n\nOtherwise, its 10 songs follow characters all going for it, chasing idylls, romantic and artistic salvation, certain they\u2019ve unlocked the secret of happiness. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d Tennant says when I point it out.\n\nEverything is about money in a weird way, and therefore everything\u2019s mainstream immediately Neil Tennant\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take that,\u201d says Lowe.\n\n\u201cIs that something to do with lockdown?\u201d Tennant muses. \u201cReaching out? Dunno \u2013 just what comes out.\u201d\n\nThere are a few personal moments among the character studies: New London Boy updates Bowie\u2019s The London Boys as Tennant\u2019s origin story, documenting his move to London in the early 70s, where the red-haired, stiletto-wearing graduate got a job in the manuscripts department of the British Museum. \u201cI get a flat with friends, we\u2019re all dressing up, you\u2019re wondering about your sexuality,\u201d Tennant says. He calls it \u201cwhat happens between verses two and three of Being Boring,\u201d their 1990 retrospective about living through friends dying of Aids. But New London Boy is all present tense, defiant and dreaming, sparked by glam and flashing forward, in a classic Tennant rap breakdown, to the New York dance records that would bring he and Lowe together. \u201cIt\u2019s done in the style of an early 80s Grandmaster Flash rap,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is the rap style that comes naturally to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna do Cardi B, are you?\u201d says Lowe (although Cardi B is, famously, a fan). \u201cLotta words required.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Wig out \u2026 Running with the dogs for Nightlife, 1999. Photograph: Eric Watson\n\nThe album is full of these promised lands. Lead single Loneliness offers a stern hand out of a sad sack\u2019s self-imposed solitude. The romantic A New Bohemia is filled with yearning for artistic sanctums of yesteryear. Dancing Star is an ecstatic hymn to Russian ballet dancer and KGB escapee Rudolf Nureyev, who Tennant watched a documentary about. He repeats a line referencing the swinging 60s that Nureyev joined: \u201cWhen the streets of London sang with pop stars / Well the truth is that they always do.\u201d\n\nDo they still? Celebrating these scenes, Nonetheless comes off as a loving eulogy for them. \u201cIt\u2019s not as true as it used to be,\u201d Tennant admits.\n\nWe met by chance, we started writing songs. It\u2019s sort of remarkable, so it\u2019s best not to dwell on it too much Neil Tennant\n\n\u201cIn the 90s of course, you\u2019d see all the Britpop lot everywhere,\u201d says Lowe. \u201cAnd in the 80s they\u2019d all be in the Camden Palace.\u201d\n\nThey knew everyone in the 90s, says Tennant. \u201cThere was a scene. We\u2019d all go down the Groucho Club, basically. It was a very fun period. It extended out into art galleries, ballet. And now I don\u2019t feel we have that in our lives.\u201d A New Bohemia, he says, \u201cis actually quite a heartfelt statement\u201d. Today, \u201ceverything\u2019s about money, in a weird way, and therefore everything\u2019s mainstream immediately\u201d.\n\nNonetheless, says Tennant, \u201cwhen you\u2019ve been doing it a long time, you think about what you want. As you get older, I don\u2019t like that idea of giving in.\u201d\n\nSince the pandemic, the Pets have also noticeably been going for it: the greatest hits tour; a US jaunt with New Order; reissues of Chris Heath\u2019s brilliant books documenting their early tours; a Radio 2 documentary; a BBC retrospective; Smash, their fourth singles compilation; the upcoming Imagine documentary. It\u2019s striking for a band not given to nostalgia, though Tennant insists \u201cit\u2019s just \u2018doing catalogue\u2019 \u2013 we don\u2019t really sit around looking back.\u201d (Lowe is so disinclined to look back that he made his father cry on his first day of primary school by striding into class without giving him a second look, Tennant says.) At most, he says, it leaves them wondering why such-and-such a song wasn\u2019t a single and marvelling that a song as \u201codd, very dark and so gay\u201d as 1990\u2019s So Hard was.\n\nThey also re-signed with Parlophone, the label they left in 2013 when protracted contract negotiations prompted them to try label services company Kobalt. It was a great run, but Parlophone \u201cwanted us back\u201d, says Tennant. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a nice feeling.\u2019\u201d They even spent two years developing a new all-gender fragrance \u201cwith a really top perfume designer\u201d, he adds. \u201cHe really wanted to get electricity into the smell. We couldn\u2019t work out what that meant.\u201d But they don\u2019t know what happened to it. \u201cUltimately all of our albums would be a perfume.

I think it\u2019s slightly more musky.\u201d\n\nNonetheless is a marked development from their last Parlophone record, 2012\u2019s beautiful but melancholy Elysium, a slightly defeated collection about becoming invisible as older men and musicians, also made in the wake of the deaths of Tennant\u2019s parents. In 2022, the Pets helmed a Palace fashion advert alongside Joan Collins, now 90; a Loewe advert starring Maggie Smith, 89, recently went viral. Madonna, 65, is no longer lambasted for ageing, but triumphantly touring her Celebration retrospective. Have attitudes to older people changed in the past decade?\n\nView image in fullscreen Diva patrol \u2026 the duo\u2019s duet with Dusty Springfield, 1987. Photograph: Eric Watson\n\n\u201cWeirdly, music ceased to be ageist,\u201d says Tennant, as various chocolate cakes arrive and the pair produce an astonishing amount of crumbs. \u201cYoung people are listening to their parents\u2019 records. It\u2019s all up for grabs.\u201d He credits YouTube. \u201cYou could have a fond memory of seeing the video for Strawberry Fields Forever on Top of the Pops in 1967, and then you never saw it again. But I could look at it now. Something happened then. It all existed at the same time.\u201d They crashed into this last year when Drake released a song with an unlicensed quotation of West End Girls, which Tennant found out about through a young nephew: \u201cHe was quite impressed, actually.\u201d It got sorted after a cross tweet. \u201cThey were very helpful and apologetic,\u201d says Tennant. Did they get paid? \u201cOh we certainly did.\u201d\n\nHe ventures a theory. \u201cI think pop stars have managed to do what we used to think only old blues musicians could do \u2013 turn into sort of \u2018authentic\u2019, classic \u2026 I think the public accept that. You could call it nostalgia, but I think it\u2019s a desire to witness an authentic movement recreated. Age doesn\u2019t seem to matter any more because the music doesn\u2019t seem to have aged.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s unlikely to be a specific retirement point. You\u2019ll just suddenly think: \u2018Oh, we haven\u2019t seen them for a while\u2019 Neil Tennant\n\nApril marks 40 years of West End Girls \u2013 albeit the Bobby O-produced original, not the famous 1985 Stephen Hague hit \u2013 though famously the Pets met three years prior in a Chelsea hi-fi shop. That happenstance meeting seems even more magical in an age where meeting strangers usually involves an app. Lowe was eyeing up unaffordable equipment. Tennant had bought a synthesiser without realising it lacked an in-built speaker, and needed a connector. \u201cWhat amazes me about that is that the man welded a jack plug to the prongs to go in my 1970s stereo port,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a smell of welding.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the scent of electricity that their perfumer was looking for. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think of that,\u201d says Tennant, surprised.\n\nThey don\u2019t like to analyse why their relationship has endured. \u201cTo analyse something might be to destroy it,\u201d says Tennant. \u201cI think there\u2019s an acceptance of the inevitability of it. We met by chance, we started writing songs. It\u2019s sort of remarkable, really, so it\u2019s best not to dwell on it too much.\u201d\n\nWhile Nonetheless is filled with dreamers, reality nibbles their toes. The Schlager Hit Parade is a very funny, bell-heavy song about the German postwar pop explosion that willed happiness and prosperity into being. \u201cGesundheit to Europa! / Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s gonna last \u2026 \u201d Tennant cheers. And Bullet for Narcissus imagines the perspective of Trump\u2019s bodyguard, accepting he must die for a man he hates. On the possibility of a Trump second term, Tennant says: \u201cIt\u2019s the undiscussable.\u201d\n\nThe flip of the idylls on Nonetheless is, of course, escapism. \u201cAt the moment, everything\u2019s awful,\u201d he says, save technological advances. \u201cTrump, Putin, all these ghastly, supposed strongmen, all the stupidity and hostility that informs that.\u201d He has a rosier view on the relitigation of gay rights. \u201cI was having a discussion with a friend and he said: all this will have to be fought for again. I don\u2019t agree \u2013 I think it\u2019s the success of the gay agenda that arouses hostility. And those people are reactionary losers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cabout time\u201d for a British election, he says. \u201cWhen they write the history of the Tory administration from 2010 to 2024, it will go down as one of the worst in history. Because when you look at what we\u2019ve gone through \u2013 for what reason, really? \u2013 it\u2019s led us to Brexit, the whole Covid thing, the gap between rich and poor.\u201d The problem with Labour, he says, \u201cis there\u2019s always a row going on \u2013 \u2018it\u2019s not left enough\u2019, \u2018they\u2019ve got to get voted in\u2019. In my opinion, the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn was to get Boris Johnson elected. When you\u2019re of my generation, it just seemed weird, like you were attempting to go back to the politics of the 1970s, whereas what you want to do is take the socialist agenda in a way that leads you forward into a bright future.\u201d\n\nHe wonders if society has lost a sense of collectivism. \u201cIt\u2019s only really defended with people talking about the NHS. People have to work collectively.\u201d He sees it in Jon Savage\u2019s new book about how LGBTQ resistance shaped culture. Even being in a club \u2013 rapidly disappearing from British high streets \u2013 \u201cis ultimately a collective experience\u201d.\n\nPolitics is unhealthy, says Tennant, because of \u201cthe corruption and self-victimising\u201d. It ties back into their new single, Loneliness, practically a confrontation of the isolation epidemic that particularly affects older people. Tennant turns 70 this summer, and stresses that curiosity and community are key to remaining vigorous. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be interested,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t become a victim of yourself. It\u2019s just really, really unhealthy.\u201d (It\u2019s something he admires in Troye Sivan\u2019s latest album: \u201cIt\u2019s so unbelievably queer, but in a great way. I\u2019ve never liked self-victimhood and there\u2019s nothing self-victimising about Troye Sivan.\u201d)\n\nPet Shop Boys: Loneliness \u2013 stream Spotify\n\nMaybe that innate optimism is the key to the album\u2019s yearning. \u201cWithin me there\u2019s always been a sense of unfulfilled longing. Which is not really fair to me because it has been fulfilled quite often!\u201d Yet it\u2019s always there, he says: \u201ca default position of longing for something different or something better\u201d.\n\nOn whether he can imagine doing this at 80, he says there\u2019s \u201cunlikely to be a specific retirement point. You\u2019ll just suddenly think: \u2018Oh, we haven\u2019t seen them for a while.\u201d\n\nThis year, however, there is much business to attend to. In addition to the ongoing tour, there\u2019s another run at the Royal Opera House, after one in 2016. \u201cWe\u2019re the only people daft enough to do it,\u201d says Tennant. Although they wrote two albums\u2019 worth of new songs, there won\u2019t be Nonetheless part 2. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got is a whole stage show called Naked, based on The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes,\u201d says Tennant. \u201cIt\u2019s tune-central!\u201d (Why Am I Dancing? rewrites a ballad from the show.)\n\nBut, says Lowe, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hold your breath for that! That might be posthumous at the rate it\u2019s going.\u201d The idea of a world without the Pets in it is not worth thinking about. At least their vision \u2013 of innocence and opportunity \u2013 has left this one a little better.\n\nIt is time for a meeting about the new album. Before they go, Lowe rummages in the abandoned bag of cakes, that Pets hunger as insatiable as ever. But someone has beaten him to it. \u201cNeil\u2019s nibbled them all!\u201d\n\nNonetheless is released on Parlophone on 26 April Pet Shop Boys Dreamworld: The Greatest Hits Live at the Royal Arena Copenhagen is in cinemas on 4 February.

Photograph: Family handout/AP\n\nJenkinson\u2019s family, saying their lives had been left \u201cin turmoil\u201d, thanked Brianna\u2019s mother for her \u201cincredible selflessness and empathy towards our family\u201d.\n\n\u201cHer compassion is overwhelming and we are forever grateful,\u201d they said. \u201cTo all of Brianna\u2019s family and friends, our community and everyone else that has been affected by this horror, we are truly sorry.\u201d\n\nJenkinson, 16, had \u201cenjoyed\u201d the killing and found the thought of violence \u201csexually arousing\u201d, Manchester crown court heard.\n\n00:01:23 Teenagers sentenced to life in prison for murder of Brianna Ghey \u2013 video\n\nRatcliffe had expressed transphobia in relation to the victim, Mrs Justice Yip ruled.\n\nYip said Jenkinson was motivated by a \u201cdeep desire to kill\u201d and pronounced her concern on hearing that the teenager had \u201cexpressed the desire to kill again\u201d after her conviction. After her detention, she had written a new \u201ckill list\u201d, which included the names of some of her carers, the court heard.\n\nTo both defendants, the judge said: \u201cYou picked Brianna because you both thought she would be an easy target.\u201d\n\nYip warned the pair they may never be released if they \u201cremain a danger\u201d. Though Jenkinson pleaded not guilty to the murder, Manchester crown court heard that since her conviction she had admitted taking part in the stabbing, having previously blamed Ratcliffe for the murder.\n\nJenkinson told a psychiatrist she had stabbed Brianna \u201crepeatedly\u201d and had found it \u201cexciting\u201d because she thought Brianna would stop being her friend. She murdered Brianna so she would \u201calways be with her\u201d, the court heard.\n\nJenkinson, who was obsessed with serial killers, also admitted to the psychiatrist that she \u201cintended to take parts of Brianna\u2019s body as a token\u201d. She had previously told Ratcliffe she wanted to keep Brianna\u2019s \u201cpretty eyes\u201d.\n\nThe court heard that Brianna was stabbed 28 times but there was no evidence that the killers took body parts."}

Hojbjerg leathers the ball clear and play is stopped so Richarlison can receive treatment after getting an accidental elbow to the head from Tarkowski. On the touchline, Sean Dyche is furious.\n\n\n\n2m ago 09.02 EST 69 min: Maddison plays the ball wide to Kulusevski, who slips it inside to Richarlison, who had found a pocket of space on the edge of six-yard box. He looks a certainty to complete his hat-trick but his rising drive is kept out by an excellent Pickford save. The Everton goalkeeper is keeping his side in the game.\n\n\n\n5m ago 08.59 EST 68 min: A speculative Godfrey effort from a few yards outside the Spurs penalty area is savedcomfortably by Vicario.\n\n\n\n6m ago 08.58 EST 65 min: Young tries to curl the ball on to Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s head from the byline but his delivery is headed clear by Tarkowski. Spurs break upfield and as Ben Godrey tries to clear the ball from down by the corner flag, Richarlison shapes to challenge him but pulls out of the tackle. Despite not having been touched by the Brazilian, Godfrey throws himself to the ground, holding his ankle. Richarlison is understandably annoyed with these histrionics.\n\n\n\n9m ago 08.55 EST 63 min: Tottenham double-substitution: Dejan Kulusevski and Pape Sarr on for Brennan Johnson and Rodrigo Bentancur.\n\n\n\n11m ago 08.53 EST 60 min: Ben Godfrey is booked for protesting about something or other and moments later, Richarlison has a curled effort blocked by James Tarkowski. The game is being played at a frantic pace and while Spurs are dominating, Everton are far from out of it.\n\n\n\n14m ago 08.50 EST 59 min: James Maddison latches on to a headed Godfrey clearance on the edge of the Everton penalty area, gets the ball out from under his feet and shoots. Jordan Pickford is forced to save again.\n\n\n\n15m ago 08.49 EST 57 min: Brennan Johnson curls a ball from the right into the path of Timo Werner but the German hesitates slightly and is unable to get in front of Godfrey, who intercepts the pass. If he\u2019d continued his run, Werner almost certainly would have got a shot off on goal or at least won a penalty. View image in fullscreen Ben Godfrey thwarts Timo Werner. Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 08.51 EST\n\n17m ago 08.47 EST 54 min: Playing off the shoulder of Ben Godfrey, Timo Werner is played in behind by a James Maddison ball from deep. He\u2019s clean through on goal in a one-on-one with Jordan Pickford but his low shot is straight at the onrushing goalkeeper, who gets down to save comfortably. Poor Timo should have scored but you always felt he wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\n\n20m ago 08.45 EST 53 min: Van de Ven shows amazing recovery speed to get back and dispossess Dwight McNeil in the Spurs penalty areas after the Everton winger had been played in behind by a ball from deep.\n\n\n\n21m ago 08.44 EST 51 min: Maddison pulls a low cross into the Everton penalty area and the ball is put out for a corner. Nothing comes of it, although VAR have told the referee they\u2019ll be checking for a possible penalty after somebody \u2013 Gueye, perhaps \u2013 appeared to wrestle Van de Ven to the ground as the ball came in. No spot-kick is awarded.\n\n\n\n23m ago 08.42 EST 50 min: Pedro Porro shoots from distance and his effort is on target. Jordan Pickford dives to his left to save one-handed.\n\n\n\n24m ago 08.41 EST 49 min: Spurs throw-in, halfway inside their own half as a scrappy opening to the second half continues. Everton win the ball, get it forward to Harrison and he spots Vicario a few yards off his loan. His ambitious attempt to lift the ball over the Spurs goalkeeper is way off target.\n\n\n\n25m ago 08.39 EST 48 min: Cristian Romero tries to play the ball out from the back but is closed down by Calvert-Lewin and the ball goes out for a goal kick.\n\n\n\n26m ago 08.38 EST Second half: Everton 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur 46 min: Play resumes and it seems Jack Harrison has been officially awarded Everton\u2019s goal, in a state of affairs that seems unlikely to sit well with Dominic Calvert-Lewin, whose header might have brushed against Harrison on it's way in from all of a yard out. That\u2019s harsh but the Everton striker\u2019s goal drought goes on.\n\n\n\n30m ago 08.34 EST An email: \u201cRe: the Everton goal,\u201d writes Stephen Holliday. \u201cHarrison is clearly backing into Vicario. He\u2019s not just standing still. So Vicario should be stronger? By putting his hands on Harrison to get him out of the way and then wait for the inevitable dive while Harrison could be stronger?\u201d Now that Vicario is painfully aware that some, if not all match officials are not going to penalise the Jack Harrisons and Ruben Diases of this world for backing into him at corners, he simply has to find a way of stopping them. Whether that\u2019s standing firm in the face of their movement (as he did when saving from Ben Godfrey), getting out of their way and letting them reverse into the back of the net, or positioning a defender between himself and whoever is tasked with marking him is entirely up to him. He\u2019s a very good goalkeeper but his apparent weakness in the face of being man-marked at corners has been identified as a weakness andd Tottenham need to do something about it.\n\n\n\n39m ago 08.25 EST Half-time: Everton 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur Peep! The whistle goes for half-time and Tottenham Hotspur lead courtesy of two splendid goals from Richarlison, who is certainly enjoying his return to his old stomping ground. Dominic Calvert-Lewin ended a 16-game goal drought to score Everton\u2019s goal and it was no surprise that it came about as a result of Tottenham goalkeeper Vicario being bullied at a corner. It is a strategy Everton have employed since the beginning of the game and almost bore dividends again towards the end of the first half. It\u2019s been a very entertaining game that could still go either way.\n\n\n\n43m ago 08.22 EST 45+5 min: Another Everton corner means more drama. Vicario punches clear under pressure from Harrison. Jarrod Brantwaithe swings at the breaking ball but James Maddison gets between him and the ball to block the shot and win his side a free-kick. That hurt.\n\n\n\n44m ago 08.20 EST 47+4 min: That corner was won by Everton when Idrissa Gueye selfishly elected to shoot when he would have been far better served squaring to an unmarked Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the middle.\n\n\n\n46m ago 08.18 EST 46+1 min: Everton go close to restoring parity at another corner, this time leaving Vicario to his own devices as the ball comes in. The Spurs goalkeeper is called into action to scramble the ball clear with his feet from a Ben Godfrey header as Jack Harrison reversed into him. Excellent goalkeeping.\n\n\n\n48m ago 08.16 EST 43 min: The build-up to that goal was sensational, with Tottenham attacking up the left side of the field and what looked like about six different players \u2013 Udogie, Werner, Porro and Maddison among them \u2013 all involved as they sliced through the Everton defence. Shifting his weight from one foot to other while surrounded by oppositon players, James Maddison teed up Richarlison with a splendid short pass.\n\n\n\n51m ago 08.13 EST GOAL! Everton 1-2 Tottenham (Richarlison 41) Spurs retake the lead! It\u2019s a wonderful team goal rounded off by a spectacular individual finish from Richarlison. The Brazilian picks up a short pass from Maddison before sidefooting ta right-footed effort into the top corner from distance. It\u2019s a wonderful finish but once again he decides not to celebrate in front of Goodison Park\u2019s Gwladys Street End. View image in fullscreen Richarlison hides his glee after scoring a cracker. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters\n\nUpdated at 08.18 EST\n\n54m ago 08.10 EST 39 min: Everton win a free-kick directly in front of the Spurs goal about 35 yards out, for a Van de Ven shove in the back of McNeil. It\u2019s too far out for anyone to shoot and ultimately nothing comes of the set-piece.\n\n\n\n1h ago 08.08 EST 36 min: Spurs break upfield on a counter-attack but Jarrod Brantwaithe cuts out a through-ball aimed in the direction of Richarlison. It\u2019s end-to-end at the moment, with the game being played at a helter-skelter pace.\n\n\n\n1h ago 08.06 EST 34 min: \u201cThe goalkeeper has got to be stronger!\u201d is the general consensus among the TNT Sports pundits and I\u2019m certainly inclined to agree with them. Alternatively, Tottenham need to put a defender between their goalkeeper and any oppositon players before the ball is delivered at corners. It\u2019s not like they haven\u2019t had prior warning about what might happen in this and other recent games.\n\n\n\n1h ago 08.03 EST 32 min: The goal survives a VAR check despite Vicario\u2019s now customary fury. He claims that Jack Harrison was backing into him as the ball was delivered from the corner and perhaps the Everton forward was, but referee Michael Oliver and his VAR Stuart Attwell see nothing wrong with the goal.\n\n\n\n1h ago 08.01 EST GOAL! Everton 1-1 Tottenham (Calvert-Lewin 30) 29 min: It\u2019s another corner for Everton and Jack Harrison gets tight on Vicario. Tarkowski heads the ball across the face of goal from the far post and Calvert-Lewin ducks to head home from a yard out.

Ashley Young has been the guilty party on a couple of occasions and overhits another cross from the right touchline here.\n\n\n\n1h ago 07.58 EST 27 min: Everton have yet to muster a scoring opportunity of note but have had the better of the past 15 minutes after their terrible start.\n\n\n\n1h ago 07.56 EST 24 min: Spurs block another ball driven into the penalty area by Mykolenko and Tarkowski clears. Everton win another corner that curlswide at the far post despite the best attempts of Dominic Calvert-Lewin to get his head to it. On this occasion, it\u2019s Jack Harrison who is tasked with man-marking Vicario as the ball comes in.\n\n\n\n1h ago 07.53 EST 22 min: Dominic Calvert-Lewin is played in behind down the inside left and drifts inwards towards goal. Showing an impressive turn of foot, Micky van de Ven gets back to block the shot before the ball leaves the Everton striker\u2019s foot. View image in fullscreen Micky van de Ven foils Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA\n\nUpdated at 07.56 EST\n\n1h ago 07.52 EST 18 min: Vitaly Mykolenko drills the ball across the middle of the Spurs penalty area, Dwight McNeil shoots iand his goal-bound effort is blocked by Jack Harrison, his own teammate. Harrison\u2019s blushes are spared by an offside in the build-up \u2013 Mykolenko as he ran on to a ball over the top from Idrissa Gueye.\n\n\n\n1h ago 07.48 EST 15 min: Everton corner. Not for the first time in recent memory, Vicario is crowded out by assorted oppositon players as the ball comes in, but manages to get two hands to it and clear. James Tarkowski seems to be the Everton player tasked with marking the Spurs goalkeeper at corners in this game, following the success of Manchester City\u2019s Ruben Dias in the role a week ago yesterday.\n\n\n\n1h ago 07.45 EST 13 min: Pierre-Emilie Hojbjerg is penalised for a foul on Dwight McNeil after Brennan Johnson had avoided sanction for a robust challenge on James Garner. It\u2019s spicy out there.\n\n\n\n1h ago 07.43 EST 10 min: It being the 10th minute, Everton fans hold up their placards of protest and loudly boo the Premier League. While you have a measure of sympathy for them, it\u2019s worth noting that their club is a founding member and current stakeholder of the organisation they\u2019re protesting against, and they did plead guilty to the charge of financial shenanigans laid against them.\n\n\n\n1h ago 07.40 EST 9 min: A low, diagonal James Maddison shot from the edge of the Everton penalty area takes a nick off Tarkowski and fizzes wide of the far post. It\u2019s a corner for Spurs but nothing comes of it.\n\n\n\n1h ago 07.39 EST 8 min: Having scored his goal, Richarlison shaped to wheel away in celebration before stopping himself and signalling apologetically to Everton\u2019s fans, who warmly applaud him forhis good manners. It\u2019s comically performative nonsense from all concerned.\n\n\n\n1h ago 07.37 EST 6 min: Pierre-Emerick Hojbjerg plays a nice little give-and-go with Brennan Johnson down the left wing, then Timo Werner does the same with Destiny Udogie. From the byline, the Spurs left-back pulls the ball back to the unmarked Richarlison, who volleys high into the net from the corner of the six-yard box.\n\n\n\n1h ago 07.34 EST GOAL! Everton 0-1 Tottenham Hotspur (Richarlison 4) Spurs lead! It\u2019s a fine first-time strike from Richarlison, who elects not to celebrate against his former team.

Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters\n\nUpdated at 07.37 EST\n\n2h ago 07.33 EST 3 min: Tottenham get some time on the ball and ping it around the middle third as they feel their way into the game. The visiting fans serenade Micky van de Ven, as Destiny Udogie tries to square the ball for James Maddison on the edge of the Everton penalty area.\n\n\n\n2h ago 07.32 EST 2 min: A crossfield pass from James Tarkowski is headed clear by Pedro Porro and the ball finds its way bvack to Guglielmo Vicario in the Spurs penalty area.\n\n\n\n2h ago 07.31 EST Everton v Tottenham Hotspur is go ... 1 min: Michael Oliver signals the start of proceedings and Everton get the ball rolling. They play in their customary home kit, while the players of Spurs are a vision in beige shirts, shorts and socks.\n\n\n\n2h ago 07.28 EST Not long now: The Z-Cars sirens and theme tune soundtrack the arrival of both sets of players out on the pitch, prompting Everton fans to hold up their yellow protest signs. Thousands have been distributed and the Goodison Park stands are a sea of English mustard. Kick-off is just a couple of minutes away.\n\n\n\n2h ago 07.24 EST Everton protests: Still unhappy at their club being docked 10 points for failing to comply with Premier League finance and sustainability rules (a charge they admitted), Everton fans are planning another protest today. They will hold up yellow cards boasting the PRemier League logo and the slogan \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d during the Premier League anthem and on the 10-minute mark of today\u2019s game. The club await news of their appeal against the 10-point penalty and are due to find out if it has been overturned, reduced or rejected later this month.

His opposite number, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, by contrast, can\u2019t buy a goal and hasn\u2019t scored in his past 16 appearances for Everton. Brought in from Udinese to help out up front, the Portuguese striker Beto has managed just two league goals in 17 appearances since his arrival in August.

That\u2019s the only change in Sean Dyche\u2019s line-up from the team that drew with Fulham on Tuesday. Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglous makes two changes to the team that started against Brentford in midweek. Brennan Johnson and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg come into the side, with Oliver Skipp and Dejan Kulusevki making way. Pape Sarr is among the substitutes following his return from Afcon.\n\n\n\n2h ago 06.35 EST Everton v Tottenham Hotspur line-ups Everton: Pickford, Godfrey, Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Mykolenko, Young, Gueye, Garner, McNeil, Harrison, Calvert-Lewin.

Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland)\n\n\n\n3h ago 06.14 EST Early team news Everton midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure is back in training after returning from a thigh injury but this game has almost certainly come too soon for him. Seamus Coleman has been rated as little more than \u201ca maybe\u201d as he continues his recovery from a similar ailment. Andre Gomes has been ruled out, while Arnaut Danjuma and Amadou Onana will undergo late fitness tests. Idrissa Gana Gueye is available for selection after returning from Senegal\u2019s unsuccessful mission to retain their Africa Cup of Nations crown. Gueye\u2019s compatriot Pape Sarr is also back from international duty with Senegal and could start in midfield for Tottenham, but Heung-min Son (Asian Cup) and Yves Bissouma (Afcon) are both still unavailable. Manor Solomon, Ryan Sessegnon and Giovani Lo Celso are all sidelined with injury.

The report was damning about the culture of the first-class counties, describing \u201cinstances of violent and degrading behaviour\u201d towards female staff. One witness reported being forced to lock herself in her office to avoid sexual harassment by the club\u2019s male cricketers; another, being called \u201can \u2019effing butch\u201d by a colleague after she raised the issue of gender equity in a meeting.\n\nSo goes county cricket in the 21st century. In the light of this, the decision of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) \u2013 in a radical shake-up of the domestic system announced this week\u2013 to hand over control of women\u2019s cricket away from the independent regions back to the counties may seem questionable.\n\nIt makes more sense to turn such thinking on its head and realise that this plan is as much about men\u2019s cricket as it is about the women. \u201cFundamentally this is a growth plan for cricket,\u201d Beth Barrett\u2011Wild, the ECB\u2019s director of the women\u2019s professional game, said. \u201cBy making this transition, we have an opportunity to really galvanise cultural change through the game.\u201d\n\nAnother clue is in the title of the bid document \u2013 \u201cEvolving Together\u201d \u2013 that has been sent to the 18 first-class counties and the MCC, who are being invited to submit tenders to host one of the eight professional women\u2019s teams. Winning bids will need to demonstrate a commitment to embedding equal opportunity at all levels of the club: what better way to weed out toxic masculinity?\n\nThe ECB appears to have learned something from the ICEC\u2019s criticism of the lack of representation of women within cricket\u2019s decision-making structures: the voices of female cricketers have been front and centre while plans for the women\u2019s professional game mark II were made, via consultation with the women\u2019s player committee of the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association (PCA).\n\nOne member of that committee, the Northern Diamonds\u2019 Katie Levick, says this change feels very different from the transition into the new regional structure in 2020: \u201cIn 2019 our [Yorkshire] season finished and we had no idea what was happening. Over the years, we\u2019ve always wondered who is making these choices for us, so to be sat at the table and directly feeding back at every stage of the process was amazing.\u201d\n\nClearly there are details still to be ironed out. Facilities will be an especially thorny issue. County grounds are at capacity and the women\u2019s game will \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 demand visibility on the sport\u2019s biggest stages. One source close to the women\u2019s regional game summed up the issue: \u201cUnless there\u2019s money to build another facility, we\u2019re going to have to do a lot of sharing.\u201d Men in cricket have not always been very good at that.\n\nLancashire Thunder\u2019s Phoebe Graham, another member of the PCA women\u2019s committee, agrees. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be training outside the hours of nine to five,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the graveyard shift in a sports hall because that\u2019s where the counties can fit us in. That\u2019s not where we\u2019re at any more. We need to be more of a priority.\u201d\n\nGraham cites Lancashire as an example of good practice in this regard: by treating the NorthWest Thunder as if they were Lancashire Women, they have generated the kind of belonging lacking elsewhere. \u201cThe men and the women train at Emirates Old Trafford as our main ground,\u201d Graham says. \u201cThey have been able to create joint commercial opportunities through Hilton and through Sportsbreaks, by promoting the club as one team.\n\n\u201cIf anything, Lancashire has probably forced the ECB\u2019s hand by showing how well this model does work.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week\u2019s action Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There must be a risk that some counties pay lip service to developing women\u2019s cricket, win the right to host a tier one side and then use the \u00a31.3m annual ECB investment to fund their men\u2019s teams.\n\nLast year\u2019s Karen Carney review found that the practice of diverting money that was meant to be ringfenced for women\u2019s football back into the men\u2019s game was widespread. The ECB says there will be robust processes in place to ensure that does not occur within cricket, but details are as yet thin on the ground.\n\nAbove all, the new model needs to be a success. Undertaking three major upheavals of women\u2019s cricket in eight years has already undermined the ECB\u2019s credibility: failure is simply not an option this time around."}

Archaeologists working at Vindolanda, a Roman garrison site south of Hadrian\u2019s Wall in Northumberland, have unearthed fresh evidence that the Romans also brought us ... bedbugs.\n\nDr Andrew Birley, who heads the Vindolanda archaeological team, said: \u201cIt is incredibly rare to find them in any ancient context.\u201d\n\nThe discovery was made by Katie Wyse Jackson 24, a University College Dublin (UCD) student working on the excavated material as part of her research masters in archaeoentomology, the study of insects at archaeological sites.\n\nFocusing on one of Vindolanda\u2019s lowest layers, which dates to around AD100, she recovered two thoraces believed to have come from the common bedbug known by its Latin name, Cimex lectularius. With needle-like mouthparts, they pierce the skin of humans to suck their blood.\n\n\u201cFinding this kind of thing helps humanise the people of the past,\u201d said Wyse Jackson. Noting that Pliny, the Roman philosopher, wrote of the medicinal value of bedbugs in the treatment of certain ailments, such as ear infections, she added: \u201cPeople then had all sorts of notions of what insects could do.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Archaeologists digging at Vindolanda Roman garrison site in Northumberland, where the remains of the common bedbug were found. Photograph: Stephen Dorey/Alamy\n\nThe specialist team included Dr Stephen Davis, a lecturer in environmental archaeology at UCD. He said that there is one other Roman site in England where these were previously found \u2013 Alcester in Warwickshire - but the Vindolanda ones would be \u201cthe earliest found in Britain so far\u201d.\n\nIn analysing soil samples, she has also found beetles that can give further insights: \u201cI can learn about trade, food storage, hygiene, waste disposal from what species are present and in what numbers. At the moment, I\u2019m finding a large amount of grain and dung beetles.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re really not looking at a clean space here. Most importantly, a large proportion of the insects I\u2019m finding are what we call synanthropic. They live in close proximity to humans.\n\n\u201cThe Romans do have that reputation as being extremely clean and so it\u2019s interesting to find all of these insects that are contrary to that.\u201d\n\nOne theory is that the Romans brought bedbugs to Britain in their straw mattresses. Wyse Jackson said: \u201cIt\u2019s very likely they came with whatever the Romans were bringing over. Today, we see bedbugs travelling on aeroplanes in luggage, in clothes. \u201cThe Romans were bringing over clothes, straw, grain in great quantities as they were setting up their camps. So it\u2019s the perfect opportunity for one or two bedbugs to hitchhike over.\u201d"}

As Ten Hag seeks to impress Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the club\u2019s new 25% shareholder, United were in seventh place before this weekend\u2019s fixtures with 35 points after 22 games, with a goal difference of -4.\n\nTen Hag\u2019s Premier League campaign is fast threatening to overtake the annus horribilis of David Moyes\u2019s 34-league match tenure of 2013-14. When the Scot was sacked on 22 April of that season, United had 57 points and were also in seventh. They ended with 64 points, 22 behind the champions, Manchester City.\n\nAs United host West Ham on Sunday their 1.59 points per match has them on course to finish with 60. Moyes at least had been bolstered in his winter window by Juan Mata\u2019s arrival from Chelsea for a then club record \u00a337.5m. This January, there was not enough cash down the back of the United sofa for any cut-price loan deals, unlike 12 months ago when Wout Weghorst from Burnley, Marcel Sabitzer (Bayern Munich) and Jack Butland (Crystal Palace) were signed.\n\nOn Thursday, Kobbie Mainoo\u2019s 97th-minute winner at Wolves handed United a euphoric 4-3 victory but came after they allowed a two-goal lead to slip for the second consecutive match, following on from Sunday\u2019s 4-2 FA Cup win at Newport County.\n\nA concerned Ten Hag said: \u201cWe should have managed the situation better.\u201d It is the tale of the campaign and clearly the squad is riven by faultlines.\n\nThe first-choice goalkeeper, Andr\u00e9 Onana, was shaky again at Wolves and has cost too many points this season, while his private jet journey to the Africa Cup of Nations the day before Cameroon\u2019s opening match seemed to underscore his farcical season. The plane was forced to land a three-hour drive away and he did not play against Guinea. Starting the next game, against Senegal, Onana made another goal-conceding error and was dropped for the rest of the tournament.\n\nOnana is at least one of the few United players unfamiliar with the crammed treatment room. All four full-backs \u2013 Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Diogo Dalot, Tyrell Malacia and Luke Shaw \u2013 and the five centre-backs \u2013 Lisandro Mart\u00ednez, Rapha\u00ebl Varane, Victor Lindel\u00f6f, Jonny Evans, and Harry Maguire \u2013 have suffered injuries. What must bother Ten Hag is whether, Shaw and Mart\u00ednez apart, any are good enough for where he wishes to take United.\n\nThe midfield also requires serious surgery. Mason Mount has been a regular absentee due to two unspecified conditions and his 12 appearances have been tepid. The loanee Sofyan Amrabat has underwhelmed while a knee problem has hampered an ageing Christian Eriksen, 32 on Valentine\u2019s Day, and he, like others, has contended with illness.\n\nThe club\u2019s second-highest earner, Casemiro, is not the player of last season and recently returned from an ankle problem, while Ten Hag\u2019s assessment of Scott McTominay was indicated by his being for sale in the summer. Donny van de Beek\u2019s disappointing four years have led to his second loan move \u2013 to Eintracht Frankfurt \u2013 and, after 10 appearances, Ten Hag decided Hannibal Mejbri can also play elsewhere until the close season: Sevilla.\n\nTwo bright lights are Bruno Fernandes, United\u2019s best player, and Mainoo, whose strike at Wolves followed an FA Cup goal at Newport, but the forward unit is still a work in progress: not ideal at this juncture of the season.\n\nOn the books are nine attackers: Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Anthony Martial, Alejandro Garnacho, Facundo Pellistri, Amad, Mason Greenwood and Rasmus H\u00f8jlund. Four \u2013 Rashford, Sancho, Antony and Greenwood \u2013 have been embroiled in off-field problems, and three \u2013Greenwood, Sancho and Pellistri \u2013 farmed out.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty Images\n\nRashford was dropped for the Newport game after missing training on the previous Friday after allegedly partying in Belfast into the early hours of that morning. He has five goals and six assists. Antony was given leave of absence in September to address allegations about his private conduct, which he denies, and did not start seven matches. The goal at Newport broke his duck for the season after 23 appearances. Greenwood is on a year-long deal at Getafe having not pulled on a United jersey since January 2022, for well-known non-football reasons.\n\nIn August, Sancho made three substitute appearances (total, 76 minutes) before joining Borussia Dortmund in January for the rest of the season after clashing with his manager. Pellestri, a 22-year-old middling talent, went on loan for a second time \u2013 to Granada \u2013 last month, after no goals in his 14 games, while Amad has played once \u2013 for 36 minutes in the defeat at Nottingham Forest on 30 December.\n\nIn his eighth United season, Martial has two goals in 18 matches and is out for about three months after groin surgery. Slightly better are the five goals in 30 outings from Garnacho and the 10 in 26 from the \u00a374m summer arrival, H\u00f8jlund.\n\nTen Hag has to carry the can for some of United\u2019s dysfunctionality as he is in charge of team style, ironing out the in-game management he bemoans, and oversaw the signings of Antony, Onana, Casemiro, Malacia, Mount, Evans, Amrabat and Eriksen. But Ratcliffe may still take into consideration all that the manager has had to firefight and cut him some slack, though for how long is open to question.\n\nIf Ten Hag is to survive until the next transfer window his fate is intertwined with a lurching group of players who have won consecutive Premier League games twice this season. Against West Ham he has to start improving this record."}

Fog has crept in, blurring the outline of Polarstern, the German icebreaker moored to a kilometre-long ice floe at 85 deg N latitude. Next to a hole we have just drilled through 1.4 metres of ice, Morten Iversen, who studies the flow of carbon around the ocean, has attached several plastic containers to a rope secured by ice screws. They will be left hanging in the water under the ice for a day to catch marine snow \u2013 clumps of dead algae and zooplankton faeces that sink from the upper ocean to the deep sea.\n\nA few metres away, a team of biologists perforate the ice floe with a core drill. They are looking for algae that grow at the bottom of sea ice, which play an important role in the Arctic Ocean food web. Metre-long ice cores are pulled up, packed in plastic sleeves and stacked on a sledge to be processed in the ship\u2019s laboratories.\n\nView image in fullscreen Daniel Scholz, an engineer for the Alfred Wegener Institute, lowers an instrument that measures temperature, salinity and nitrate \u2013 an important nutrient for algae and phytoplankton \u2013 through an ice hole\n\nView image in fullscreen View image in fullscreen Clockwise from top left: nets to collect zooplankton; the ship\u2019s helicopter carries a sensor to measure ice thickness; Emiliano Cimoli, a researcher at the University of Tasmania, right, and an Alfred Wegener Institute technician Erika Allhusen, drill an ice core to look for sea-ice algae; Frederik Bussmann, a marine chemist and PhD student at AWI, measures the salinity at the edge of an ice floe\n\nOne of the scientists is keeping watch, with a rifle slung over her shoulder and a flare gun on her belt. This is, after all, a polar bear habitat \u2013 albeit a shrinking one.\n\nOur group is part of a 100-strong expedition \u2013 half of them scientists, half ship\u2019s crew \u2013 that set out from the Norwegian harbour of Troms\u00f8 in early August 2023 to investigate the rapid melting of the Arctic sea ice. The team is investigating the consequences for the marine ecosystem: from nutrient cycling to ice algae and plankton productivity to seafloor animal communities that live on organic material raining down from the surface ocean.\n\nView image in fullscreen An ice core drilled from sea ice in the central Arctic Ocean\n\nThe central Arctic is heating up much faster than most of the world. The area covered by sea ice in the Arctic Ocean at the end of summer has shrunk by about 40%, or 2.5m square kilometres \u2013 roughly the size of the Mediterranean Sea \u2013 since satellite observations began in the late 1970s. The remaining ice is getting thinner and multi-year floes \u2013 ice that has survived at least one summer \u2013 are becoming rarer. The waters around the north pole could be virtually free of ice at the end of the summer as early as the 2030s, according to a recent study.\n\nShrinking ice cover means not only the loss of hunting grounds of polar bears or resting places and nurseries for seals, but also of an entire under-ice ecosystem: meadows of filamentous ice algae, algae-grazing zooplankton, and juvenile polar cod, which find food and shelter in the cracks and crevices beneath the floes and, when grown up, feed larger predators such as ringed seals or beluga whales. In the short term, sea ice productivity could increase as more sunlight passes through thinner floes, boosting ice algae growth, but only as long as there is a sufficient supply of nutrients in the overall nutrient-poor central Arctic Ocean.\n\nThe same goes for planktonic algae, or phytoplankton, which profit from higher light availability and a longer growth season in the expanding open-water areas, as satellite data shows. Changes in productivity and a shift from ice algae to phytoplankton at the base of the food web will probably have major effects on the marine ecosystem as whole. Also, the native flora and fauna are facing new competition from invasive species, from plankton to fish, that are moving in from the Atlantic and Pacific as the oceans warm. Predictions of the future Arctic Ocean are, however, highly uncertain due to a general lack of observation. That is why the scientists have come here.\n\nView image in fullscreen View image in fullscreen Tiny Arctic life, clockwise from top left: A 3cm-long ice amphipod (Onisimus); a 4cm pelagic sea slug, or sea angel (Clione limacina); a 2cm jellyfish (Botrynema brucei); and a 1cm copepod (Paraeuchaeta)\n\nThe chief scientist of the expedition, Antje Boetius, has been exploring the frigid waters of the Arctic for three decades. In summer 2012 her team witnessed the lowest sea-ice minimum on record, in the Arctic Ocean\u2019s Eurasian Basin.\n\n\u201cNow, we are following the same route to repeat previous measurements on the ice-ocean system all the way down to the seabed,\u201d says the deep-sea ecologist, who is also director of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany.\n\nThe ice-covered Arctic Ocean, especially its deeper realms, is one of the least explored regions on Earth. To catch a glimpse of larger creatures inhabiting the abyssal plains on the ocean floor and uncharted underwater mountains, the deep-sea ecologists have brought a camera system that is towed behind Polarstern.\n\nView image in fullscreen Polar bears are an occupational hazard on the Arctic ice\n\nThe abundance and diversity of life in this cold, dark and food-scarce environment is truly astonishing: in places, large numbers of sea cucumbers and huge colonies of filter-feeding feather stars appear in the spotlights. We marvel at basketball-sized sponges flickering across the scientists\u2019 screens, at apricot-coloured anemones and star-shaped patterns extending around the burrows of spoon worms, which lick the seabed for food particles with a metre-long tongue.\n\nPolarstern regularly moors alongside large floes and part of the science team heads out on to the sea ice, pulling sledges heavily loaded with drilling tools and other equipment.\n\nView image in fullscreen The expedition leader, Antje Boetius, on Polarstern\u2019s bridge\n\nFlags on bamboo poles set up by a scouting party mark routes to different research sites. Meanwhile, the ship\u2019s helicopter passes over them, with a torpedo-shaped sensor suspended below it that measures the thickness of the sea ice.\n\nThe rhythm of life onboard is determined by how fast the ship gets through the ice, the schedule for the research expeditions, and, most reliably, meal times: breakfast at 7.30am, lunch at 11.30am, coffee at 3.30pm, dinner at 5.30pm.\n\nThe scientists work around the clock, and often use any time off to catch up on sleep after a long night in the lab or outside on deck in freezing temperatures. Yet they still find time for social activities in the evenings, be it card games in the cosy red salon, water basketball in the ship\u2019s swimming pool, or a pub quiz in the bar.\n\nView image in fullscreen Towards the end of the expedition, when Polarstern is going south and the sun disappears below the horizon again after weeks of polar day, powerful spotlights are used to navigate through the ice\n\nAlthough the sea ice coverage in the study area and in the Arctic Ocean overall is higher in 2023 than in previous years, the expedition makes good progress. We encounter thicker \u2013 but quite old and rotten \u2013 ice that Polarstern easily breaks through, and large gaps of open water between the floes.\n\nAnd so, on 7 September, almost effortlessly, the ship reaches the northernmost point of the planet: the geographic north pole.\n\nFor most onboard, it is the first time; for Polarstern it is the seventh time. In 1991, with the Swedish ship Oden, it was the first conventional icebreaker to reach the latitude 90 deg N.\n\nThe Arctic Ocean has changed dramatically since that first arrival, says the captain, Stefan Schwarze. \u201cThree decades ago, we needed two icebreakers to fight our way through the pack ice,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, we have reached the north pole with 30% of our engine power.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Armed guards keep a lookout for polar bears while their colleagues work"}

However, our investigation has discovered the technology has had serious issues from the beginning, sometimes crashing unexpectedly and losing all notes from interviews, or even whole days of evidence, so that inspectors have to replace those notes from memory without telling the school.\n\nThe Observer spoke to several current or recent inspectors on condition of anonymity who said such problems had been \u201ccommon\u201d for years, and that senior leaders within Ofsted were aware of this, but \u201cthere has been a lot of covering up\u201d.\n\nAfter this story was initially published a spokesperson for Ofsted told The Observer that chief inspector Sir Martyn Oliver \u201cis initiating a rapid review to satisfy himself that the EEG and the guidance to inspectors is robust\u201d. The spokesperson added that if schools or inspectors have concerns \u201cwe would want to hear about them directly, so we can respond appropriately\u201d.\n\nDaniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cThis has echoes of the Post Office scandal. The idea of inspectors making lost evidence up, or remembering what they can, is abhorrent. It\u2019s not how schools are allowed to conduct themselves.\u201d He argued that if such a practice has been commonplace, \u201cessentially every inspection conducted over the past five years should be disregarded\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018This has echoes of the Post Office scandal\u2019: Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union.

The advice is that you mustn\u2019t let on and keep an inscrutable face.\u201d\n\nHe recalled sitting in a hotel trying to input a day\u2019s evidence after the system shut down and he lost everything: \u201cYou\u2019re exhausted because the inspection day is long and non-stop and you have documents to read for the next day.\u201d\n\nOnce colleagues at headquarters wanted to do a \u201crigorous check\u201d on an \u201cOutstanding\u201d grade he had just given a school. \u201cThey were asking for evidence but it just wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been a lot of covering up.\u201d\n\nA second former inspector des\u00adcribed how he sat and watched as evidence from a lengthy interview \u201cjust disappeared bit by bit from the screen, like a Banksy artwork self-destructing\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to avoid giving any body language clues while that\u2019s happening.\u201d And he added: \u201cThe instruction then was just to make it up.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI know for a fact that there are senior leaders in Ofsted who know about these problems.\u201d\n\nOfsted conducted an investigation into EEG last year, which inspectors say confirmed serious issues, but none was aware of any significant changes being made in response.\n\nEducation providers have largely been totally unaware of any of these problems. However, the Observer has seen Ofsted\u2019s written response to a complaint from a school about missing evidence. It says: \u201cYou state that during the final meeting the lead inspector declared: \u2018It\u2019s all gone\u2019, referring to the evidence on her computer.\u201d\n\nThe response also notes that the draft report included a school motto \u201cwhich was not actually your school motto\u201d, and that the school had \u201clittle confidence in the evidence base\u201d.\n\nOfsted rejected this, saying the lead inspector logged that the record of the final meeting had gone but all other evidence was recorded and \u201csubject to enhanced quality assurance\u201d. The Observer understands the school was never shown evidence of this.\n\nA third former Ofsted inspector said: \u201cI lost everything in the middle of a meeting with a coordinator at the start of a deep dive [into the teaching of a specific subject]. The lead inspector lost everything when she got back to the hotel that night, as did the new inspector on the team.\u201d\n\nThree inspectors reported that they or colleagues started making notes in Word because they didn\u2019t trust the system, but Ofsted threatened disciplinary action if they didn\u2019t use EEG.\n\nJulie Price Grimshaw, a former inspector who now advises schools, said while she served in the pen-and-paper era, \u201clots of inspectors\u201d had told her about times when the system crashed and they lost evidence.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that substantial chunks, and possibly entire evidence bases, have been disappearing into the ether and are never seen again.\u201d\n\nOfsted said that if the EEG system did not work, inspectors were advised to record their evidence in a \u201creasonable alternative way\u201d and \u201ctransfer it to the system at the earliest opportunity\u201d. Ofsted\u2019s spokesperson added: \u201cIf during the quality assurance process there was insufficient evidence on the system to support the judgment, inspectors would be instructed to return to the school to gather and record further evidence.\u201d"}

She has pledged to be a first minister \u201cfor all\u201d, unionists as well as nationalists, and to show respect to the royal family.\n\nYet the 47-year-old comes from an IRA family, defends the legitimacy of IRA violence, and honours IRA members who died during the Troubles. How she navigates the tension between these positions will shape her tenure at the helm of an executive that faces immense challenges after two years of political paralysis.\n\nO\u2019Neill should have become first minister in May 2022 after Sinn F\u00e9in overtook the Democratic Unionist party in an assembly election. But the DUP boycotted power-sharing in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements, leaving Stormont mothballed until a deal with the government coaxed it back this week.\n\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in deputy leader will head an executive with a DUP deputy first minister who has equal power but less prestige. The two parties, in coalition with Alliance and the Ulster Unionist party, inherit a fiscal crisis, crumbling public services, creaking infrastructure and widespread cynicism about Stormont\u2019s capacity to fix things. Republicans will want progress towards unification, while unionists will want to anchor themselves in the UK.\n\nSolomon and Machiavelli might have passed up such a job as impossible, but O\u2019Neill has professed optimism and keenness to \u201cwork together with all parties to deliver on the needs and aspirations of workers, families and businesses\u201d.\n\nSexist jibes will not help.

Bright lipstick. Curled eyelashes. Painted nails. Figure-hugging outfits. Michelle O\u2019Neill certainly isn\u2019t what we expected.\u201d\n\nWhen Arlene Foster was a DUP first minister, she was pressed in an interview to sum up her Sinn F\u00e9in colleague in a word. \u201cBlonde,\u201d she replied.\n\nIf wounded, O\u2019Neill did not show it. Her public persona is of an open, affable, down-to-earth politician who gets on with her work. Officials at Stormont say she is the same when cameras are not rolling. \u201cNo airs, easy to get on with,\u201d said one.\n\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s background did not hint at a future hobnobbing in Washington, London and Brussels. She was born Michelle Doris into a working-class family in Clonoe, a village in County Tyrone. Her father, Brendan Doris, was an IRA prisoner and an uncle, Paul Doris, raised funds for the group.

At home she collapsed and sobbed. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that experience and I thought, \u2018Nobody will ever treat me like this again,\u2019\u201d she told the Irish Times in 2021.\n\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s family helped care for her baby daughter while she completed her A-levels and trained as a welfare rights adviser. In 2005 she won a seat on Dungannon borough council that had previously been held by her father and went on to become a protege of Francie Molloy, a Sinn F\u00e9in assembly member, and Martin McGuinness, the party\u2019s dominant figure alongside Gerry Adams.\n\nAfter she was elected to Stormont in 2007, the party hopscotched her over more senior colleagues by appointing her agriculture minister in 2011, health minister in 2015 and deputy first minister in 2017 after McGuinness\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cInitially she was seen as a puppet for Adams and the boys,\u201d said Shane Ross, a former Irish government minister and author of a biography of McDonald, using a euphemism for IRA veterans suspected of behind-the-scenes influence. \u201cBut she has grown in stature. Her authority is growing. She\u2019s certainly able enough.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill, now a grandmother, has reached out to unionists by attending King Charles\u2019s coronation and occasionally referring to \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d rather than the \u201cnorth of Ireland\u201d. She has also accepted Police Service of Northern Ireland protection, a break with the Sinn F\u00e9in tradition of using republican bodyguards.\n\nBut she defends the IRA\u2019s armed campaign up to the 1998 Good Friday agreement, saying there was \u201cno alternative\u201d, and attends memorials for former members, including a large funeral in 2020 during Covid restrictions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hypocritical to go and shake hands with various dignitaries but not condemn the killing of innocent people who were just doing an honest day\u2019s work,\u201d said Roy Crawford, an Ulster Unionist councillor for Fermanagh and Omagh district council. An IRA bomb killed his father, Ivan Crawford, a part-time Royal Ulster Constabulary officer, in 1987. \u201cJustice has not been got. The killers are running free,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m only one of many.\u201d\n\nStill, the unionist expressed hope about Stormont\u2019s restoration. \u201cWe are entering a new phase of history. We don\u2019t know what the future holds for us. We hope it\u2019s something tangible and positive.\u201d"}

A 100% humidity 100% of the time summer. Our forearms stuck to the textbooks, the round table, the mimeographed worksheets. We each brought a washcloth from home to wipe away our sweat.\n\nMr Martin was one of the nicest teachers around. During the school year he taught civics and history, but the principal had him teach algebra all summer long. Mr Martin made a dot on the green board and labelled it A. Then he erased the dot and the A and told us it was still there.\n\nOur textbooks took pity on us and wilted a little. There was one fan in the room \u2013 the kind that didn\u2019t oscillate. We took turns orbiting it with our washcloths.\n\nMostly, white kids went to other schools. I was in the 10% who didn\u2019t go to private schools, or Catholic schools, or the one public school for supersmart kids who took an IQ test in order to get in. I wondered if those kids ever went to summer school, and, if they did, were their summer-school rooms full of air-conditioned air.\n\nI didn\u2019t understand what humidity really was until years later when I left New Orleans. Other towns were hot during the summer, but their summers didn\u2019t swell into other months and their air didn\u2019t swell so thick that each breath felt like you were trying to inhale a couch cushion.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that algebra comes from zero. That\u2019s what my summer-school teacher told me. Mr Martin drew a zero in the middle of the board. Then he added a long line on both sides and asked me to come up and draw a car at ground zero. I drew a circle with four little zero wheels. I drew windows and doors and labelled it VW. Mr Martin had a story about the car driving west into the negative numbers of Texas and east into the positive numbers of Mississippi, all to show me why multiplying two negative numbers creates a positive answer. I was lost on the highway, but no one could tell.\n\nEverything is easier to set aside when it\u2019s smaller, close to zero, where the possibilities are endless and sometimes mysterious.\n\nThat summer-school summer, my mother set me to the side for five or six weeks \u2013 me on my own in our fourplex apartment with algebra homework, my 18-year-old brother out of the house, my little sister off with our father. My mother and her boyfriend were travelling out west, camping somewhere, across half the country. I knew the probability of her calling me from a camp ground was mathematically insignificant.\n\nI carried her suitcase to her silver Honda Z. The tiny car had two cylinders and two doors and was the kind of car four men could pick up, the kind that ranked first in gas mileage during the 1973 Opec oil crisis. I put her suitcase next to his suitcase. Their tent, two sleeping bags, their snacks and maps and binoculars and cameras were all collapsed together in the back seat, all part of her summer disappearing act.\n\nShe rolled her eyes. \u2018Teenagers love being on their own. You\u2019ll see.\u2019 Then she smiled. \u2018You won\u2019t even want me to come back\u2019\n\nI remember asking my mother not to go on her trip. We stood in the living room on the green shag rug. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cTeenagers love being on their own \u2026 you\u2019ll see.\u201d Then she smiled. \u201cYou won\u2019t even want me to come back.\u201d I stared at her suitcase and nodded.\n\nMy mother didn\u2019t know that I wrote my name and my favourite number eight in black Magic Marker on the bottom of her shoes before she took off. She couldn\u2019t see my name on the black soles, but it was there, touching the ground with her, wherever she was, around, somewhere. I may not have had a number to reach her, but I was sure she could feel me.\n\nThe silver flash of car, her hand leaning out of the driver\u2019s window, her moonstone ring catching the light as she waved goodbye.\n\nFirst, I tried naming the knives in the kitchen after the kids I babysat for: Cathy, Bill, Todd, Maggie. But still they looked dangerous \u2013 ready to defect with the first intruder who broke through the little lock on the apartment\u2019s front door. Even if they remained loyal, one slip through tomato pulp to the thumb bone and who will fix this all-alone mess? Who will drive this mess to the hospital?\n\nNot having an insurance card equals having no insurance. Hospitals require someone who can sign for things. So, I hid the knives \u2013 boys under the stove, girls in the freezer.\n\nThe lock on the front door of the apartment was the simple kind, the twist button in the middle of the doorknob kind. The kind you can open with a butter knife in the keyhole or a school ID card pressed between the lock and the door. The back door had the serious kind of lock, the dead-bolt kind. I was a fan of that dead bolt.\n\nI\u2019d seen Mary Tyler Moore\u2019s character Laura Petrie improvise a makeshift alarm system on the Dick Van Dyke Show. She was a mother in her 30s and still she was scared when home alone for one night. So, she piled pots and pans in front of the door. That way, if someone broke the lock and opened the door she would hear the crash and be able to get a head start. She was babysitting the neighbour\u2019s pet parrot and the parrot kept saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be scared. Don\u2019t be scared.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Smith photographed near her home in North Carolina last December. Photograph: Christopher Fowler/The Guardian\n\nI was groomed for the task of Don\u2019t Be Scared. I learned Don\u2019t Be Scared the way free divers learn Don\u2019t Breathe In as they swim headfirst into the blue-black sea with only a wet suit and a face mask. No tank of air is strapped to their backs. No nothing but the air they carry inside.\n\nYou sink or swim in this world. That\u2019s what my mother told me again and again.\n\nSometimes that summer, I went into my mother\u2019s closet and looked around at her clothes still there. Sometimes I wore one of her brand-new shirts because I liked new clothes, and she wasn\u2019t home. I liked to turn all the way around in the closet and let my cheek brush against the crowd of rayon, silk and cotton shoulders. I didn\u2019t go in looking for it, but I knew somewhere in between all the shoulders hung my worry: will she come back?\n\nThere was some money in the envelope my mother left in the kitchen drawer for groceries and the occasional cheeseburger. It was 10pm on a Thursday night and I could go anywhere. There was a chance the K&B drugstore on Saint Charles Avenue and Broadway would still be making cheeseburgers.\n\nI hadn\u2019t done much of anything the day before, the Fourth of July, except babysit for Maggie. Summer school had closed for the holiday, and Mr Martin and the other summer-school students and Maggie\u2019s family and my mother and her boyfriend and everyone had been somewhere looking at fireworks, spread out on blankets, with dogs and kids running around, music playing. A mile walk to the K&B on the day after the Fourth for a cheeseburger and cola seemed like a small thing I could do.\n\nSaint Charles Avenue was the most famous avenue in all of New Orleans, with streetcars travelling back and forth on the grassy neutral ground, and where rich people you never saw showed off houses that looked like sugar. I felt I was safe on Saint Charles, even if the sidewalks were dark with tree shadows.\n\nThere was the man outside his truck. I saw the knife in his hand. I froze\n\nBut a forest-green pickup truck circled around several times \u2013 into the neutral ground, across the streetcar tracks and back around to pass me on the sidewalk again \u2013 his red hair, red neck, him looking at me.\n\nI crossed the avenue once or twice to lose him the way I\u2019d lost other men on other days. I thought it had worked until there was the man outside his truck, standing on the dark sidewalk not far from me. He asked me for directions to the fireworks at Lake Pontchartrain since he was from out of town. It was 5 July, and the fireworks were over, and I didn\u2019t know the directions anyway. I turned to walk away, and he grabbed my arm. I was one block away from the K&B on the corner.\n\nI saw the knife in his hand down by his side. I froze the way an animal might freeze right before being killed. He said: \u201cIf you move or scream you are a fucking dead duck.\u201d\n\nThe way fuck and duck rhymed. He pulled me closer to the knife aimed at my guts. The way my guts made a fist.\n\nThe world split open and wobbled. The way I was sure someone driving by could see this and stop this. The way no one could see this knife by his side. He promised he\u2019d kill me if I made any sound as we walked arm in arm to the narrow sidestreet and his truck parked in the dark.\n\nThe way I should have jumped out of his truck while he was driving away. But who would help me after I jumped? He\u2019d get to me first and kill me right then. The way I wanted to Not Die and felt like I was dying.\n\nThe way I calculated how many days from Thursday it would take before someone would miss me. Maybe by the middle of next week, after enough summer-school absences, five days away. But no one would be home to get a call from the school office.\n\nHe wanted to drive to the lake or maybe across it to Mississippi. What were the chances he would bring me back here? He said he hadn\u2019t decided if he\u2019d kill me or not. The way I bargained and he unzipped his pants and made me touch his pink dick. The way I persuaded him to stay uptown and rape me in the park. That way, if I got away, I was still close to home. That way, if I didn\u2019t and he dumped me dead in the lagoon, someone I knew might ID me the next day. Then when my mother came back, she\u2019d know I hadn\u2019t just run away. And I, as a dead girl, wouldn\u2019t feel so all alone in the endless dark sky.\n\nThe way I heard someone walk by as I took off my clothes inside the dark truck. Who walks in this park so late at night? Who would believe this was a rape taking place? The way this rape could get worse if I shouted right now. I turned very small. He still had a knife, and the footsteps went away, and my silence stayed with me, and he thanked me right then for being on his side.\n\nThe way my arms kept pushing him away without thinking. The way I cried, and he said: \u201cDo I have to tie you up?\u201d The way I said: \u201cNo.\u201d He took over my body while I waited on the moon. The way I floated for hours on the dark side of pain. You sink or swim in this world. The way I sank. The way I swam.\n\n\u201cYou were no virgin,\u201d he said after. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you are just 14 years old.\u201d I nodded, because that\u2019s what you do when you\u2019ve been raped by someone who still might drive off to Mississippi with you in their truck. Someone who still hasn\u2019t decided if he\u2019s going to kill you or not. Someone who needs to believe that this was no rape, that you are not 14, that there\u2019s no way you\u2019re a virgin.\n\nWe drove around the park while he pretended we\u2019d been out on a date. I nodded, because that\u2019s what you do when a date with a rapist is better than a trip to Mississippi with one. The way I thanked him for the date.\n\nHe kept driving around the park and uptown and past Tulane and Loyola and back to the park, pretending and deciding.\n\nTell me if you\u2019re going to call the cops so I can be ready, you know, to get out of town sooner.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t. Why would I? The way the policemen would want to reach my unreachable mother.\n\nThe way he let me open the truck\u2019s door at the next corner and go. He asked for my name, and I gave him someone else\u2019s. The way I ran a kind of limping, hobbled run the six blocks home.\n\nI left my shoes and underwear on the floor of his truck. Two men on the sidewalk shouted something at me. The way I hated them. I looked back to see if they were chasing me, if the truck was circling around for me. The way pain shot through me as I ran, and blood dripped down my legs and soaked the crotch of my pants. The way I bled for three days.\n\nThat Thursday night, for the first time, I piled three silver pots and some glass ashtrays in front of the door, like Laura Petrie did on the Dick Van Dyke Show. I began my practice of laying my head where my feet used to go, so I could see through the living room to the big front door with the too-little lock and my homemade alarm. That way I could sleep until it came crashing down.\n\nThere\u2019s a tiny speck at the corner of the eyelid near the bridge of the nose and it\u2019s called a punctum. When I was in grade school, I held an onion near my face while I looked in the mirror and pulled down my eyelid. I waited for my tiny speck to produce a stream of onion tears. Turns out that tears do not come from this miniature orifice. Instead, the punctum is a drain for tears that naturally fill our eyes all through the day. When we cry, the small drain becomes overwhelmed. Our eyes are not suited for a flood of sad feelings.\n\nI forgot to bring my washcloth. I forgot to bring my book. I sat in the school library surrounded by numbers and books and felt the feeling of nothing, like the space inside zero that holds everything together. I put my head on the wooden table and listened to Mr Martin go on about numbers. He drew a large oval on the green board and in it he wrote rational numbers. Then he drew another oval next to the rational one and wrote irrational numbers. I didn\u2019t think about numbers. I thought about the ovals Mrs Harrigan had drawn on the green board during health class last year. Inside the space of the ovals she\u2019d written the word impregnated. Then she lectured us on the importance of guarding our eggs at all costs.\n\nView image in fullscreen Smith aged 18.\n\nPlease let me be not impregnated. I prayed to all the infinite numbers in the universe. I prayed to the moon, to the top of the trees and the lagoon in the park and to the school that I sat in full of summer-school teachers. I covered every space I could see with my one single prayer. Please let me be not impregnated.\n\nI stayed after class and helped Mr Martin sort through his papers. Wouldn\u2019t he see the things my face had to say? Then maybe he\u2019d bring me to his house where I would babysit his son and help out his wife. She might comb my hair and make me a sandwich and let me sleep on their couch where it would feel so much safer. They would hear my telling and keep my secrets. And I\u2019d go back home in August when my mother returned.\n\nI hinted. I talked about the recent case of a teacher in another school who had been raped in the parking lot by a man she carpooled with.\n\n\u201cThat kind of happened to me,\u201d I said. \u201cLast night.\u201d\n\nI held my breath like a diver.\n\nMr Martin didn\u2019t look up from his papers. He reached for his briefcase and put his notebooks inside.\n\n\u201cMen can\u2019t understand rape,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen I got home from school, I put the Thursday clothes in a paper bag and took them to the trash can in the parking lot behind the apartment building. They\u2019d have to wait there until the trash was picked up on Monday. But when I got back upstairs, I could still hear them crying. After an hour, I brought the clothes inside.\n\nI washed them by hand and then hid them under a box at the back of my closet. It was the best I could do. They quieted down or else they just died.\n\nAt night, my ears were two bloodhounds without a leash following every sound. There was a faint clicking that took me a week to locate. I\u2019d looked everywhere for its source. I even timed the intervals between the clicks \u2013 20 seconds, six seconds, 12 seconds. The pattern repeated, but I couldn\u2019t break the code. Then one morning as I waited on the corner for the light to change, a clunking sound hung above me and I looked up: 20 seconds of green, six seconds of yellow and 12 seconds of red.\n\nI brought the Random House dictionary into my room. I wondered if other people picked words at random from dictionaries and books to help them find answers they couldn\u2019t find elsewhere.\n\nI let the pages of the large dictionary flip-flop back and forth between my palms. I wanted a word just for me in that moment.\n\nThe pages fell open in the As. I closed my eyes and let my finger land on a word.\n\nag\u00b7gra\u00b7vat\u00b7ed\n\nadjective\n\nan offence made worse, as in the use of a deadly weapon [kid-napping, rape]\n\nI couldn\u2019t let that word stay in my room overnight. Some words that show up are not talismans at all. Instead, they push their way forward like a bad dream with a fever.\n\nI was sitting in algebra class when the blood came. Mr Martin was in the middle of reading a quote about algebra being metaphysical. The VW zero we\u2019d drawn was still in the middle of the east-west highway behind him. I asked Mr Martin for a pass to the girl\u2019s restroom.\n\nDear Our Lady of the Blessed Menstruation, thank God I\u2019m not pregnant.\n\nMr Martin had no idea what a horror the girls\u2019 restroom was \u2013 how not a single toilet worked, ever. How the toilets were chronically stopped up with bloody Kotex and shit. How, during the regular school year, the girls\u2019 bathroom was just a place to buy dope, write graffiti, smoke, fight or fuck. I felt like I might vomit.\n\nDuring summer school the bathroom was mostly empty. I jammed my washcloth into my underpants and headed home. For each block on the long sweaty walk, I counted how many humid breaths I inhaled and exhaled. Counting this way kept me from fainting.\n\nThe cramps were furious \u2013 as though my uterus was slicing its own lining to shreds first before spitting it out. As though the lining were the underpants I left in the truck on Thursday 5 July. As though my pelvis was finally able to scream and kick and punch the closest thing it could find.\n\nIt never occurred to me that it should have occurred to my mother to do more to protect me. What you get is what you get.\n\nMy mother wasn\u2019t the kind of person to need other people. That\u2019s what she told me once when I was alone in Ireland at 18 years old. I was ready to come back after three months on an independent study project for college. I didn\u2019t use the word lonely, but my mother could sniff out my soft sides like a German shepherd sniffs out a bomb. I only ever told her I missed her one time after I\u2019d moved out. She howled in complaint. \u201cHow can you miss me? You keep coming back.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Smith with a photograph of her mother. Photograph: Christopher Fowler/The Guardian\n\nAfter I graduated from college, I moved to New York City. So Big and So Fast. I uprooted my fear and never moved back to my home below sea level.\n\nI worked with heroin addicts in a methadone clinic on Third Avenue in Brooklyn. The clinic was in a squat brick building that sat under the elevated expressway alongside cheque-cashing joints and scrap-metal shops. It was 1980 and everything was grimy. The clinic had no windows, just bricked-in square sockets missing their square eyes. Inside the front door sat a uniformed officer with a gun on his hip. But I liked working there.\n\nThe clients served as an antidote for my own predilections. Their trauma flooded through the clinic and kept my own trauma at bay. The first client I met in the clinic was Louis, a young guy my own age who tried hard to get clean. He dressed sharp every day and smelled of cologne. A Bengal tiger tattoo crouched at the crook of his arm, covering his troubled cradle of veins.\n\nMore than a third of adolescents who are abused or neglected will have a substance abuse disorder before they turn 18 years old. I took it hard when Louis disappeared. I took it hard when I learned that he had relapsed and was dying at home alone from a disease we\u2019d soon learn to call Aids.\n\nThe Guardian Angels had just begun patrolling the subways when I moved to New York City. They wore red berets and white T-shirts. The only weapons they carried were their martial arts skills and a cool logo bearing guardian wings. I decided to find a martial arts dojo in my Brooklyn neighbourhood and begin my own training in earnest. Most days after work, I headed over to the dojo eight blocks away.\n\nThe temple is a vulnerable spot on the body and I learned how to exploit it with a fast stab from an ink pen. I knew how to smash a nose with the heel of my hand and jab an eye with a finger turned bayonet. Everything can be made into a weapon somehow. The point is to shock the fucker and create enough space to just run away.\n\nOnly recently have we realised that rape is the longest-running war on the planet\n\nSeveral women in the dojo posted a manifesto in the dressing room and asked the other women to please sign the pledge: \u201cI promise that should anyone ever attack me and try to rape me, I will always fight back with everything that I have, even if it means a fight to my death.\u201d As though our martyrdom will be remembered and hailed in the future, our faces commemorated on postage stamps, and our sacrifice observed annually with large wreaths of white flowers. Because not fighting to the death marks you for life as some kind of traitor. I watched as students left the dressing room taller by a foot after making a promise to one another to never be me.\n\nWe\u2019ve always had ways to describe the suffering that continues after nearly losing your life. Soldier\u2019s heart was the term used to describe post-traumatic stress disorder among civil war veterans. Shell shock and battle fatigue were for veterans of fresher combat.\n\nOnly recently have we realised that rape is the longest-running war on the planet.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the exact day my mother came back home from her summer road trip. But I know it was after I passed summer-school algebra because I signed her name on my report card with big swirling loops the way she would have done. And I know it was after the Watergate hearings went off the air on 8 August because she missed the whole thing, and I no longer came home in the afternoon to watch it live on our tiny Sony TV. I don\u2019t remember having to rush around and clean up the apartment. I always kept the dishes washed, the rugs vacuumed, the plants happy and the bathroom clean.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the day my mother returned, because she left again the following summer for five or six weeks, and that\u2019s what sticks out. But I can imagine my mother\u2019s silver Honda Z pulling up to the kerb in front of our apartment with all her stuff in the back seat. And I imagine, if I was home, I helped carry all her things back up to our place.\n\nI don\u2019t remember, but I guess she had stories to share about the desert and the thousands of stars you can see in New Mexico when you\u2019re camping at night, and how she\u2019d still like to fly into outer space if she had a rocket. I imagine I helped my mom pack and unpack her silver Honda Z again the next summer.\n\nOne of the astronauts said that when they went to the moon, they were technicians, but when they returned to Earth, they were humanitarians. He was talking about the power of the big picture, the connections you can see from up and over, that view you get when you float in space like a dead man and look back at your home.\n\nMy mother went to New Mexico and then to Minnesota and around somewhere, but I was the one who got the long-distance view. And just like the men who walked on the moon, I tried to love the whole world and its magnificent desolation, even if it killed me.\n\nThis is an edited extract from Everywhere the Undrowned by Stephanie Clare Smith, published by the University of North Carolina Press at \u00a319.95.

He boarded a tube at Clapham South underground station and by 8pm he was at King\u2019s Cross tube station.\n\nAt 8.42pm, Ezedi was captured on CCTV in a branch of Tesco on Caledonian Road, pictured with a \u201cfairly significant facial injury\u201d, where he bought a bottle of water. He then boarded a southbound Victoria line tube train at 9pm, the last confirmed sighting.\n\nSavell said to Ezedi: \u201cAbdul, you clearly have got some very significant injuries. We\u2019ve seen the images. You need some medical help, so do the right thing and hand yourself in.\u201d\n\nEzedi, reportedly from Afghanistan, was convicted in 2018 for sexual assault and exposure and granted refugee status in 2021 or 2022. He was believed by British government officials to be an Afghan national who arrived in a lorry in 2016.\n\nHis brother, Hassan, told the Sun he would hand the suspect in if he knew where he was and urged him to give himself up. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s alive or where he is now. I saw him briefly last week. He wasn\u2019t living with me. He was in Newcastle,\u201d he told the paper.\n\nA number of Conservative MPs have since questioned how he was granted refugee status, despite two previous failed attempts and his criminal convictions. He is understood to have been allowed to stay in the UK after a priest confirmed he had converted to Christianity.\n\nThe Rt Rev Phillip North, the bishop of Blackburn, hit back against a suggestion by the former immigration minister Robert Jenrick that people making \u201cspurious asylum claims\u201d were being aided by \u201cwell-meaning but naive vicars and priests\u201d.\n\nNorth told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme on Friday: \u201cIn this diocese I\u2019ve done quite a few confirmations, maybe 30 or 40, mostly of Iranian men who are seeking asylum. Preparation for that has been done in great depth by parish clergy, who have got to know those people well.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t look into someone\u2019s soul, you can\u2019t see what is going on at the very depths of their heart. But you can see they have become integrated with the church, they are practising their faith and have gone through a confirmation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe church is not the asylum authority, responsibility for asylum lies with government and this sounds to me like a pretty barefaced attempt to outsource responsibility for a failing asylum system to the church.\u201d\n\nThe Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle said it had \u201cfound nothing\u201d to suggest Ezedi had become a Catholic but checks were continuing.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe can confirm that Abdul Shakoor Ezedi visited our diocesan Justice and Peace Refugee Project, a charitable venture which assists a wide range of people who come to us in need.\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of checking if this individual was received into the Catholic faith in any of our parishes, and have so far found nothing to support that. We are also investigating whether he was helped in other ways.\n\n\u201cThe diocese will assist the police investigations in any way we can.\u201d"}

The book follows a woman returning to her home town, who, while renting a room overlooking her mother\u2019s house, spends her time imagining the lodger who replaced her at her last temporary dwelling. When she arrives at the flat she has sublet, \u201ccompact and hot and, like a lot of short-term adult accommodation, kitted out by small acts of shopping for low-cost utensils\u201d, she is struck by its similarity to the packaging for the sandwich she has just eaten. \u201cThe triangular box was empty, with an inside that resembled, like sarcasm, the one I was in \u2026 It had a window too.\u201d\n\nPester, an academic and lecturer whose poetry collection Comic Timing also deals with the many petty indignities of precarious living, says she wanted to explore the \u201ceerie psychic state created by perpetual precarious housing ... the ways it changes your voice and self-expression\u201d. Throughout the novel, her protagonist traces the ways in which she has learned \u201cto lodge, I mean, adapt and hide my needs rather than dig down, simply hover without much substance, meekly occupy, as the tenant of the tenant\u201d.\n\nThe Lodgers is one of a number of forthcoming novels that deal explicitly with the UK\u2019s housing crisis, the ways in which it shapes and misshapes us. Also out in the next few months are Francesca Reece\u2019s Glass Houses, which explores the impact of gentrification and second homes in north Wales, and Ella Frears\u2019 Goodlord, which takes the form of an extended email to an unscrupulous estate agent. In Michael Magee\u2019s recent novel Close to Home, the housing crisis looms large, the characters always grasping for even the most basic sense of stability, while Guy Ware\u2019s The Peckham Experiment does a deft job of sketching out the broken ideologies that got us here in the first place. And these are just the most recent examples. To read many contemporary novels by young(ish) writers is to be struck time and again by the extent to which our relationship to property has become simultaneously both perverse and perverting.\n\nIt didn\u2019t always feel this way. When I think back to my late teens, the period of my life when I first started reading books, part of their appeal, along with the romantic desire to become a writer, was shaped by a naive sense that in the world of novels, people had houses, nice houses even; houses they weren\u2019t constantly afraid of losing, houses that didn\u2019t belong to someone else entirely. Aged 17, living in Shard End, an area of Birmingham where money was often extremely tight, the sprawling piles and country estates I was reading about in Evelyn Waugh seemed pretty appealing. And so did the glamorous glass cityscapes of Jay McInerney and Bret Easton Ellis. Even the garrets of Henry Miller and Virginia Woolf\u2019s famous A Room of One\u2019s Own exerted a deep pull on my teenage psyche, summoning visions of independence, freedom and possibility.\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: PR\n\nBack then, my ignorance knew few bounds. I wasn\u2019t aware that I was predominantly reading from something called the \u201ccanon\u201d, an inherently bourgeois realist tradition that was preoccupied with reproducing the concerns of its class: property, wealth, marriage, propriety. I wasn\u2019t aware that in today\u2019s money Woolf was suggesting all one needed to scrape by as a writer was a servant and a private income of \u00a375k a year. And I certainly wasn\u2019t aware that Britain had spent three decades getting itself into such a structural crisis when it came to housing that it would become arguably the defining economic headwind of not just my adult life, but that of almost everyone I knew. There have been times when it seemed as though it was the only conversation, a generation of Ancient Mariners forced to retell versions of the same story: rents spiralling, wages stagnating, landlords becoming increasingly shameless and exploitative as the dynamics of the market tilt ever more in their favour.\n\nThe protagonists in this wave of books are locked out of the future and waiting for life to begin\n\nThe effects of the crisis are maddening and wide ranging; material, psychological and, inevitably, artistic. Millions now experience the housing market as a type of perpetual Hunger Games, all while being told, explicitly or otherwise, that it can\u2019t be that bad. Let\u2019s be clear, it is that bad. Because this was never supposed to be the deal. Regardless of one\u2019s stance on capitalism, its basic proposal was always something like: give us your labour and time, and in exchange you get a stake in the system. Perhaps not a fair stake, but a stake nonetheless. But these days, even that meagre offer seems like a cruel joke.\n\nTalk to most people under 40, who have spent two decades watching the economy limp from crisis to crisis while asset holders and rentiers cash in on a system designed, maintained and calibrated for their benefit, and the picture is altogether different. For them, in the context of an increasingly fragile social safety net, widening inequality and a retirement that, rather than merely being impoverished will more than likely never happen at all, the question seems to ask itself: why exactly am I giving up most of my waking hours to work, all for the dubious pleasure of handing 75% of my meagre wage to a landlord who happens to own a flat or 10 in east London that they paid five quid for at some point in the mid 1980s?\n\nIf you have been an asset holder during this period, when it has been common for the average home to \u201cearn\u201d more than the average person, then it is difficult to imagine quite how brutal the rental market currently is. But for everyone else, the damage looms large. Is it any surprise, then, that as well as living through it and despairing about it in pubs, we are also writing about it? Because we\u2019re certainly doing that. In many contemporary novels, it is commonplace for protagonists to live lives characterised by scarcity and insecurity, where the notion of the home has become definitively divorced from any associations it might have historically had with stability, security, comfort or permanence. I\u2019m no different in this regard. In my latest novel, I See Buildings Fall Like Lightning, the symbolic centre of gravity is a newbuild estate, looming over the lives of the characters.\n\nRead enough books by this new generation of writers and the cumulative effect becomes overwhelming; the atmosphere is one of anxiety, a peripatetic type of extended adolescence, in which protagonists are locked out of the future and waiting for life to begin in earnest.\n\nIn Jessica Andrews\u2019 Milk Teeth, the novel\u2019s romantic claustrophobia is to a large extent driven by the protagonist\u2019s desire to escape the merry-go-round of grim box rooms. And there is a sense that even in novels where the issue of housing is not an explicit concern, it still hovers in the background as an ambient force, shaping and distorting. Take Susannah Dickey\u2019s Common Decency, on the surface a classic odd couple story, but also one in which the mentality of both main characters, who live in the same apartment building in Belfast, is revealed to be a result of the same deadening economic logic, driving us towards lives of isolation and individualism. In fact, if a character isn\u2019t legibly stressed about their living situation, then, as contemporary readers, we begin to wonder why. Are we reading about a secret aristocrat, or perhaps the ostensibly naturalistic novel in our hands is actually a piece of magic realism, set in a world that is broadly recognisable but in which Thatcher didn\u2019t sell off all the housing stock?\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Bookmarks Free weekly newsletter Discover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.

Are they a secret aristocrat?\n\nThere\u2019s often a class antagonism at play in these novels. Much of the mainstream political discourse around the housing crisis, driven by those least impacted by it, self-servingly occludes a basic moral assertion, which is that there is no such thing as a \u201cgood\u201d landlord any more than there is such a thing as a \u201cgood\u201d mugger. The fact that some muggers might be more polite than others doesn\u2019t make them good, it just makes them marginally preferable to the ones that decide to punch you in the face for good measure.\n\nThe idea that landlords are engaged in a fundamentally extractive and immoral practice never used to be a particularly controversial claim, and it certainly wasn\u2019t an idea held only by those on the nominal left. Whether it be Churchill, Adam Smith or David Ricardo, any number of conservative and free-market icons thought it common sense \u2013 if someone is hoarding an essential asset, especially in a time of scarcity, and using that excess to extract unearned profits, then they cannot, in any meaningful sense, be regarded as \u201cgood\u201d. Most people I know would agree with this, even those who consider themselves broadly apolitical, but if it were ever uttered by an MP or on prime time TV, it would be framed as an extreme and marginal point of view.\n\nIt is a depressingly relevant fact that the publishing industry also reproduces and exacerbates these inequities; underpaying and exploiting its workforce, writers included, and expecting those without independent means to pay their rent using the dubious currencies of gratitude, enthusiasm and social cache. Increasingly consolidated, large publishing houses will more often than not allocate disproportionate financial resources to a handful of writers, while the vast majority are left to fight over the crumbs. With average earnings for an author falling to just \u00a37,000 a year, and junior salaries within publishing houses prohibitively low, all while shareholders celebrate record-breaking profits, it is hard not to get the sense that something has to give.\n\nThere are formal implications too. A couple of years ago, Joyce Carol Oates riled up literary Twitter when she referred to the wave of contemporary autofiction as consisting of \u201cwan little husks\u201d. There have been many insightful essays written on that particular issue, but I have often wondered if there might also be something more basic going on. Almost all novelists now have day jobs to pay the rent, snatching time to write here and there on commutes and in the stolen hours before or after work. If they manage to actually find enough time to finish writing a novel, they then submit it to an overstretched and under-remunerated editor who will have to read it at the weekend. Is it entirely wild to suggest that such a state of affairs might yield shorter books, more fragmentary books, books that are more inclined to reproduce rather than transform the immediate context of their production?\n\nThis is not a case of special pleading. Rather, it is an attempt to demonstrate that when one of life\u2019s basic necessities is co-opted in the service of generating outsized profits for the few, the impact will be felt everywhere. Shareholders and celebrity memoirists aside, it is to the benefit of nobody that we perpetuate an economic system in which writing and publishing become (even more so) the preserve of affluent hobbyists or beleaguered and exhausted obsessives.\n\nIn the present moment, novels like The Lodgers are vital, capturing the humiliations and psychospiritual damage being wrought by the current state of things. As Pester\u2019s protagonist puts it, \u201cWhy not once and for all just climb inside the sandwich box?\u201d But over the longer term, mass artistic representation of a failing system should serve as a stark warning. We can and must write about the conditions under which we live. But we must also fight for an economic settlement in which the basic dignities of life, including access to secure and affordable housing, are provided as a matter of course, rather than remaining, as they do for so many, merely the stuff of fiction."}

The Euphrates River cuts through Syria into Iraq, with U.S. troops and American-backed Kurdish-led fighters on the east bank and Iran-backed fighters and Syrian government forces to the west.Bases for U.S. troops in Iraq have come under attack too.\n\nIran-backed militias control the Iraqi side of the border and move freely in and out of Syria, where they man posts with their allies from Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah and other Shiite armed groups.\n\nWhich targets were hit and how many people were killed?\n\nThe U.S. military said Friday that its massive barrage of strikes hit command and control headquarters; intelligence centers; rockets and missiles, drone and ammunition storage sites; and other facilities connected to the militias and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, which handles Tehran's relationship with, and arming of, regional militias.\n\nSyrian opposition activists said the strikes hit the Imam Ali base near the border Syrian town of Boukamal, the Ein Ali base in Quriya, just south of the strategic town of Mayadeen, and a radar center on a mountain near the provincial capital that is also called Deir el-Zour.\n\nRami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said 29 rank-and-file fighters were killed in those strikes.\n\nThe attacks also hit a border crossing known as Humaydiya, where militia cross back and forth between Iraq and Syria, according to Omar Abu Layla, a Europe-based activist who heads the Deir Ezzor 24 media outlet. He said the strikes also hit an area inside the town of Mayadeen known as \"the security quarter.\"\n\nIraqi government spokesperson Bassim al-Awadi said the border strikes killed 16 people and caused \"significant damage\" to homes and private properties.\n\nThe Popular Mobilization Force, a coalition of Iran-backed militia that is nominally under the control of the Iraqi military, said the strikes in western Iraq hit a logistical support post, a tanks battalion, an artillery post and a hospital. The PMF said 16 people were killed and 36 wounded, and that authorities were searching for other missing people.\n\nHow will Iran-backed fighters retaliate?\n\nIran and groups it backs in the region aim to put pressure on Washington to force Israel to end its crushing offensive in Gaza, but do not appear to want all-out war. The defeat of Hamas would be a major setback for Tehran, which considers itself and its allies the main defenders of the Palestinian cause.\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group for Iran-backed groups, said it carried out two explosive drone attacks Saturday on bases housing U.S. troops in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil and a post in northeast Syria near the Iraqi border.\n\nThe only Iran-backed faction that has been escalating are Yemen's Houthi rebels, which have targeted commercial ships and U.S. warships in the Red Sea with drones and ballistic missiles. The U.S. has carried out strikes against Houthis in Yemen over the past two weeks. There have been no new attacks by the Houthis since the U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria."}

The \"life-threatening flooding\" risk extended across the entire region, forecasters said.\n\nRainfall will ramp up Sunday, particularly in Southern California from Santa Barbara southward, which could bring flash floods, power outages and landslides. In the Los Angeles area, there could be 3-6 inches of rain along the coast and in the valleys, and between 6 and 12 inches in the foothills and mountains, NWS said.\n\nAlready, emergency management offices in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties were issuing evacuation warnings and sandbag pickups to brace for floods.\n\nThe NWS has predicted the latest \u201cPineapple Express\u201d storm \u2014 an atmospheric river arriving along the state\u2019s Central Coast \u2014 will become the season\u2019s largest.

Latest 'Pineapple Express' forecast is dangerous.\n\nIn the heavily populated San Fernando Valley and LA Basin, NWS said streams and small rivers will rise quickly and turn into \u201cvery dangerous raging rivers.\" That includes the Los Angeles River, which is mostly encased in concrete as a century-old measure to reduce flood risk.\n\nMeanwhile, Santa Barbara's evacuation warning covered a vast swath of the city. Other evacuation warnings included several burn areas, including one where a 2018 mudflow, brought by heavy rain, killed nearly two dozen people and injured hundreds. People with disabilities and those with large animals should leave now, Santa Barbara's warning said.\n\nThe state is also expected to see periodic strong, gusty winds that likely lead to property and tree damage, as well as power outages. Mountains are also expected to see heavy snowfall across the entire state at elevations as low as 2,500 feet in Northern California, and upwards of 5,000 feet in Southern California. Multiple feet of snow are likely to collect across several mountain ranges, causing extremely difficult travel in these areas.\n\nGov. Newsom announced the state has over 8,000 personnel mobilized for the storms. So far, this includes state firefighters and water and urban search and rescue in 19 counties, along with National Guard, transportation staff, highway patrol and state conservation corps."}

She finished nearly 32 seconds ahead of runner-up Emily Sisson, effectively pulverizing a deep and talented field of American distance runners and booking her ticket to the 2024 Paris Olympics this summer.\n\nShe also became the first woman to win the U.S. Olympic marathon trials in her first race at the distance.\n\n\"The past couple years, I've been kind of clawing my way through things,\" O'Keeffe told NBC after her win. \"I was not expecting this performance. I had to pinch myself with eight miles to go and say 'stay calm, don't freak out.'\"\n\nSisson, who entered Saturday's race as one of the favorites, joined O'Keeffe in qualifying for the Paris Games on Saturday, as did little-known Dakotah Lindwurm, who started out as a walk-on athlete at her DIvision II school in South Dakota.\n\nOn the men's side, training partners and former BYU teammates Conner Mantz and Clayton Young secured the two guaranteed U.S. spots in Paris. While they ran shoulder-to-shoulder down the home stretch, it was Mantz who crossed the finish line first in a time of 2:09:05, with Young just one second behind him.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympic start July 26, with the men's and women's marathons slated for Aug. 10 and Aug. 11, respectively.\n\nWho is Fiona O'Keeffe?\n\nO'Keeffe, 25, didn't arrive in Orlando on Saturday as one of the favorites, but she wasn't a complete unknown either.\n\nO'Keeffe grew up in Davis, California and won the 5,000-meter race at the 2016 U.S. junior nationals. She was a six-time all-American at Stanford before turning pro in 2021, and she's been in the mix on the track at various points during her brief pro career. O'Keeffe finished sixth in the 5,000 meters at the 2022 outdoor track and field national championships.\n\nAfter missing part of last year with an ankle injury, O'Keeffe set her sights on the marathon \u2212 and perhaps a shot at qualifying for the Paris Olympics.\n\nFor the first half of Saturday's race, she was at or near the front of a 10-woman lead pack, looking comfortable alongside some of the more recognizable faces in the race, Keira D'Amato and Sara Hall. Then, at Mile 19, O'Keeffe started turning the proverbial screws, putting a little bit of distance between herself and the rest of the field.\n\nBy Mile 24, she had opened up a whopping 40-second lead over Sisson, effectively putting the race away with two-plus miles to go and the temperature in Orlando creeping closer to 70 degrees.\n\n\"I just tried to stay focused on the running, go back to the feeling of workouts that I've done,\" O'Keeffe said.\n\nHer performance drew immediate praise from NBC analyst and former marathoner Kara Goucher, who said on the television broadcast: \"The future has arrived.\"\n\nBYU teammates go 1-2 in men's race\n\nNearly three quarters of the way through the men's race Mantz and Young exchanged a quick high five as they passed a water station. It was a sign of agreement that it was time to lock down their Olympic spots.\n\nMantz and Young entered Saturday's race as the only two men who had met the Olympic standard, so it wasn't entirely surprising to see the former BYU teammates cross the finish line well ahead of the rest of the field.\n\nA hard-charging Leonard Korir finished third in 2:09:57 but will have to wait and see if he is able to compete at the 2024 Games; The U.S. only has two guaranteed spots in the men's race but could add a third in the coming months if an American man besides Mantz or Young finishes a major marathon in 2:08:10 or faster.\n\nMantz, 27, and Young, 30, both competed collegiately at BYU and have emerged in recent years as Team USA's top contenders in the marathon, an event in which the U.S. men have won just two Olympic medals since 1980. Mantz entered Saturday with the fastest personal best of anyone in the field, a 2:07:47 in a sixth-place finish at the Chicago Marathon last fall. Young finished seventh in that race with a time of 2:08.\n\nMantz told NBC that he considers Young to be both a mentor and close friend.\n\n\"We train together, we worked out together, we run together almost every day,\" he said on the television broadcast after his win.\n\n\"The last two miles, I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to finish. But Clayton just kept saying 'hey, just run behind me, we've got this, just stay together.' It meant a lot (and allowed me) to say, 'OK, I can run with Clayton.' \"\n\nWhile Mantz and Young were always near the front of the pack, it was Grand Valley State product Zach Panning, who led for roughly 17 of the 26.2 miles and set the pace for the majority of the race. He finished sixth.\n\nTough day for some big names in Olympic marathon trials\n\nGalen Rupp, who won the 2020 Olympic marathon trials and placed eighth in Tokyo, started strong but fell off the lead pack around Mile 17. He ultimately came in 16th and will miss out on the chance to win a second Olympic marathon medal; He took bronze in 2016.\n\nAbdi Abdirahman, a five-time Olympian who is 47 years old, and 2021 Olympian Jake Riley were among the notable names who did not finish the men's race, while 2021 Olympic qualifier Aliphine Tuliamuk was among those who recorded a DNF on the women's side.\n\nMolly Seidel, who was the only American to win a marthon medal at the Tokyo Games, had been scheduled to compete Saturday but announced 48 hours beforehand that she was withdrawing because of a knee injury.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad."}

Episodes 1-3 are in theaters now, replaced by Episodes 4-6 beginning Feb. 16 and the season's final two episodes starting Feb. 29.\n\nAfter experimenting with past \"Chosen\" releases, Season 4 called for an entire theatrical release, according to creator, director and co-screenwriter Dallas Jenkins.\n\n\"This season we've got significant biblical events happening like the death of John the Baptist and the raising of Lazarus from the dead,\" says Jenkins. \"These moments are better watching with a crowd and on the big screen.\"\n\nImportantly, faithful \"Chosen\" fans have already shown they're willing to pay admission to be in the early congregation for the series, which is traditionally released free on \"The Chosen\" app before moving to streaming platforms like Amazon Prime and Netflix.\n\nPrevious theatrical runs for two Christmas specials and Season 3 episodes claimed an impressive $40 million at the box office, says Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events, which hosts the national screenings. The new episodes are booked in 2,300 theaters during the traditionally forgettable February movie months.\n\n\"With 'The Chosen,' people have already shown they want to see it shoulder-to-shoulder, crying and laughing together,\" says Nutt. \"We think this is going to be big.\"\n\nWhen is 'The Chosen' Season 4 streaming?\n\nJenkins has not bypassed the traditionally free \"Chosen\" release, and is eyeballing a streaming date before June, not long after the theatrical run ends in March. \"We don't want to make people wait much longer,\" he says.\n\nWhat happens in 'The Chosen' Season 4?\n\nThere are not many details in the well-known Bible story depicting Salome's dance in front of her stepfather King Herod, known as the Dance of the Seven Veils, which led to the death of the imprisoned John the Baptist.\n\n\"The Bible just says that Salome, daughter of Herodias, danced, and Herod was very pleased, offering half his kingdom. But Salome asked for the head of John the Baptist,\" says Jenkins. \"But to just rush through showing the dance, I don't think would have honored this story.\"\n\nIn typical \"Chosen\" style, the season premiere explores plausible scenarios around the dance preparation that were never mentioned in the Bible. The rehearsals not only show Roman-era dance work, but reveal Herodias' plan for revenge against Jesus' contemporary John, who had publicly condemned her marriage to Herod.\n\nIn the background, Herodias pushes for dance perfection from Salome, played by Briar Nolet, a one-time competitor on NBC's \"World of Dance.\"\n\n\"We had to hire an actor who could really dance, (with) no body doubles,\" says Jenkins, stressing its importance in telling a larger story. \"We like seeing the dance mechanics, how hard it is for Salome to get right, and how important that is to Herodias, who is obsessed with a perfect dance. It shows how high the stakes are. That makes for good television.\"\n\nThe grand party, shot on \"The Chosen\" set in Goshen, Utah, features fire breathers, snake dancers and revelers. But the showstopper is Salome's dance before Herod, choreographed by Daniel Lim with regional and time-specific dance styles.\n\n\"It's one of the biggest and most expansive scenes we've ever shot,\" says Jenkins. \"And one of the most beautiful.\"\n\nWho dies in 'The Chosen' Season 4? (Spoiler ahead!)\n\nThere are emotional deaths in the new \"The Chosen\" season, including John the Baptist as a result of Salome's dance.\n\nIn terms of surprise power, however, it's hard to beat the shocking Episode 3 demise of fan-favorite Ramah (Yasmine Al-Bustami). Jenkins says the fictional but \"plausible\" character was always intended to face a tragic end after an endearing role that showed her relationship and even chaste romance while following Jesus.\n\nAfter becoming engaged to Jesus' disciple Thomas in Episode 1, the couple seems destined for long-term happiness. But Ramah accidentally ends up on the wrong end of the sword belonging to Roman magistrate Quintus (Brandon Potter), who loses his head during a tense crowd scene. It's a blow.\n\n\"We've always known this was coming,\" says Jenkins. \"But it's going to be very painful for fans. There's going to be people upset and confused why we even chose this path if we didn't have to.\"\n\nBut there's a \"long game\" for Ramah's character. Jenkins says the tragic death helps the series illustrate how disciple Thomas (Joey Vahedi) becomes the \"Doubting Thomas\" of the Bible, who demands to see proof of Jesus' crucifixion wounds before believing his resurrection from the dead.\n\n\"Ramah had always been this positive force, always encouraging Thomas to not be doubtful, to take a leap of faith,\" says Al-Bustami. \"He's going to continue, but without her influence. That's going to have an impact. It hurts, but it's a beautiful story.\""}

Dean Phillips, D-Minn., and Marianne Williamson.\n\nThough the outcome isn\u2019t in question, the primary could give clues as to where Biden stands with his party\u2019s base. How well he energizes Black voters in South Carolina could forecast how he might fare elsewhere and what more he has to do to win over key supporters to secure a second term.\n\nAnd the South Carolina primary is just another piece in the puzzle of the 2024 general election being a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nFollow along throughout the day for live coverage from USA TODAY's team of journalists.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWhen is the primary in South Carolina?A guide to the Republican and Democratic elections.\n\nWhy is South Carolina going first?\n\nSouth Carolina is the first of many primaries in what is expected to be a brutal presidential rematch this November against former President Donald Trump, a Republican.\n\nSouth Carolina doesn\u2019t usually go first. That honor of first-in-the-nation primary has traditionally been bestowed upon New Hampshire.\n\nBut national Democrats decided to move up South Carolina\u2019s primary this year and make it the nation\u2019s first official contest. Part of the reason is South Carolina has a diverse population. Black people make up nearly 30% of the state\u2019s population while New Hampshire is nearly 93% white.\n\nNew Hampshire, however, objected to changing the primary calendar and scheduled its contest earlier than allowed. National Democrats said that violated the rules, so Biden didn\u2019t appear on the ballot there. Not that it mattered. New Hampshire Democrats waged a write-in campaign on his behalf, and he ended up easily winning that primary on Jan. 23.\n\nBut even though New Hampshire Democrats went first, South Carolina is the first officially sanctioned primary of this year\u2019s presidential contest.\n\nForget New Hampshire: South Carolina is the 'official' start of the Democratic nomination process\n\nThe Biden campaign and the Democratic Party are touting today's primary as the real start of the 2024 nomination race (such as it is) - last month's write-in effort in New Hampshire doesn't count.\n\nAt Biden's behest, the Democratic National Committee approved a new primary calendar that put South Carolina at the head of the line, ahead of traditional starters Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nAs the Associated Press put it, New Hampshire held a leadoff primary anyway in defiance of the DNC, but without the president\u2019s or the national party\u2019s backing and no delegates at stake.\"\n\n--David Jackson\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like?\n\nThere are about 3.3 million registered voters in South Carolina. Voters do not register by party. Turnout in the 2020 Democratic primary was about 16% of registered voters. It was about 13% in the 2016 primary.\n\nSaturday\u2019s event will be the first presidential primary held in the state since a new early voting law was enacted in May 2022. The law allows voters to cast ballots in person up to about two weeks before Election Day without an excuse. In the 2016 Democratic primary, when voters had to provide an excuse to cast an absentee ballot, about 14% of votes were cast before Election Day. In the 2022 midterm primaries, after the new law went into effect, pre-Election Day voting was at about 21%.\n\nAs of Monday, nearly 24,000 voters had already cast their ballots.\n\n--Michael Collins\n\nMore:What's the difference between a caucus and a primary election? Here's how each works.\n\nHow did Joe Biden fare in South Carolina in 2020?\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign was struggling when he marched into South Carolina four years ago. He had placed fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary. Before the polls in New Hampshire even closed, he decided to bail out on a planned campaign party and flew off to South Carolina, which his team believed could be the firewall that would turn their fortunes around.\n\nIt was a smart move.\n\nBiden easily won South Carolina, carrying all 46 of the state\u2019s counties and claiming 61% of the state\u2019s Black vote, which was pivotal to his victory. Biden\u2019s win in South Carolina gave him momentum heading into the Super Tuesday elections three days later. He would go on to capture the Democratic nomination and defeat incumbent Trump in the general election the following November.\n\nWhat is Biden up to on South Carolina primary day?\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, accompanied by First Lady Jill Biden and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, addressed a few hundred supporters at their campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nJoe Biden gave a six-minute speech thanking Americans for their support and hitting on his usual theme of preserving democracy by defeating former President Donald Trump in 2024.\n\n\u201cThis is more of a mission. We cannot lose this campaign. For the good of the country,\u201d Joe Biden said.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is Super Tuesday ?\n\nSuper Tuesday will be held on March 5. It marks the date when the greatest number of states hold their primaries and caucuses.\n\nThe states conducting elections on 2024's Super Tuesday include Alabama, Arkansas, Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nThe results of the Iowa Democratic caucus will also be announced on Super Tuesday.\n\n--Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden leads other candidates in South Carolina primary\n\nPresident Joe Biden is looking to place first in South Carolina, and an Emerson College poll shows the winds are in his favor.\n\nThe poll conducted between Jan. 2 and Jan. 3 found that sixty-nine percent of Democratic primary voters plan to support Biden, while 5% support Rep.

Twenty-two percent of Democratic primary voters are undecided.\n\n\u201cBiden holds a strong base of support among South Carolina Democrats, no alternative presents any challenge for the president,\u201d Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said. \u201cThe 22% still on the sidelines present an opportunity for Biden to begin his 2024 primary elections with a strong showing to open for the Democratic nomination.\"\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden's 2020 victory in South Carolina was a pivotal event\n\nVoters in today's South Carolina's Democratic primary are echoing one of the most pivotal races in political history: The 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary - the race that propelled Biden to the presidency.\n\nAt the start of the 2020 Democratic nomination process, Biden fared badly in Iowa and New Hampshire. He rallied in South Carolina with the help of an endorsement from long-time U.S. Rep Jim Clyburn, D-S.C.\n\nAfter his easy win in South Carolina, opponents began dropping out and endorsed Biden in his race against Bernie Sanders.\n\nBiden never looked back after South Carolina, going on to win the nomination and the general election against President Donald Trump.\n\n--David Jackson\n\nWhen is the 2024 Democratic primary?A state-by-state guide to the election schedule\n\nHow is Biden doing among Black voters this time?\n\nThis year, polls, including one from USA TODAY, show some Black voters aren\u2019t as excited about a Biden bid. Some young voters of color are upset Biden hasn\u2019t called for a cease-fire in the Israeli/Hamas war, in which thousands of Palestinians have been killed or injured.\n\nIn a Pew Research Center survey released in mid-January, nearly half of Black voters approved of Biden\u2019s job performance and about the same number disapproved.\n\nOne of Biden\u2019s key supporters, Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., is tamping down expectations for high Black voter turnout this year. Four years ago the Democratic field was more crowded, there was a global pandemic and the country was engulfed in social unrest.\n\n\u201cThe lay of the land is a little bit different (now),\" said Clyburn, one of the highest-ranking African Americans in Congress.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Biden reelection campaign are working overtime to turn out Black voters in the uncompetitive primary. Biden has visited the state twice this year; Vice President Kamala Harris has visited three times since the beginning of January. First lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff have also campaigned there.\n\nMore:When is the Nevada primary election and the caucus? What to know about the dual contests.\n\nWho else is running?\n\nBesides Biden, the other Democrats on the ballot are Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota and Marianne Williamson, an author and spiritual leader\n\nPhillips received about 20% of the vote in New Hampshire, while Williamson got about 4%. Williamson was part of the crowded 2020 field that included Biden, but she dropped out before the first contests.\n\nNeither poses a serious threat to Biden this year.\n\nSouth Carolina has an open primary election\n\nSouth Carolina has an open primary, which is a primary election where voters do not have to have a political party affiliation to vote for partisan candidates.\n\nThe South Carolina Election Commission states on its website that \u201cYou can pick either primary but you can only vote in one.\u201d\n\nVoters must have registered by Jan. 4 to participate in the Democratic primary. Those who vote during this time will not be allowed to vote during the Republican contest on Feb. 24.\n\n-- Nina Tran, Greenville News; Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat about Donald Trump and Nikki Haley\n\nVoters eagerly watching the GOP contest between Trump and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley will have to wait a little longer.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s Republican primary will be held on Feb. 24.\n\nWho can vote in South Carolina?\n\nSouth Carolina has an open primary system, which means any registered voter may participate in any party\u2019s primary. Voters may only participate in one party\u2019s presidential primary, so those who vote on Saturday may not vote in the Republican contest in three weeks.\n\nHow much longer until the finish line?\n\nAs of Saturday, there will be 198 days until the start of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and 276 days until the November general election.\n\n--Michael Collins\n\nContributing: The Associated Press and the Greenville News\n\n2024 election dates to know:Joe Biden, Donald Trump and other White House hopefuls face off"}

Even though it was Jon Bon Jovi\u2019s night, no one grumbled about the appearance of a Springsteen song and indeed, a singalong and dueling harmonicas marked a detour to \u201cThe Promised Land.\u201d\n\nBon Jovi was chosen as the honoree at the 33rd annual MusiCares event because of his charitable endeavors, including the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation and four locations of the JBJ Soul Kitchen, a non-profit community restaurant.\n\nMusiCares is the foundation arm of the Recording Academy, which produces the Grammy Awards, that provides aid, including emergency financial assistance, medical expenses, addiction recovery, disaster relief and treatment for critical illnesses to members of the music community.\n\nA stampede of eclectic performers, presenters and guests filled the room of about 2,000 including Melissa Etheridge, Shania Twain, Jason Isbell, Lainey Wilson, Ted Danson, Lenny Kravitz, Sammy Hagar, Gayle King, Kylie Minogue and Rita Wilson.\n\nBefore the show, Bon Jovi walked the red carpet and Torres acknowledged one of their frontman\u2019s prime accomplishments.\n\n\u201cJon has kept us together for 40 years and that isn\u2019t an easy thing to do,\u201d he said.\n\nHere are some of the standout performances of the two-hour-plus event, hosted by an appropriately ribbing Jim Gaffigan.\n\nMelissa Etheridge and Larkin Poe, \u2018Blaze of Glory\u2019\n\nThe march of the beat and the whine of the pedal steel guitar that power Jon Bon Jovi\u2019s Oscar-nominated solo hit from 1990 were tautly replicated by Etheridge and Larkin Poe\u2019s scintillating Rebecca and Megan Lovell.\n\nEtheridge, donning the requisite cowboy hat, unleashed her flammable voice, all grit and kerosene, on the deliberately plodding song, injecting it with her own cadence and drama as Larkin Poe augmented the cascade of guitars.\n\nJelly Roll, \u2018Bad Medicine\u2019\n\nThe double Grammy nominee who already straddles country and rock, sometimes with a smattering of hip-hop, showcased his versatility on a roaring rendition of \u201cBad Medicine.\u201d But that a cross-genre artist such as Jelly Roll can so readily execute the punchy rocker is also testament to the charm of Bon Jovi\u2019s catalog. \u201cYou\u2019ve inspired me my whole life,\u201d a visibly moved Jelly Roll told Bon Jovi.\n\nJason Isbell, \u2018Wanted Dead or Alive\u2019\n\nSeemingly paying tribute to original Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora with his black flat-brimmed hat, ebony trench coat and double-neck guitar, Isbell also nodded to the erstwhile musician with his vocal delivery. The song, which Jon Bon Jovi has called the band\u2019s \u201cnational anthem,\u201d prominently features Sambora\u2019s vocals on the chorus, and Isbell managed to nod to both Sambora and Bon Jovi with a voice full of gravel and defiance and a searing guitar solo.\n\nDamiano David, \u2018Keep the Faith\u2019\n\nThe magnetic frontman for Italian rockers M\u00e5neskin hit the stage solo this time, his tattooed skin bared under a black tank top. David is a captivating stage presence, but he\u2019s also the kind of singer capable of seducing and rocking in the same refrain \u2013 a handy trait for a song that dives and escalates.\n\nThe War and Treaty, \u2018I\u2019ll Be There for You\u2019\n\nThe Grammy-nominated couple needed only an upright bass, piano and acoustic guitar as the backdrop to the most potent vocal delivery of the show. The song is a declaration of devotion and between the elements of gospel implanted in the chorus and the incendiary vocals of Tanya and Michael Totter Jr. \u2013 the latter thoroughly nailing the lyric \u201cI wish I\u2019d seen you blow those candles out\u201d \u2013 the performance spurred a deserved ovation.\n\nMammoth WVH, \u2018Have a Nice Day\u2019\n\nBefore the show, Wolfgang Van Halen said he was a child when he first met Jon Bon Jovi, but that his late father, Eddie, always spoke fondly of their friendship. Bon Jovi specifically requested that Mammoth WVH \u2013 the only rock band playing the event - perform the sneering kiss off of a song (the title track of the band\u2019s 2005 album). Bon Jovi looked on, smiling paternally, as Van Halen\u2019s harmonious voice and limber-fingered guitar solo punctuated the anthem with melodic crunch.\n\nBrandy Clark, \u2018(You Want To) Make a Memory\u2019\n\nWith six nominations this year, Clark offered a pure, emotional version of the wistful ballad, a seesaw of aching nostalgia and cautious progression. Armed with her acoustic guitar, Clark was backed by a piano and cello for one of the most reflective songs in the Bon Jovi oeuvre."}

We're discussing important plot points and the ending of \"Argylle\" (in theaters now), so beware if you haven't seen it yet.\n\nWho is the real Agent Argylle? It\u2019s a mystery that gets revealed halfway through the spy comedy \u201cArgylle.\u201d More importantly, the movie's finale doles out clues to where the franchise goes next and which other film series it\u2019s eyeing for a crossover.\n\nIn director Matthew Vaughn\u2019s action-packed outing, reclusive spy novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) discovers her plots are veering uncannily close to espionage situations in the real world. Shaggy spy Aidan (Sam Rockwell) helps keep Elly and her pet cat Alfie safe when the bad guys from the villainous Division come after them as they search for a master file revealing rogue agents. Elly also has reality-bending visions of her flattop-rocking fictional Agent Argylle (Henry Cavill), and along the way, Aidan and Elly search for the real Argylle \u2026 who just happens to be Elly herself.\n\nWhat?! Add in the fact that in our real real world, there is an \u201cArgylle\u201d book written by someone named Elly Conway, and there\u2019s a whole lot to unpack, especially with different ways for the franchise to go. \u201cThere is so much potential with this to move in multiple directions, and most of them unexpected, when it comes to the continuation of this universe,\u201d Cavill says.\n\nLet\u2019s dig into the movie\u2019s biggest reveals:\n\nWhat is \u2018Argylle\u2019 about?\n\nSo much! The biggest deal is Elly\u2019s revealed to be a CIA operative named Rachel Kyle (\u201cR. Kyle,\u201d get it?). She got amnesia after a fall into the Thames while on assignment and had a whole fictional backstory brainwashed into her by evil Division head honcho Ritter (Bryan Cranston) and henchwoman Ruth (Catherine O\u2019Hara), who masquerade as Elly\u2019s mom and dad.\n\nBut here\u2019s another twist: Elly/Rachel, whose bestselling books were actually memories of her old adventures, turns out to be (gasp!) a Division double agent, and she\u2019s mind-controlled back to being a baddie. Love ultimately conquers all, though, and she and Aidan defeat the Division \u2013 with help from spy pal Keira (Ariana DeBose) \u2013 and upload the master file to ex-CIA deputy director Alfred Solomon (Samuel L. Jackson).\n\n'Argylle' review:A great spy comedy premise is buried by secret-agent chaos\n\nWhat happens at the ending of 'Argylle'?\n\nAfter saving the day, Howard\u2019s character goes back to being novelist Elly and she\u2019s at a book reading when, during a Q&A session, a square-jawed individual who\u2019s the spitting image of the fictional Argylle stands up \u2013 though Cavill has a mullet and a Southern drawl instead of the flattop and British accent as this mystery guy. Elly looks surprised when he says to her, \u201cI don\u2019t have a question. But you probably have one or two for me.\u201d\n\nVaughn is \u201cobsessed\u201d with mullets, he says. \u201cI thought a flattop in the beginning and a mullet at the end sort of hopefully makes you lean in and think, what the hell is that all about?\u201d But that tease to a potential sequel is \u201cjust to say we have a very fun storyline of Mullet Man, as we're calling him.\u201d\n\nIs there an \u2018Argylle\u2019 post-credit scene?\n\nAffirmative! The scene starts 20 years earlier, at an English pub in the country called The King\u2019s Man. A young man (Louis Partridge) walks in, introduces himself as Aubrey Argylle and says he's been sent there. A bartender bends down to pull out a wooden box that has a gun in it. \u201cNow that\u2019s a twist,\u201d Argylle says as it cuts to black.\n\nVaughn explains that the movie plot revolves around \u201cArgylle\u201d books four and five, but this scene is actually from the first \u201cArgylle\u201d book, a real-deal spy novel that\u2019s been released in stores and written by an \u201cElly Conway.\u201d So this is a sneak peek at what a prequel could look like. That pub name also seems to be a gigantic tell that \u201cArgylle\u201d takes place in the same universe as Vaughn\u2019s other spy franchise, \u201cKingsman,\u201d with Taron Egerton and Colin Firth.\n\n\u201cAll I'll say as a clue is not many people can make the beautiful Nehru collared suits that Argylle wears with pride,\u201d Vaughn says, nodding to the Kingsman organization\u2019s use of a London tailor shop as a front for its espionage escapades.\n\nSo who wrote \u2018Argylle\u2019? Is it Taylor Swift?\n\nFor a while during the run-up to the movie release, nobody really knew the identity of the Elly Conway behind the \u201cArgylle\u201d book, and it became a strangely viral mystery. An online conspiracy theory even popped up that Taylor Swift is Elly Conway because the movie character has the same kind of cat, a Scottish Fold, as the pop superstar. Vaughn even smacked down those rumors.\n\nOn Friday, the Telegraph in England finally dropped the news that Elly Conway is actually two writers: Australian author Terry Hayes (\"I Am Pilgrim\") and British thriller novelist Tammy Cohen. \"It has been one of the most magnificently surreal experiences of my life and I've enjoyed (almost) every minute,\" Cohen wrote on X.\n\nAt least that's one less secret for Vaughn to keep. \"The only thing anybody asks me bloody questions about is Elly Conway,\" he said before the reveal.\n\nWhat is TAYLOR-CON?Taylor Swift's management group files trademark application"}

The Washington Post could not independently verify the figures.\n\nIraq, a strategic ally of the United States, said it had summoned David Burger, the U.S. charge d\u2019affaires in Baghdad, to hand him a letter of protest following the raids that killed at least 16 Iraqis and injured 25 in the Akashat and al-Qaim areas of the western province of Anbar.\n\nAn Iraqi government spokesman described the American airstrikes as \u201cblatant aggression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis aggressive strike places the security in Iraq and the region on the edge of the abyss, conflicting with efforts to establish the required stability,\u201d spokesman Basim al-Awadi said. He said the government rejected the use of Iraqi soil as a \u201cbattleground for settling scores.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the Iraqi government said that the 16 deaths included an unspecified number of civilians, Iraq\u2019s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), which includes an array of militia factions including some linked to Iran, attributed the same number of casualties \u2014 16 deaths and 25 injuries \u2014 to its fighters. It released a list of their names.\n\nSeparately, an Iraqi official in Anbar province, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject, said at least two civilians were killed near al-Qaim on the Syrian border, where weapons depots were targeted, putting the potential number of deaths in the country at 18. Shiekh Hani Al-Awad, a tribal leader from the area, also confirmed the death of two civilians.\n\nIraqi officials did not respond to queries on the discrepancies.\n\nThe PMF is made up of largely Shiite militias that rallied to fight Islamic State militants in 2014 after they overran swathes of Iraq and Syria. The United States also sent troops to support ground and air operations against the Islamic State, and still has a few thousand troops stationed in Iraq and Syria, with a stated mission of preventing the group\u2019s resurgence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while they were briefly united in a shared goal, the more hardline Iran-backed proxies soon turned their efforts toward pushing U.S. forces from the region.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe PMF has since been absorbed by Iraq\u2019s formal security forces, while pro-Iran militias coalesced under the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group. The Islamic Resistance of Iraq claimed responsibility for the lethal drone attack against U.S. troops in Jordan on Jan. 28.\n\nThe group also said on Saturday that it had launched two new attacks on U.S. troop positions in response to the airstrikes, including one at the Harir airbase in northern Iraq and a second on a base in Kharab al-Jeer in northeastern Syria.\n\nA spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military coalition supporting Iraq\u2019s fight against Islamic State militants, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve been bold enough to pop their heads up above the parapet today and launch attacks at U.S. troops speaks volumes about their confidence,\u201d Lister said of the Islamic Resistance\u2019s claims on Saturday.\n\n\u201cNow the ball is in America\u2019s court again,\" he said. \"Is the second round more aggressive? Does the second round include an attempt to target a high-value Iranian-linked operative as another way of trying to send a deterrent message? Or is it just more of the same?\u201d\n\nProxy groups would be happy to return to \u201cchipping away at American credibility and deployments,\u201d he said.\n\nAbdolrasool Divsallar, an Iran specialist and professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan said that the Biden administration appeared to strike a balance between deterrence and deescalation. Iran had nearly a week to prepare for the U.S. response.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been evacuating their personnel and assets,\u201d Divsallar said, adding that Iran knows further retaliation could cause an \u201cescalation loop.\u201d Both Washington and Tehran have signaled they want to avoid further conflict, he added, saying he expected the response from proxy groups on the ground to remain \u201clow intensity.\u201d\n\nU.S. Central Command said on Friday that more than 125 precision munitions were fired at assets belonging to \u201cmilitia groups and their [Iranian military] sponsors who facilitated attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces\u201d during the attack.\n\nIranian proxies in the Middle East have escalated attacks on the United States and Israel since the start of the war in Gaza. Israel has responded with a military campaign that has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deaths of Spec. Breonna A. Moffett, 23, Sgt. William J. Rivers, 46, and Spec. Kennedy L. Sanders, 24 were the first in what the Institute for the Study of War says has been more than 170 attacks on U.S. military bases in the region, mainly in Syria and Iraq, since Oct. 7. More than 50 troops were wounded, at least one critically, in the strike on Tower 22, a key support base for the larger U.S. installation at Tanf in Syria.\n\nThe United States has launched dozens of retaliatory strikes since Oct. 7, including one in Baghdad that killed a senior commander of al-Nujaba."}

Choose your plan ArrowRight \u201cSnoopy Presents: Welcome Home, Franklin,\u201d premiering Feb. 16 on Apple TV Plus, will focus on Franklin\u2019s origin story. The trailer, released Friday, shows that after moving to a new neighborhood, Franklin Armstrong initially struggles to fit in, with kids passing him by as he tries to strike up conversations. He vows to make new friends and win the town\u2019s Soap Box Derby race with his partner, Charlie Brown.\n\nIn a lighthearted part of trailer, Charlie asks Franklin about his music taste, to which Franklin gushes about James Brown: \u201cYou\u2019re not related, are you?\u201d Franklin asks, comparing James Brown\u2019s face to Charlie\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe special was co-written by Robb Armstrong \u2014 the \u201cJumpStart\u201d creator who inspired Franklin\u2019s surname \u2014 along with Charles M.

Franklin is again settled in a controversially placed chair \u2014 but this time, he\u2019s given an upgrade.\n\n\u201cHey Franklin!

Fans applauded Franklin\u2019s new chair on social media, noting how the move symbolically honored the character that effectively integrated \u201cPeanuts\u201d in an era where racial segregation was still commonplace.\n\nFranklin was introduced into the \u201cPeanuts\u201d comic universe in 1968, after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spurred retired teacher Harriet Glickman to ask Charles Schulz and other prominent comic artists to racially integrate their work.\n\nAdvertisement"}

Those who knew him won\u2019t find it surprising that his life ended that way. The former CIA analyst was known in the international intelligence community for his critical thinking skills and analytic techniques. He wrote books on the subject and gave lectures on the topic. Thought leaders turned to him to get his thoughts on thinking.\n\nBut in the last several years, Pherson faced his hardest-to-solve problem: How to improve the medical experiences and outcomes of people with a rare disease?\n\nIn 2021, after experiencing a constellation of concerning and painful symptoms for seven years that left doctors stumped, Pherson became critically ill while traveling in Iceland with his wife and a group of close friends. Through a series of fortuitous connections \u2014 ones that Pherson talked about in a Washington Post article that detailed his medical mystery \u2014 he finally received a diagnosis from the National Institutes of Health in 2022. He learned that he had a rare inflammatory disease called VEXAS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of VEXAS, you are far from alone. Most medical professionals haven\u2019t heard of it, which means many have sat in front of undiagnosed patients and not been able to give them answers or help.\n\nPherson hoped to change that.\n\n\u201cHe felt very strongly about getting the word out,\u201d his wife of 50 years, Kathy Pherson, told me on a recent afternoon. \u201cHe felt so strongly about number one, surviving himself and getting on the other side of this, and number two, being able to share his experience and helping others find some relief.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Kathy Pherson buried her husband, who was 74 and known to many as Randy. And on Friday, she held a celebration of life for him that hundreds of people attended.\n\nBut even on a week dedicated to grieving her husband\u2019s death, Pherson spent time thinking about how to give life to the project they were supposed to work on together. The two worked at the CIA for 28 years, raised two children and wrote books together. Their latest plans called for turning their nonprofit organization into one focused on bringing global awareness to VEXAS and providing a community for those impacted by it.\n\nOn Jan. 11, the day Pherson died, the couple were scheduled to have their first meeting about starting the VEXAS Global Foundation with Dr. Janet Baker, a close family friend who took Pherson to his many medical appointments, and Dr. Marcela Ferrada, a rheumatologist who helped discover VEXAS and now works at the University of Maryland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI spoke with all three women, and they talked with conviction and urgency about creating what Randy Pherson envisioned. They talked about the frustration that people with rare diseases experience when physicians don\u2019t listen to them, even though those patients usually know more about their conditions than most medical providers. They talked about the dangers and missed opportunities that arise when different specialists treating the same patient don\u2019t communicate. They talked about the pain Pherson endured during the last years of his life.\n\nVEXAS, which is estimated to affect 1 in 4,000 men over 50, can cause symptoms that include painful rashes, swollen joints, abnormal blood counts, shortness of breath, fevers and extreme fatigue.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cWe need to do this for him,\u201d Kathy Pherson said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see other people have to go through what he went through.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrada, who met Randy Pherson after his diagnosis and helped manage his care for almost two years, went to the couple\u2019s home on the day they were supposed to discuss the foundation. By then, Pherson was mostly unresponsive. Ferrada sat next to him and held his hand.\n\n\u201cI felt horrible because I really wanted to have that discussion with Randy, and he really wanted to have that discussion,\u201d she said. She recalled telling him, \u201cI know this is very important to you, and I promise you that I am going to do everything in my power to help patients with VEXAS, and we\u2019re going to do it in your name.\u201d\n\nThe last word she recalled him saying was, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think what Randy wanted to do is something that is going to have a tremendous impact, not only in the United States, but also in other places,\u201d Ferrada said. She described the foundation as providing hope \u2014 hope to patients and hope to physicians. She said the foundation plan to address VEXAS from various angles. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be awareness. It\u2019s going to be access to diagnosis. It\u2019s going to be teaching. It\u2019s going to be research.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s going to be creating a program where people with VEXAS can go to see a rheumatologist who understands the condition. Ferrada, who also has a rare condition, plans to create that at the University of Maryland.\n\nJanet Baker took Pherson to most of his medical appointments. That view allowed her to see the ways the country\u2019s medical system fails to help people with rare diseases.\n\n\u201cHe really pushed the system further than the system was designed to go, and it needed to be pushed more,\u201d Baker said. She ended up going to the emergency room with him more than a half-dozen times in the last six months. She said she went with him as a friend, not as his physician, but her presence and knowledge of his condition at times made a difference. \u201cThere were a few instances as recently as this fall where they took what I said to heart and what I said changed their treatment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther people should also have access to experts, she said. These are the types of conversations she, Ferrada and Pherson now have. Some of the questions they have been asking: What are the needs? What are the best ways to address them? How would Randy apply analytic techniques to the problem?\n\nFor a book he published in 2020, Pherson applied those techniques to medical care. The title of that book was, \u201cHow to Get the Right Diagnosis: 16 Tips for Navigating the Medical System.\u201d What he wanted to call it, his wife said, was this: \u201cQuestions to ask your doctor if you don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would have been all in on this,\u201d she said of the foundation. \u201cWe have done things together as a team for more than 50 years, and when I think, \u2018What would he want me to do with this,\u2019 it\u2019s a pretty easy answer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA GoFundMe page the women created to support the effort reads, \u201cNo better memorial exists for Randy than to help us fulfill his dream of spreading the word about VEXAS \u2014 how to get tested, how to manage the symptoms, and how to share and learn from the experience of others.\u201d"}

As eight franchises jostled to find new head coaches, there was no procedural buffoonery, no blatant rule circumvention, no hasty and ill-fitting decisions. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight For once, these billionaire toys functioned like serious organizations. Unfair practices usually mar the carousel, but most of the cries of injustice were about Bill Belichick, the dour conductor of the New England Patriots\u2019 six-championship dynasty who didn\u2019t get a job after a 29-38 record over the past four seasons. The rest were about a Belichick prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Mike Vrabel, a coach who hit the market after two losing seasons and friction with Tennessee Titans General Manager Ran Carthon.\n\nIn other words, nothing unfair occurred.\n\nCapitulation to Belichick-ian behavior is unmistakably pass\u00e9 now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith one quarter of the league\u2019s 32 coaching jobs open, the stakes couldn\u2019t have been higher, and the 2024 hiring period ended with encouraging results. Of the eight hires, half are men of color: three Black coaches (Raheem Morris, Antonio Pierce and Jerod Mayo) and one Mexican American (Dave Canales). But the pursuit of enhanced diversity isn\u2019t limited to race, ethnicity and gender. It\u2019s about minimizing groupthink and expanding copycat minds so there\u2019s a place for new people with fresh ideas \u2014 no matter their identity \u2014 to be leaders in a game that tends to get stale easily despite its immense popularity.\n\nFive of the eight new coaches have defensive backgrounds, challenging the breathless notion that teams are now better off being steered by offensive gurus. The youth movement continued with six of those coaches under age 50, including three who have yet to celebrate their 40th birthdays. And a few surprise hires, such as the Titans picking Brian Callahan and the Carolina Panthers turning to Canales, hinted at teams thinking more about fit and organizational alignment than familiar names who probably won\u2019t win much more than a news conference.\n\nAt least half of these coaches are destined to fail, but that\u2019s simply the unfortunate nature of the sport. Even if that happens, it doesn\u2019t diminish the value of an equitable and open-minded process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe point is opportunity. It always has been. Aspiring head coaches want general managers, presidents and owners to actually study their league. Once you take out assumptions, conduct real interviews and act with intentionality about researching overlooked talent, you\u2019re no longer a detriment to inclusion.\n\nIt only took the NFL more than a century of systemic racism, generations of traumatized coaches, multiple Rooney Rule enhancements, draft pick compensation for developing minority coaches and executives, multiple other policies, a Brian Flores-led racial discrimination lawsuit and intense public scrutiny to make a purposeful move in the right direction. There is no single factor that contributed to the sport nearly doubling its minority representation in one hiring period, raising the head count to a record nine head coaches of color next season. And that\u2019s the most positive sign.\n\nMorris, formerly an assistant and interim coach with the Atlanta Falcons, has had a good relationship with the franchise and owner Arthur Blank. Pierce went 5-4 as the Las Vegas Raiders interim coach, fixing some of the mess Josh McDaniels made, and owner Mark Davis couldn\u2019t again pass over a successful interim after ditching Rich Bisaccia three years ago to make the mistake with McDaniels. In New England, owner Robert Kraft honored a coach-in-waiting agreement with Mayo and quickly elevated him to succeed Belichick. Despite the Patriots\u2019 struggles since parting with Tom Brady, Kraft was adamant about maintaining the organizational culture. He just didn\u2019t want Belichick as the primary steward anymore.\n\nCanales was the pick in Carolina partly because he worked with new general manager Dan Morgan in Seattle. Organic relationships and networking still mean the most.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut without a policy cocktail to make teams pause and think differently, the race to get any coach with a reputation would continue to be a problem. In this cycle, some teams interviewed as many as 15 candidates. The Rooney Rule now requires franchises to do in-person interviews with at least two minority or female coaches from outside the organization for a head coach or GM job. They also must interview two such candidates for all coordinator positions.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIt\u2019s much harder now to lock in on one candidate and conduct disingenuous interviews with the others. Front offices used to scout undrafted free agents better than they researched potential coaches. The eight teams with new leaders also came away with a deeper understanding of the entire pipeline.\n\nEvery year at this time, they brace for judgment at NFL headquarters in midtown Manhattan. For all the strategies league employees have devised to foster diversity, they know perception comes down to this high-profile problem. Racial equity is the longest game they will ever play, and the NFL has been trailing progress forever, which feeds the impulse to watch the scoreboard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost years, they\u2019re left to react to failure. Sometimes, they\u2019re resolute. Sometimes, they\u2019re exasperated. Sometimes, they\u2019re in denial or defensive or as angry at their billionaire bosses as they can safely be. Mostly, though, they\u2019re somber. Until it proves otherwise, the most powerful league in America does not want to solve the saddest example of institutional sports bias, and the diversity advocates within the NFL somehow bear a greater burden than the decision-makers who don\u2019t have to answer to them, or seemingly anyone else.\n\n\u201cThis kind of work is tough, and I have gotten very emotional over this,\u201d NFL senior vice president and chief diversity and inclusion officer Jonathan Beane admitted once during an interview. \u201cWe put a lot of emotion, sweat and tears into it. It\u2019s very personal to us. A lot of people are depending on us.\u201d\n\nFor once, Beane can relax, if only for the briefest moment. Troy Vincent, the league\u2019s executive vice president of football operations, can see evidence that reinforces the importance of his passion, ideas and audacity. They\u2019re just two of many in the league office trying to make a decentralized cluster of 32 competing teams commit to a shared value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s possible to dream again. In a year, the story could be much different if several marquee franchises with uncertain futures are in the market for coaches at a time when Belichick, Vrabel, Pete Carroll and hyped offensive coordinators Ben Johnson and Bobby Slowik are again available.\n\nBut for now, in the afterglow DeMeco Ryans\u2019s stunning debut with the Houston Texans, teams are flirting with diversity. It feels like a moment. If not, it\u2019s an opportunity at least. Success alone won\u2019t defeat bias, but it is a potent weapon."}

Neither did the second time when he was laid off from ZipRecruiter. By the third time, though, Chavez had had enough.\n\n\u201cI really loved what I did,\u201d said Phoenix-based Chavez in a text message. \u201cBut the layoffs got me jaded.\u201d Now he\u2019s pursuing a graduate degree in psychology.\n\nChavez is one of hundreds of thousands of tech workers who\u2019ve been laid off in the past two years in what now seems like a never-ending wave of cuts that has upended the culture of Silicon Valley and the expectations of those who work at some of America\u2019s richest and most powerful companies.\n\nLast year, tech companies laid off more than 260,000 workers according to layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi, cuts that executives mostly blamed on \u201cover-hiring\u201d during the pandemic and high interest rates making it harder to invest in new business ventures. But as those layoffs have dragged into 2024 despite stabilizing interest rates and a booming job market in other industries, the tech workforce is feeling despondent and confused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. economy added 353,000 jobs in January, a huge boost that was around twice what economists had expected. And yet, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Discord, Salesforce and eBay all made significant cuts in January, and the layoffs don\u2019t seem to be abating. On Tuesday, PayPal said in a letter to workers it would cut another 2,500 employees or about 9 percent of its workforce.\n\nThe continued cuts come as companies are under pressure from investors to improve their bottom lines. Wall Street\u2019s sell-off of tech stocks in 2022 pushed companies to win back investors by focusing on increasing profits, and firing some of the tens of thousands of workers hired to meet the pandemic boom in consumer tech spending. With many tech companies laying off workers, cutting employees no longer signaled weakness. Now, executives are looking for more places where they can squeeze more work out of fewer people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to be careful on what we invest in, and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in new things and new areas and things that resonate with customers. And where we can find efficiencies and do more with less, we\u2019re going to do that as well,\u201d Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said in response to a reporter\u2019s question during a Thursday media earnings call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat is the way the American capitalist system works,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cIt\u2019s ruthless when it gets down to striving for profitability and creating wealth. It redirects resources very rapidly from one place to another.\u201d\n\nEconomic concerns and inflation in 2022 and 2023 also cut into the amount of software and cloud services that businesses were buying, said Gil Luria, a tech analyst with D.A. Davidson Co.\n\n\u201cThat rippled through the entire software ecosystem, and looking into 2024, it seems like the most recent data points are things are no longer getting worse but they\u2019re not getting better yet,\u201d Luria said. \u201cTheir customers haven\u2019t loosened the purse strings.\u201d\n\nUnable to get back to the showstopping revenue growth of years past, tech executives are opting instead to put a positive spin on things for Wall Street by continuously cutting high-paid workers instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt seems to be working. In 2022, the Nasdaq Composite, a stock index dominated by tech companies, lost a full third of its value. In 2023, it grew by 43 percent. It rose another 3 percent in January.\n\nShine has come off the tech industry\n\nAs stocks have risen, spirits in the San Francisco Bay Area \u2014 the heart of the U.S. tech industry \u2014 have only fallen further. The power that tech workers felt they commanded to switch jobs and win higher salaries and meatier stock awards has partly evaporated.\n\nFor many tech workers, the shine has come off an industry that they had given their lives to in return for steady employment, flashy perks and the chance for lucrative stock options. Google and Meta in recent years have cut down on employee perks like free laundry, free massages, and food and fitness offerings. \u201cSeems like tech has changed forever since mass layoffs,\u201d an anonymous worker posted to the workplace gossip app Blind this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very new to feel job insecurity,\u201d said Julia Grummel, a former senior product designer for a Bay Area software company. Since being laid off in February 2023, Grummel says she has received rejections from automated systems, been ghosted by employers after several rounds of interviews and gotten rejections without any feedback. And she\u2019s facing competition from huge numbers of other laid-off workers like herself.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nShe has gotten interest from some companies that have already cut employees, but she\u2019s wary of them, Grummel said. \u201cI am not really interested in joining an organization that has demonstrated that they don\u2019t value the people who are keeping the business running.\u201d\n\nLike Chavez, she says she\u2019s beginning to think of looking for other kinds of work, focusing less on pay and more on jobs that may provide better work-life balance and more meaning and fulfillment, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven workers with years of experience or deep technical expertise are having trouble getting hired again.\n\nParker Lopez, a machine learning engineer and data scientist in Seattle, was laid off from his job at a health tech start-up in May 2023. The last time he was on the job market several years ago it only took him three months to find work. But this time he\u2019s applied for more than 1,000 roles without any success.\n\n\u201cIt feels very futile,\u201d he said.\n\nEven with several years of experience in software engineering, data science and manufacturing, including at Microsoft, laid-off Amazon contractor Jennifer Pearl said landing an interview has been tough. Pearl said previously they were able to land a job in a matter of days.\n\n\u201cI am worried,\u201d they said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this stuff for 20 years \u2026 and right now I\u2019m lucky to get a call back. \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the more recent layoffs are targeting middle-managers who ran the teams that were hit in previous waves of cuts. Some of them are trying to return to jobs where they write code rather than direct the work of others, calculating that those roles might be safer. Workers who tried to hop from company to company every three or four years to maximize the amount of stock options they could amass are now staying put.\n\nTech workers have also been exposed to a year of nonstop discussion of the artificial intelligence boom and its potential impact on the workforce. Many programmers use AI tools to help them write code faster, and executives and tech pundits frequently talk about how much more efficient workers will become in the near future.\n\nStarry-eyed AI executives argue that as workers become more productive, companies will make more money, resulting in more growth and more jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut tech workers themselves aren\u2019t so sure. Neither are economists.\n\n\u201cThe tech sector may be able to produce a lot and innovate a lot without as many people going forward,\u201d Zandi, the Moody\u2019s economist, said. \u201cThat is a lesson of AI.\u201d\n\nOnce glitzy, high-paying and highly coveted, tech jobs have become less secure and less attractive to many in recent years. As a result, workers are more willing to take a lower-paying job, make a lateral move, or seek out alternative job opportunities.\n\nFor a former Meta user experience researcher in the Bay Area, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid hurting her future employment prospects, the job hunt has been tough since her layoff last April. Originally employed in academia, she joined the industry to expand her knowledge and ensure job security, good benefits and higher pay."}

(AP) \u2014 Marilyn Manson, who was sentenced to community service for blowing his nose on a videographer at a 2019 concert in New Hampshire, recently completed his time at an organization that provides meeting space for Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon, according to court paperwork.\n\nThe shock rocker, 55, spent 20 hours last month at the Windsor Club of Glendale, a California nonprofit that provides meeting locations for Alcoholics Anonymous and families of alcoholics to \u201cachieve a more meaningful life through recovery,\u201d according to the group\u2019s website.\n\nA certificate of completion was filed by the Assistance League of Los Angeles with a New Hampshire court on Jan. 30. Manson had to file proof of his service by Feb. 4.\n\nManson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, pleaded no contest in September to the misdemeanor charge in Laconia, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Concord, the state capital.\n\nA no contest plea means Manson did not contest the charge and did not admit guilt.\n\nHe initially was charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault stemming from the encounter with the videographer at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford on Aug. 19, 2019. The second charge, alleging that he spit on the videographer, was dropped.\n\nManson also was fined. He needs to remain arrest-free and notify local police of any New Hampshire performances for two years.\n\nProsecutor Andrew Livernois had said it was his first offense and he had no prior record.\n\nManson initially pleaded not guilty to both charges in 2021. His lawyer had said that the type of filming the videographer was doing commonly exposes videographers to \u201cincidental contact\u201d with bodily fluids.\n\nManson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like \u201cThe Beautiful People\u201d and hit albums like 1996\u2019s \u201cAntichrist Superstar\u201d and 1998\u2019s \u201cMechanical Animals.\u201d\n\nLast year, a California judge threw out key sections of Manson\u2019s lawsuit against his former fianc\u00e9e, \u201cWestworld\u201d actor Evan Rachel Wood, claiming she fabricated public allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship and encouraged other women to do the same. He is appealing the ruling. The judge recently ruled that Manson cover Wood\u2019s legal fees, according to Rolling Stone.\n\nManson\u2019s lawsuit, filed last year, alleges that Wood and another woman named as a defendant, Illma Gore, defamed Manson, intentionally caused him emotional distress and derailed his career in music, TV and film.\n\nSeveral women have sued Manson in recent years with allegations of sexual and other abuse. Most have been dismissed or settled, including a suit filed by \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esm\u00e9 Bianco.\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly."}

Under a prior multimillion-dollar deal, \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d had been a Spotify exclusive since 2020.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which first reported the new deal on Friday, estimated that the new contract was worth as much as $250 million over its multiyear term.

It's the Supreme Court's biggest election test since Bush v. Gore", "domain": "apnews.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMITuzgEw4fQo", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A case with the potential to disrupt Donald Trump\u2019s drive to return to the White House is putting the Supreme Court uncomfortably at the center of the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nIn arguments Thursday, the justices will, for the first time, wrestle with a constitutional provision that was adopted after the Civil War to prevent former officeholders who \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d from reclaiming power.\n\nThe case is the court\u2019s most direct involvement in a presidential election since Bush v. Gore, a decision delivered a quarter-century ago that effectively delivered the 2000 election to Republican George W. Bush. It comes to a court that has been buffeted by criticism over ethics, which led the justices to adopt their first code of conduct in November, and at a time when public approval of the court is diminished, at near-record lows in surveys.\n\nThe dispute stems from the push by Republican and independent voters in Colorado to kick Trump off the state\u2019s Republican primary ballot because of his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nColorado\u2019s highest court determined that Trump incited the riot in the nation\u2019s capital and is ineligible to be president again as a result and should not be on the ballot for the state\u2019s primary on March 5.\n\nA victory for the Colorado voters would amount to a declaration from the justices, who include three appointed by Trump when he was president, that he did engage in insurrection and is barred by the 14th Amendment from holding office again. That would allow states to keep him off the ballot and imperil his campaign.\n\nA definitive ruling for Trump would largely end efforts in Colorado, Maine and elsewhere to prevent his name from appearing on the ballot.\n\nThe justices could opt for a less conclusive outcome, but with the knowledge that the issue could return to them, perhaps after the general election in November and in the midst of a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n\nDonald Trump is facing four criminal indictments, and a civil lawsuit. You can track all of the cases here.\n\nThe court has signaled it will try to act quickly, dramatically shortening the period in which it receives written briefing and holds arguments in the courtroom.\n\nTrump is separately appealing to state court a ruling by Maine\u2019s Democratic secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, that he was ineligible to appear on that state\u2019s ballot over his role in the Capitol attack. Both the Colorado Supreme Court and the Maine secretary of state\u2019s rulings are on hold until the appeals play out.\n\nThe former president is not expected to attend the Supreme Court session this coming week, though he has shown up for court proceedings in the civil lawsuits and criminal charges he is fighting.\n\nWhatever the justices decide, they are likely to see more of Trump, who is facing criminal charges related to Jan. 6 and other issues. Other election-related litigation also is possible.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks after meeting with members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at their headquarters in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2024. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nIn 2000, in Bush v. Gore, the court and the parties were divided over whether the justices should intervene at all.\n\nThe conservative-driven 5-4 decision has been heavily criticized ever since, especially given that the court cautioned against using the case as precedent when the unsigned majority opinion declared that \u201cour consideration is limited to the present circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn the current case, both parties want the matter settled, and quickly.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign declined to make anyone available for this story, but his lawyers urged the justices not to delay.\n\n\u201cThe Court should put a swift and decisive end to these ballot-disqualification efforts, which threaten to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans and which promise to unleash chaos and bedlam if other state courts and state officials follow Colorado\u2019s lead and exclude the likely Republican presidential nominee from their ballots,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote.\n\nDonald Sherman, the top lawyer at the group behind the ballot challenge, said voters and election officials need to have an answer quickly.\n\n\u201cAnd I think, obviously, voters have a not small interest in knowing whether the Supreme Court thinks, as every fact-finder that has reached this question, that Jan. 6 was an insurrection and that Donald Trump is an insurrectionist,\u201d Sherman said in an interview with The Associated Press. He is executive vice president and chief legal counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas is the only sitting member of the court who was on the bench for Bush v. Gore. He was part of that majority.\n\nThe U.S Supreme Court is photographed on Friday, Jan. 5, 2024, in Washington. The Supreme Court will decide whether former President Donald Trump can be kept off the 2024 presidential ballot because of his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss that culminated in the U.S. Capitol attack. The justices Friday agreed to take a Colorado case, inserting themselves in the presidential campaign and acknowledging the need to decide quickly. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)\n\nBut three other justices joined the legal fight on Bush\u2019s side: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Bush eventually put Roberts on a federal appeals court and then appointed him chief justice. Bush hired Kavanaugh to important White House jobs before making him an appellate judge, too.\n\nKavanaugh and Barrett were elevated to the Supreme Court by Trump, who also appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nThomas has ignored calls by some Democratic lawmakers and ethics professors to step aside from the current case. They note that his wife, Ginni Thomas, supported Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Ginni Thomas repeatedly texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in the weeks after that election, once referring to it as a \u201cheist,\u201d and she attended the rally that preceded the storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters. Nearly two years later, she told the congressional committee investigating the attack that she regretted sending the texts.\n\nTrump lost 60 different court challenges to his false claims that there was massive voter fraud that would have changed the results of that election.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled repeatedly against Trump and his allies in 2020 election-related lawsuits, as well as his efforts to keep documents related to Jan. 6 and his tax returns from being turned over to congressional committees.\n\nBut the conservative majority Trump\u2019s appointees cemented has produced decisions that overturned the 5-decade-old constitutional right to abortion, expanded gun rights and struck down affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nThe issue of whether Trump can be on the ballot is just one among several matters related to the former president or Jan. 6 that have reached the high court. The justices declined a request from special counsel Jack Smith to rule swiftly on Trump\u2019s claims that he is immune from prosecution, though the issue could be back before the court soon depending on the ruling of a Washington-based appeals court.\n\nIn April, the court will hear an appeal that could upend hundreds of charges stemming from the Capitol riot, including against Trump."}

Hillsides and canyons scarred by recent wildfires are particularly prone to washouts.\n\nWIDESPREAD RISKS\n\nFlood hazards from the impending storm abound, the weather service said in its notice on Friday, warning in upper-case letters: \"All areas, including highly populated urban areas, will be at risk for life-threatening flooding.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles, the height of the encroaching storm is expected to coincide with the music industry's Grammy Awards show on Sunday, prompting organizers to set up large tents for the pre-ceremony red carpet procession of the stars.\n\nElsewhere, crews were busy filling and stacking sandbags and clearing storm drains and culverts.\n\nFlash-flood watches were also in effect along a relatively narrow stretch of California's Central Coast, including Big Sur, extending north into the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nHigh winds in those areas may prove to be a bigger factor than rain, said Daniel Swain, a meteorologist and climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Southern California remains the focal point of flood risks, he added.\n\nSki areas, on the other hand, were looking forward to a bonanza, as snowfalls measuring 2-4 feet (60-120 cm) are expected in the higher-elevation mountains, the NWS said.\n\nFrozen precipitation from the storm will also benefit the region's snowpack, helping to rebuild a key source of freshwater that has lagged below normal despite last year's record-breaking winter storms.\n\nMuch of the region on Friday was still cleaning up from heavy rains that swept northern and southern portions of the state on Wednesday and Thursday, triggering scattered street flooding, rock slides and mud flows.\n\nBoth storms formed from vast airborne currents of dense moisture called atmospheric rivers. They also fit the definition of a storm system known as a \"Pineapple Express,\" drawing on especially warm, subtropical waters around the Hawaiian islands.\n\nAbout a dozen atmospheric river storms lashed California in rapid succession last winter, causing mass evacuations, power outages, levee breaches and road closures in a state long preoccupied with drought and wildfires. At least 20 people perished in those storms, which nevertheless helped break the grip of a years-long drought in California.\n\n(Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and William Mallard)"}

But lawmakers in Orban's governing Fidesz party told Reuters on Thursday they would \"wait\" with a final vote until a meeting of Orban and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.\n\nOrban's press chief did not respond to a Reuters query on Friday on when the meeting might take place.\n\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in a video posted by the government spokesman on X later on Friday that it would be \"fair\" if Kristersson visited Budapest before the ratification of Sweden's NATO bid, just as the Swedish leader had also gone to Turkey before the Turkish ratification,\n\n\"The ball is in your court SwedishPM,\" government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said on X.\n\nOrban has a commanding majority in parliament which he has often used to ram through legislation, in some cases overnight, with his party's lawmakers rubber-stamping policy changes.\n\nPressure rose on Orban to speed up the Swedish ratification process after senior U.S. lawmakers said they wanted Hungary to immediately approve Sweden's accession, suggesting it risked lasting damage to relations with Washington if it did not act.\n\n'TO THE WALL'\n\nHungary has not overtly made any demands of NATO as it drags its feet on approving Sweden's accession.\n\nAgreement on the EU aid for Ukraine finally came quickly on Thursday after Hungary's prolonged resistance. Budapest has refused to send arms to Ukraine since Russia's invasion and its ties with Kyiv have been marred by tension over the treatment of 150,000 ethnic Hungarians living in western Ukraine.\n\nOrban has been a vocal critic of the EU's financial and military support for Ukraine and has maintained ties with the Kremlin throughout the war.\n\n\"I went to the wall,\" Orban said in a radio broadcast.\n\n\"If this deal had not been reached and Hungary had continued to use its right of veto then 26 member states would have agreed to send the money to Ukraine ... and would have taken away the funds earmarked for Hungary and sent that to Ukraine as well -- why would that have been good?\".\n\nUnder EU practices, it is not possible for money allotted to a member state in the bloc's budget, or in what is known as the recovery fund, to be given away to a country outside the EU.\n\nAfter freeing up access to some tranches of EU funds in December to Hungary, the executive European Commission is still withholding some 20 billion euros from Budapest over accusations that Orban has damaged democracy at home during his 13 years in power. His government rejects the accusations.\n\n(Reporting by Krisztina Than; Editing by Timothy Heritage and Gareth Jones)"}

It's the kind of obstruction of key policy objectives for which Orb\u00e1n has become notorious within the European Union.\n\n\u201cWe are the sand in the machinery, the stick between the spokes, the splinter under the fingernail,\u201d Orb\u00e1n said in a speech to tens of thousands of supporters in 2021.\n\nThat \u201cstick between the spokes\u201d tactic, and Orb\u00e1n's role as Europe's perennial spoiler, has brought the EU to breaking point time and again as he has blocked crucial decisions to leverage concessions from the bloc, forcing its leaders to scramble to find workarounds.\n\nNow, frustrated EU officials are trying to determine what Orb\u00e1n seeks to achieve with his obstructionist strategy, and how they might overcome it.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\n\"We have Orb\u00e1n fatigue now in Brussels,\u201d Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters ahead of an EU summit on Thursday, where the Hungarian leader threatened to derail plans to provide Ukraine with a major funding package. \u201cI can\u2019t understand, I can\u2019t accept this very strange and very egoistic game of Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\u201d\n\nA proponent of an alternative form of populist governance that he calls \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d Orb\u00e1n campaigns against the EU at home, portraying himself as a \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d against an overzealous Brussels bureaucracy.\n\nHas railed against what he describes as \u201cwoke culture,\u201d and in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Budapest last year, referred to liberalism as a \u201cvirus.\u201d\n\nIt has long been conventional wisdom within the EU that Orb\u00e1n's intransigence is purely transactional: that he is holding up key decisions as a way to force the bloc into releasing billions in funding that it has withheld from Hungary over alleged breaches of rule-of-law and democracy standards.\n\nBut P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3, director of the Budapest-based think tank Political Capital, said that while securing the funds is important to Orb\u00e1n to shore up Hungary's ailing economy, Europe's longest-serving leader is motivated by more than just cash.\n\n\u201cI think we have to abandon this idea that there is only one single reason that explains all this,\u201d Krek\u00f3 said. \u201cOrb\u00e1n is also doing it for recognition. He can meet with and talk to the most important leaders of the European Union.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as leader of a country with fewer than 10 million inhabitants, Orb\u00e1n has successfully used his veto power in the EU to give Hungary a decisive voice among much larger members like Germany, France and Italy.\n\nBy Orb\u00e1n's own admission, the need for unanimous support for some EU policy decisions is the only tool that a small country like Hungary can use to assert its will among the greater powers.\n\n\u201cHungary sees unanimous decision-making as the last guarantee of the protection of its national interests,\u201d he said in November.\n\nDaniel Freund, a German member of the Green party and lawmaker in the European Parliament, said Orb\u00e1n's serial blocking of crucial EU decisions shows that his veto power has given him influence within the bloc that endangers its very ability to function.\n\nUnanimity, Freund said, is \u201cbecoming a tool for blackmail and extortion, and it\u2019s actually a huge security risk\u201d which has allowed Orb\u00e1n to undermine EU unity on issues from support for Ukraine to NATO expansion.\n\nOn Thursday, leaders from the EU's 27 nations gathered in Brussels to try, for a second time, to pass a crucial $54 million financial aid package to Ukraine, a summit that Orb\u00e1n forced by vetoing the aid in December.\n\nOrb\u00e1n lifted his veto shortly after the summit began, bowing to pressure from leaders of Europe's larger nations. Ukraine would get its money, and a crisis was averted.\n\nBut with his veto power, the nationalist leader will have plenty of further opportunities to sow discord within the EU. He has opposed a 5-billion euro ($5.4 billion) weapons fund for Kyiv and warned that he's prepared to \u201c slam the brakes \u201d on Ukraine's path toward joining the bloc.\n\nHis government has also dragged its feet on approving Sweden's NATO accession, and is the only member of the alliance not to have ratified its bid.\n\nOrb\u00e1n's conduct has gained him admirers among like-minded nationalists in Europe and the United States who are hostile toward the Brussels and Washington approach to issues like immigration, LGBTQ+ rights and Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nHe has endorsed Donald Trump in each of his runs for the U.S. presidency, and is hoping for a Trump victory over President Joe Biden in elections in November.\n\nAs the EU prepares for its own elections in June, Orb\u00e1n is angling to take a leading role in a burgeoning anti-EU movement of conservative forces across the continent, and hopes a right-wing shift will bring his ideas into the mainstream, said Freund, the EU lawmaker.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to position himself as the leader of the anti-European camp,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has the impression that the far right is on the rise, that this is all going his way and he\u2019s basically just waiting for it to fully happen.\u201d\n\nThere are signs that Orb\u00e1n\u2019s hopes for a right-wing resurgence could come to fruition as polls show euroskeptic parties surging.\n\nAn anti-Islam populist and Orb\u00e1n ally won elections in the Netherlands in November, while the far-right Alternative for Germany party has risen to second place in national polls behind Berlin's mainstream conservative opposition.\n\nKrek\u00f3, of Political Capital, said that Orb\u00e1n is seeking to \u201cweaken\u201d EU institutions that have gotten in his way by pressuring Hungary to crack down on corruption, restore judicial independence and respect LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n\"He\u2019s very clear about his antagonism towards the European institutional system and he would be happy with a European Union that does nothing more than free trade \u2014 plus, of course, structural funds coming to Hungary,\u201d Krek\u00f3 said.\n\nWidely considered to be Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest ally in the EU, Orb\u00e1n has been accused by his critics of promoting Moscow\u2019s interests over those of his EU and NATO allies, and of preparing to lead his country out of the EU entirely.\n\nBut in an interview in December, Orb\u00e1n denied he planned to take such a step.\n\n\u201cMy plan is not to leave Brussels, but to take it over,\u201d he said."}

The white-walled apartment was sparsely furnished and the video appeared to show only a pair of shoes on a bedside table and a kettle next to the kitchen sink.\n\n00:00:33 Police search Newcastle flat during manhunt for Abdul Ezedi \u2013 video\n\nCommander Jon Savell of the Met said the investigation to locate Ezedi was \u201ccontinuing at pace\u201d and thanked people who had contacted officers.\n\n\u201cWe have received dozens of calls with information, including possible sightings, and every single piece of information has been recorded and forms part of our investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficers would use \u201cevery available tool and tactic for as long as it takes\u201d to find Ezedi, he added, and urged the public to remain vigilant and contact police immediately if they saw Ezedi, without approaching him.\n\nThe 31-year-old woman, who Sky News reported had been in a relationship with Ezedi, remained in hospital on Saturday and police described her condition as \u201ccritical but stable\u201d after suffering burns from an alkaline substance. Her daughters, aged three and eight, were also injured in the attack, although their injuries are not as serious as first thought, police said. Nine other people also suffered injuries while helping the victims.\n\nEzedi, is a 35-year-old Afghan, who officials say arrived in the UK in 2016 in a lorry. He was given a suspended sentence after being convicted of sexual assault and exposure in 2018. By 2022 he had been granted refugee status after two failed attempts, apparently on the basis that he had converted to Christianity. Conservative MPs have called for an investigation into how he was given asylum.\n\nEzedi\u2019s brother Hassan told the Sun newspaper he would hand in his elder sibling if he knew where he was.\n\nPolice in London and Newcastle have established that Ezedi\u2019s car was in Newcastle shortly after midnight on Wednesday. Six-and-a-half hours later, the car was seen in Tooting, south London.\n\nLater that afternoon, the car was sighted in Croydon, and then he was seen driving it in Streatham at 7pm.\n\nIt is about a 10-minute drive from there to Lessar Avenue in Clapham where the attack took place. The street is opposite Clapham Common, a mixture of expensive Victorian houses and mansion flats built after the blitz. Residents were roused by sounds of shouting and a car smashing into other parked vehicles. One said they heard a woman shouting \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to work, leave me alone.\u201d\n\nAs it became clear that the 31-year-old woman and her children had been attacked, people rushed to help, including Shannon Christi, a bus driver.\n\n\u201cAs I run outside I\u2019ve seen this guy throwing a child on the floor,\u201d she told the Press Association. \u201cHe picked her up and threw her again. So at that point I ran in and I grabbed her and took her into my block.\u201d\n\nWitnesses said a child had run to a white car, allegedly Ezedi\u2019s, and had been banging on the door before the youngster was attacked. Christi saw the 31-year-old woman walking along the road saying \u201cI can\u2019t see\u201d.\n\nOthers said they believed she had been attacked with pepper spray, but it soon became clear that another more corrosive substance had been used, as bystanders were also harmed.\n\nStaff from the nearby Dudley Hotel came to help with towels and water.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s alleged Ezedi abandoned his car and fled. \u201cHe ran off towards the common,\u201d said Oliver Whale, who lives in one of the mansion blocks nearby and didn\u2019t see the initial commotion. \u201cI think two people chased him but they lost him. One was wearing slippers I think.\u201d But the pursuers lost the man alleged to be Ezedi in the darkness.\n\nAccording to police, the woman was attacked at 7.25pm and it is alleged that by 7.33pm Ezedi had made his way to Clapham South station, at the corner of the common, and got on a Northern line train.\n\nHe arrived at King\u2019s Cross station and left again just before 8pm. What he did for the next 45 minutes is unclear, but at 8.42pm security cameras at a Tesco Express in Caledonian Road recorded him in the store, carrying a large bottle of water.\n\nThe images released by the Met show him with an apparently serious injury to his right eye and cheek, consistent with a chemical burn.\n\nAnywhere else, he would have stood out, but King\u2019s Cross is busy in the evenings and locals describe that end of Cally Road as \u201cold King\u2019s Cross\u201d. \u201cThere are so many misfits around here that he would have fit right in,\u201d said one business owner.\n\nGurpal Kaur, a local, was in the area that evening. \u201cIt\u2019s quite busy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many pubs and stuff around here. Most days there\u2019s loads of people around.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been here. You just don\u2019t know who you can trust \u2013 people are so narcissistic and wicked.\u201d\n\nEzedi walked back from the shop towards the train station, probably crossing the crowded piazza in front of the overground station and going back on the underground. Further CCTV footage released by police shows him wearing a blue high-tech T-shirt and carrying a black jacket, his injuries clearly visible.\n\nEzedi was last seen getting on a Victoria line train going south. After that, the trail has gone cold."}

Its plans for a complete overhaul of social care will, however, be presented as a longer-term mission taking at least 10 years and two parliaments.\n\nIn addition, despite Keir Starmer\u2019s previous promises to abolish the Lords in a first term, it is expected to commit only to limited changes. This is likely to mean legislating only for the abolition of the remaining 91 hereditary peers.\n\nLabour\u2019s cautious approach \u2013 which is frustrating some MPs and party members \u2013 is partly the result of uncertainty about the economic situation it will inherit and what can be afforded.\n\nBut shadow ministers are also determined to offer as small a target as possible to the Tories on issues such as social care, which in the past have turned election campaigns upside down. In 2010, Labour\u2019s care plans were branded a \u201cdeath tax\u201d by the Conservatives, and hit the party\u2019s vote badly, while in 2017 Theresa May\u2019s campaign suffered irreparable damage amid accusations she was planning a \u201cdementia tax\u201d.\n\nOn social care, Starmer\u2019s party has rallied the unions behind its more gradual approach. Unison\u2019s general secretary, Christina McAnea, told the Observer: \u201cCare is in crisis and the need for a national service has never been greater. But the sector is complex and, with many thousands of care employers, creating a new system isn\u2019t a five-minute job.\n\n\u201cIn stark contrast to the litany of broken promises from this government, Labour is committed to reforming care. Under the proposed fair pay agreement, wages will rise and care workers earn the same no matter where they work in England.\n\n\u201cCare jobs will immediately become more attractive, and the sector be able to start filling the huge hole in its workforce. That will boost support to everyone needing care and begin to lift the pressure on the NHS.\u201d\n\nWith its green prosperity plan now being talked down, Labour\u2019s new \u201cflagship\u201d policy is increasingly seen as its new deal for working people, which involves handing workers new rights from their first day of employment, as well as the abolition of zero-hours contracts. The deal, fiercely guarded by deputy leader Angela Rayner, also includes a ban on \u201cfiring and rehiring\u201d.\n\nAnother bill that is likely to be prioritised will be a \u201cfiscal lock\u201d that will force government to submit all tax and spending plans to the Office for Budget Responsibility for its judgment before pressing ahead.\n\nThe aim is to contrast Labour\u2019s commitment to fiscal discipline with the disastrous decision-making of the Liz Truss government, which caused near panic on financial markets.\n\nElsewhere, Labour\u2019s pledge to roll out breakfast clubs to every primary school in England, funded by the abolition of non-dom tax status, remains prominent in the manifesto.\n\nThere are also hopes internally that a big childcare pledge could form part of Labour\u2019s programme in a first term, with the party keen on expanding the number of nurseries attached to primary schools to tackle a huge shortage of places and staff. The former Ofsted head, Sir David Bell, is studying the issue for Labour, but is unlikely to report in time for an election before the autumn.\n\nThe party\u2019s pledge to raise more tax from private equity managers has also come in for scrutiny. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has vowed to raise the amount charged on profits they earn on deals, to match the 45p top rate of income tax. However, some in the party are said to be keen to water down the plan, fearful of deterring investment and denting Labour\u2019s pledge to make the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7 group of developed countries. Party sources insisted the plan remained to tax such profits as income.\n\nThe manifesto will also make much of a pledge to build 300,000 homes a year \u2013 a target in the last Conservative manifesto that has not been achieved. Starmer\u2019s willingness to take on those who want to prevent any building on \u201cgreenfield\u201d sites is used by Labour insiders to show the Labour leader is willing to take on potentially difficult battles, rather than always take a cautious path."}

Here was yet another extraordinary display of breathless drama and skill in a sport seemingly overflowing with them.\n\nIt appeared Scotland had that historic victory in the bag within 40 minutes, very definitely within 43, by which time they had opened up a 27-0 lead, having obliterated their inexperienced hosts, for whom absolutely nothing was going according to plan. Then, as if a flick had been switched, the Welsh kids threw caution to the wind. And, boyo, it appears they can play when they want to.\n\nHaving not been able to win lineout ball for love nor money in the opening half, they executed a sweet lineout and drive five minutes after that deficit had been established, for James Botham, son of Liam, grandson of Ian, to score. A murmur in the dumbstruck crowd.\n\nThat was just the first stirring. Five minutes later again, Wales were hammering at Scotland\u2019s defence, by now reduced to 14 following George Turner\u2019s yellow card. Tomos Williams, a half-time replacement, looped round Nick Tompkins to send Rio Dyer over out wide. More than a stirring now \u2013 a full-on riot. And seemingly nothing now could stop Wales winning ball and making ground. Scotland would not be awarded a single penalty in the entirety of the second half; Wales had 14 of them in a row.\n\nOn the hour, Sione Tuipulotu was shown Scotland\u2019s second yellow, as the wave after wave of ravenous youngsters in red hammered at their line. Another tapped penalty and the magnificent Aaron Wainwright was over. Ioan Lloyd, on in the first half for his even younger fly-half comrade, Sam Costelow, landed his second conversion to pull Wales back to within eight.\n\nThen the registering of the two bonus points they would end up with, courtesy of Wales\u2019s fourth. Cameron Winnett, looking great on debut, combined with Dyer to cause havoc down the left. Another penalty, another lineout and drive \u2013 try for Alex Mann, another debutant. Ten full minutes to complete the job, the stadium was its traditional inferno now, the kids inspired.\n\nBut kids is what they are. That was as far as they could go. They lost their first lineout in those final 10 minutes. And so it was to Scotland to press at the end, in search of a bonus point of their own, but Duhan van der Merwe was denied his third try at the death by a prone Welsh leg. Scotland did not quibble.\n\nWales, meanwhile, had ridden seeming indignity to announce maybe the start of a new era. They had nothing to lose in the second half, it is true, but these deficits need overhauling \u2013 and Scotland were more than ruffled by the end.\n\nReceived wisdom had it that a good start was essential for this young Welsh team. Well, the cold reality could not have turned out more differently. Wales turned around 20-0 down, completely outplayed and with Costelow off with a head injury.\n\nView image in fullscreen Alex Mann scores Wales\u2019 fourth try as they gave Scotland an almighty scare. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nOpposite him, Scotland\u2019s captain had seemed to announce almost immediately he was in one of those moods. Finn Russell had the ball on a string in that half, whether off hand or boot. For Scotland\u2019s second try, on the half-hour, he flummoxed the youngster opposite with a show and go to send Van der Merwe over for his first.\n\nWinnett looked confident at full-back, but Scotland\u2019s new boy in the 15 shirt, Kyle Rowe, had the run of the place early on, linking with his namesake Steyn on the wing at will. All of which is much easier when you have oodles of ball to work with.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Breakdown Free weekly newsletter The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The full-back found Kyle Steyn on the right, who cut hard inside to within a few yards. A couple of robust carries later, Pierre Schoeman forced his way over the line for a 10-0 lead in almost as many minutes.\n\nAs experienced a player as Josh Adams was next to have a brain fade, when he threw the ball into the crowd after Russell had landed a 50-22. The punishment was a further three points, before that second try created the 20-point lead at half-time. Scotland stole another lineout, Russell sprayed more kicks to his outside backs, the two Kyles making hay down the right, before Russell executed that loop round Tuipulotu to send Van der Merwe to the posts.\n\nWarren Gatland brought on three players at the break, but the initial impact was limited.

One of the fires was threatening the coastal resort town of Vi\u00f1a del Mar, where some neighbourhoods have already been badly affected.\n\nView image in fullscreen The aftermath of wildfire in Vina del Mar, Chile, seen on 3 February.

Burnt-out cars with broken windows lined the streets, which were covered in ashes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here 32 years and never imagined this would happen,\u201d said Rolando Fern\u00e1ndez, one of the people who lost his home. He said he first saw the fire burning on a nearby hill on Friday afternoon. Within 15 minutes the area was engulfed in flames and smoke, forcing everyone to run for their lives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked my whole life, and now I\u2019m left with nothing,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Vina del Mar, Chile on 3 February.

Rescue teams were still struggling to reach the most affected areas, she said.\n\nThe fires are burning on mountains that are hard to reach and have affected neighbourhoods that were built precariously on the edge of Vi\u00f1a del Mar.\n\nOfficials have also reported blackouts as a result of the fire. Toh\u00e1 said that in the region of Valpara\u00edso, four hospitals had to be evacuated as well as three nursing homes. The fire also destroyed two bus terminals.\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern has caused droughts and hotter-than-usual temperatures along the west of South America this year, increasing the risk of forest fires. In January, more than 17,000 hectares (42,000 acres) of forests were destroyed in Colombia by fires that followed several weeks of dry weather."}

We must make power-sharing work because collectively, we are charged with leading and delivering for all our people, for every community.\u201d\n\nThe appointment of a republican first minister represented \u201ca new dawn\u201d unimaginable to past generations of Catholics who experienced discrimination, said O\u2019Neill, 47. \u201cThat state is now gone.\u201d\n\nFor all the conciliatory words, the County Tyrone republican comes from an IRA family, defends the legitimacy of IRA violence and honours IRA members. She tacitly disputes Northern Ireland\u2019s legitimacy by referring to it as the \u201cnorth of Ireland\u201d.\n\nStormont\u2019s architects represented the six counties by building six floors and erecting six pillars, all mounted on a granite base, but Sinn Fein, ascendant north and south of the border, has its eyes on all 32 counties.\n\nO\u2019Neill will lead the executive with Emma Little-Pengelly, a Democratic Unionist (DUP) who was nominated deputy first minister, a post with equal power but less prestige.\n\nLittle-Pengelly, 44, recalled witnessing the aftermath of an IRA bomb as a girl but vowed to work with O\u2019Neill to improve public services. \u201cMichelle is an Irish republican, and I am a very proud unionist. We will never agree on those issues, but what we can agree on is that cancer doesn\u2019t discriminate and our hospitals need to be fixed. Let us be a source of hope to those young people watching today, not one of despair.\u201d\n\nSeveral unionist assembly members congratulated O\u2019Neill but others wore funereal expressions that betrayed the psychological blow - a state designed in 1921 to enshrine a permanent unionist majority, with a Protestant assembly for a Protestant people, was no more.\n\nDemographic and political changes eroded that hegemony, and at the 2022 assembly election Sinn F\u00e9in overtook the DUP as the biggest party. A DUP boycott in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements mothballed Stormont until this past week when the UK government tweaked the Windsor framework and smoothed the so-called Irish Sea border.\n\nThe secretary of state, Chris Heaton-Harris, called it a great day for Northern Ireland and expressed optimism Stormont will break a stop-start cycle that has plagued it since the 1998 Good Friday agreement ushered in mandatory power-sharing.\n\nDuring the second world war Stormont was daubed with cow manure to camouflage it from German bombers. Jim Allister of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice suggested the place still stank. \u201cWe have a Sinn F\u00e9in first minister, but not in my name, nor in the name of thousands of unionists who will never bow the knee to IRA-Sinn F\u00e9in,\u201d he said.\n\nAllister accused the DUP of selling out and said Northern Ireland remained under EU customs rules, weakening its position in the UK.\n\nRumoured loyalist protests at Stormont, an estate outside Belfast, failed to materialise. Instead health and transport workers brought banners to denounce crumbling public services and delayed pay rises.\n\nThe assembly\u2019s revival will unlock a \u00a33.3bn financial package from London that should be enough to avert planned strikes but not solve a fiscal crisis worsened by two years of stalemate.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in, the DUP, Alliance and the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) shared ministerial positions using the D\u2019Hondt mechanism based on party strengths, except for justice, which Alliance leader Naomi Long filled on a cross-community vote.\n\nSinn Fein nominated Conor Murphy as economy minister, John O\u2019Dowd as infrastructure minister and Caoimhe Archibald as finance minister. The DUP nominated Paul Givan to education and Gordon Lyons to communities. Robin Swann of the UUP regained the health portfolio and Alliance\u2019s Andrew Muir took agriculture, the environment and rural affairs.\n\nEdwin Poots, a former DUP leader, became assembly speaker.\n\nMatthew O\u2019Toole leads the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP), which failed to qualify for the executive, as the opposition. His first act was to ask the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in to commit to not walking out. \u201cIf we are to achieve anything we cannot continue with the threat of collapse looming over Stormont,\u201d he said."}

I was with three travel-weary friends who were hitchhiking to a small fishing village for an epic reunion of travellers who had met at Oktoberfest in Munich the month before, and had agreed to meet up again in Calpe.\n\nAs we stood under the Spanish sun, a black car pulled up. Inside was this strangely dressed guy in a beach hat with a charming smile. He asked where we were headed and when we mentioned the reunion, he said: \u201cHi, I\u2019m Philip. Hop in, I\u2019m heading there too.\u201d\n\nThere were three villas where all the travellers were staying \u2013 an American villa (where I was lodged with my London friends), a Canadian villa, and an Australian villa. Needless to say the Aussie villa was the wildest and most fun.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018At first I thought Philip was an unusual guy\u2019: Philip Townsend (left) and Linda McLauchlan (now Townsend, right) in Calpe 1971. Composite: supplied\n\nLife in Calpe was picnic excursions to the countryside, beach volleyball, dinners at various villas, and some very wild parties. I remember at one such gathering, Philip and a friend went to the local bodega and spent all our contributions on as much alcohol as they could find. That evening, they mixed up a giant tub of sangria with every form of alcohol imaginable, topped off with some chunks of fruit. I remember remarking that it looked potent; they said it was \u201cjust a fruit drink\u201d.\n\nBy dawn, there were bodies collapsed on the lawn, people honking into bushes and heaving out of windows. Some fruit drink!\n\nAt first I thought Philip was an unusual guy. He wore shoes that were too big and flipped open at the end so his toes hung out, and a long, oversized coat.\n\nAs I held his hand in mine, it felt strong but gentle and safe.\n\nOne night at a party at the Australian villa, I was reading palms when Philip flicked his open hand over my shoulder and said, \u201cRead mine, Rhodesiac\u201d (I was from Rhodesia, which is now Zimbabwe). He was wearing his striped towelling hat and flamboyant pink board shorts covered in fish (his mum made them from old curtains).\n\nAs I held his hand in mine, it felt strong but gentle and safe. He was stunned by what I sensed on his palm \u2013 a few skeletons in the closet from his past. He anxiously asked me if his best friend had divulged something; to which I replied: \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d\n\nWhile holding his hand, I had this sixth sense that this would be the hand that would hold my babies. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time and only brought it up a few years later when we were married. I have never forgotten it.\n\nIt was Franco\u2019s Spain, and the beautiful young people were warned not to go on the beach at night for fear of being shot. So at night we stuck to our villas and partied on. Some days I felt the need to be alone and escape from all the madness and personalities and would head off to a small beach hotel for afternoon tea. Philip would often sing out, \u201cRhodesiac, can I come too?\u201d We would sit and drink tea, gazing at the Mediterranean. I was getting fonder and fonder of this guy who seemed to understand my black moods.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018We are now travelling the globe together in our golden years\u2019: Philip and Linda Townsend in Calpe in 2012. Photograph: Supplied\n\nFriends said that there was electricity between us. Every time I turned around his big green eyes were riveted on mine. It was the happiest I have ever felt.\n\nThen, Philip headed to Italy and Greece with his friends, and life in Calpe became dull.\n\nThe next time we met was at a party in London, and this was where we really fell in love.\n\nSadly, I had to return to war-torn Rhodesia and my family. A couple of months later, Philip arrived and we were married beneath a southern African sky.\n\nMore than 50 years and four beautiful children later, we are now travelling the globe together in our golden years. The one thing we\u2019ve always had in common is our passion for travel. I believe meeting Philip was kismet. Destiny. I\u2019m so grateful our two stars crossed paths.\n\n***\n\nIs there a moment you knew?"}

But the little boy does not want to die. Under the cover of night, he escapes the house and hides in the forest, where he watches as the troops round up the inhabitants. From his hiding place among the snow-covered trees, Alex Kurzem \u2013 a name he did not go by then \u2013 watches as his entire family is massacred.\n\nThe boy survives in the Belarus forest, enduring sub-zero temperatures for an unknown number of days, maybe weeks. He forages for food among the strewn abandoned corpses. At night, he ties himself to the high boughs of trees to protect himself from wolves.\n\nKurzem\u2019s story, which becomes even more extraordinary as it progresses, first became public in the 1990s, was published as a bestselling book in 2007, then accused of being a Holocaust hoax in 2012. The former TV repair man, by then retired and eking out a life on the poverty line in a Melbourne suburb, stood by his story for decades.\n\nNow a new documentary, debuting on SBS on 8 February, delves into the story of how a little Jewish boy could have possibly become \u201cHitler\u2019s Jewish soldier\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Alex Kurzem in uniform. Photograph: SBS\n\nReturning to the Belarusian wilds, 1942: the emaciated boy is eventually captured by a patrolling soldier from a Latvian police battalion, one of the many paramilitary outfits acting as Hitler\u2019s local Nazi SS enforcers in German-occupied Belarus. He is taken back to the battalion\u2019s base, where it is decided he will be referred to as a \u201cRussian orphan\u201d and become their mascot. A miniature uniform is sewn for his tiny frame and he is supplied with a sawn off shotgun. He is given a new name \u2013 Uldis Kurzemnieks \u2013 and a new birthday: 18 November, Latvia\u2019s day of independence.\n\nOver the following two years he remains attached to the regiment, witnessing murder and atrocities committed against Jewish people and captured partisans. Throughout these years, the blond blue-eyed boy does as one of his early captors advised: he keeps his own Jewish identity secret.\n\n\u201cInside I was crying rivers of tears,\u201d Kurzem later remembered, recalling clapping and laughing with the grownup soldiers as he witnessed a young Jewish boy being tortured to death. But, casting his memory back to his fight for survival in the Belarus forest, he said: \u201cI would have gone with the devil if he had taken me by the hand.\u201d\n\nAs the war progresses, the battalion is absorbed into the Third Reich\u2019s Waffen-SS. When Soviet troops begin to regain ground from Germany in occupied Estonia and Latvia in 1944, the boy is billeted for his own protection with the middle-class family of Riga factory owner, Jekabs Dzenis. The Dzenis family adopts him and, in 1949, they migrate to Melbourne together.\n\nAll the teenage Kurzem brings with him to Australia is his fake identity, a tattered leather suitcase \u2013 the contents of which would remain hidden for decades \u2013 and a deeply scarred psyche.\n\nDan Goldberg, the film-maker behind Hitler\u2019s Jewish Soldier?, first got to know Kurzem when he was the editor of the Australian Jewish News 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cHe was a highly traumatised individual and he was living in borderline poverty,\u201d Goldberg says. \u201cHe had shut off his memories of the war for 50 years and kept it a secret. When he finally started telling his story, he was met with resistance from both sides. He had been living his life as a Latvian in Melbourne, and when he revealed his Jewishness, he was accused of being a fraud by both the Jewish community and the Latvian community. I think it was incredibly hard for him to take.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Kurzem\u2019s eldest son Mark published the story of his father\u2019s life as a bestselling memoir titled The Mascot. Crucial to The Mascot\u2019s narrative were two sepia photographs of a little blond boy dressed in a Latvian SS uniform, photographs that Kurzem had secreted away in that battered suitcase for decades.\n\nThe book attracted international attention. There was talk of a Hollywood film deal; Anthony Hopkins and Robin Williams\u2019 names were tossed about. But Maris Lakis, a descendant of the Dzenis family, was furious that they were portrayed as being well-to-do Nazi supporters prior to migrating to Australia. He demanded Penguin pulp the book \u2013 but it was published anyway.\n\nLakis was raised regarding Kurzem \u2013 who he knew as Uldis \u2013 as a kindly adoptive uncle. In the film he alleges that Mark, who has since died, had \u201cembellished a highly false story\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Five Great Reads Free weekly newsletter Each week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Photograph: SBS\n\nIn 2009 60 Minutes in the US ran a story on The Mascot. Watching at home in Los Angeles, alarm bells rang for the US academic Dr Barry Resnick, himself a descendant of Holocaust victims.\n\nTogether with the US forensic genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick, who had exposed a number of previous Holocaust hoaxes, the pair set out to prove whether Kurzem\u2019s story was false.\n\nMuch of Goldberg\u2019s documentary deals with the pull and tug on both sides. A Belarusian family previously believed to be related to Kurzem are later found to not be related to him at all. Kurzem, for many years, stubbornly refuses to take a DNA test for reasons that aren\u2019t ever clear.\n\nIt is not until a Nazi propaganda reel from 1943 resurfaces, showing footage of a boy referred to as \u201cthe mascot\u201d, playing with Aryan children. Further research uncovers records of a massacre that took place in 1942 in the Belarus village of Koidanov \u2013 one of only two Belarusian words Kurzem was able to recall as an adult.\n\nAnd then: the diary of a soldier in the 18th Kurzeme Police Battalion, held by Stanford University, is examined. On 12 July 1942, the soldier records, his battalion picked up a \u201cfoster son whose parents are unknown\u201d. The boy was given the name Uldis Kurzemnieks.\n\nView image in fullscreen Alex Kurzem during his time as a TV repairman in Melbourne. Photograph: SBS\n\nGoldberg concedes that there are still many unanswered questions surrounding the enigmatic Alex Kurzem. How did such a little boy manage hide his Jewish identity? Why did Kurzem refuse to take a DNA test for so many years? He did finally do one in 2019 \u2013 and the test revealed that he was 100% Ashkenazi Jew and had living relatives.\n\nAn answer to the latter question could very well be undiagnosed PTSD. \u201cI still feel like I\u2019m two persons in one body, and they\u2019re not getting along very well,\u201d Kurzem once told a family member.\n\n\u201cI think what we can say with certainty is that the essence of Alex\u2019s story is true,\u201d Goldberg says. \u201cThe final irony was that he survived the horror of the Holocaust \u2013 and was felled by the scourge of Covid.\u201d\n\nAlex Kurzem died of complications from Covid-19 on 31 January 2021."}

The illustrious referees for his first academic job in the 1970s were Eric Hobsbawm and EP Thompson. In his 70s, Joyce has found a new non-academic audience combining memoir and history. His new book, Remembering Peasants: A Personal History of a Vanished World, follows in the footsteps of Going to My Father\u2019s House, which looked at themes of emigration, home and war. Joyce lives in Broadbottom, a former mill village on the edge of the Peak District.\n\nIn your book, you describe the world of European peasants as one that is disappearing. In France, which you write was \u201conce the greatest peasant country in Europe\u201d, only about 3% of the population now work in agriculture. What made you embark on this project of remembrance and commemoration?\n\nIt came partly out of the sense of respect for one\u2019s own \u2013 my grandparents lived this life, and my parents were born into this world before emigrating from Ireland to England. But also out of a recognition that the history of peasants is one of their silence or being silenced. People speak on their behalf; they very seldom speak on their own. These people have been misunderstood and degraded in so many historical accounts. And they\u2019ve also been falsely glorified by 20th-century communism, fascism and nationalism as some kind of elemental force in the universe. I was an insider to the peasant world. I knew something about it.\n\nWhat can we learn from their world, if we take the time to try to understand it?\n\nThere is a way of life there that is of extraordinary value to us. These are people who know they cannot bend the world to their will. People who recognise the limits of their knowledge. Peasants have an instinctive recognition that things are finite, that we cannot drive forever towards unlimited increase. They are outside the capitalist world in that way. They live within a horizon of necessity that we no longer inhabit, although the environmental crisis tells us we may have to inhabit it again. They\u2019re survivors, as we may have to learn to be.\n\nWhat else can one feel but sadness when looking at the 20th century?\n\nYou also describe being struck by how, in peasant communities, there is an underlying sense of solidarity, one of people and nature both.\n\nWe often want to stand outside nature and admire it; we want to be enchanted by it. For peasants, nature is not a beautiful thing; it harbours evil, unpredictable forces. You have to show your solidarity with it \u2013 and that includes the people and animals alongside you and the system you are bound into. It\u2019s about the creation of order in a world that is deeply subject to disorder, because of the vagaries of the seasons, famine and the social cleavages that sometimes threatened to tear peasant societies apart. This is a deeply binding order. In the book I dialogue with the spirit of Seamus Heaney on this \u2013 he talks about the origin of the word religion in the Latin, religare, meaning to bind. The natural, spiritual and divine constantly overlap in peasant culture and represent a sort of binding to the universe.\n\nWhat do you make of the current farmers\u2019 protests in Europe? Are these the successors to the old peasants, also misunderstood and condescended to?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to glorify them, because in south-east Poland, for example \u2013 where I visited last year \u2013 these are the people behind Law and Justice [the radical right nationalist party]. But then again, that was because that party gave them some respect, so the left has lessons to learn. But the modern marginalised are so often the migrants, and so often they are modern peasants \u2013 the Moroccans, Albanians and Tunisians who come to work the land in Europe and are frequently exploited. As migrants they live on the periphery. It goes through the same cycle as my parents.\n\nLike Going to My Father\u2019s House, the book includes very moving elements of memoir. Has combining the personal and the historical opened up new avenues for you, making your work more accessible?\n\nI\u2019ve spent my life as an academic, but now I seem to have a second career in my late 70s. It\u2019s weird, but good, exhausting though as one ages. Here I am doing an interview with the august Observer! I always felt I could write, when I got into the more detailed phase of the historical work, but in writing this and Going to My Father\u2019s House, I let certain guiding spirits take over, like WG Sebald in the latter. The influence might be at several removes but it\u2019s there, partly in the melancholy as well.\n\nDo you think of yourself as a melancholy writer?\n\nThe melancholic is a literary mode which may or may not involve melancholy of mind. I keep busy and am incubating a new book on the history of our sense of time and changing meanings of the past since 1945. What else but sadness can one feel when looking at the 20th century?\n\nWhat was the first book you fell in love with?\n\nI wasn\u2019t brought up in a house with books, so it was comics mainly. There were a few books. You read the stuff of the day, what was in the public library \u2013 John Steinbeck, John O\u2019Hara. One thing I did love as a child was the irrepressible Nigel Molesworth and Down With Skool! I relished Molesworth and the soppy Fotherington-Tomas \u2013 \u201cHullo clouds, hullo sky!\u201d Molesworth was a perpetual schoolboy in rebellion. I loved that.\n\nWhat are you reading now?\n\nI\u2019ve just finished Dermot Healy\u2019s book A Goat Song, which I was deeply impressed by. I love that generation of Irish writers, John McGahern among them. Healy\u2019s work is enormously ambitious. He is one of the greatest Irish novelists, though unacknowledged as such. I\u2019m also reading Annie Ernaux\u2019s story of her father: A Man\u2019s Place. Annie Ernaux\u2026 there\u2019s another way of doing the personal and the historical."}

Luton grace the Premier League and deserve to stay up; Ross Barkley is a thoroughly renascent central midfielder; and games such as this are the reason why England\u2019s top tier makes such a financial killing from overseas television rights.\n\nBy the end of an often chaotic, always compelling, afternoon, Eddie Howe\u2019s hopes of leading Newcastle on another European adventure next season were dented, Chiedozie Ogbene had delivered a masterclass in right-wing play and Barkley was celebrating another reaffirmation of an imperious talent many thought had faded for good.\n\nMeanwhile, Dan Burn had emphasised he is no longer the answer for Newcastle at left-back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, really difficult, to sum up my emotions,\u201d said Howe. \u201cThere were a lot of good things from us but a lot of bad too.\u201d\n\nSimilar sentiments were echoed by Rob Edwards. \u201cVery mixed emotions,\u201d said Luton\u2019s manager, whose side led 4-2 at one point. \u201cIt was a great game and I\u2019m proud of our performance. We were brave and could have won it at the end. But we\u2019re not the finished article and we\u2019re going to make mistakes. I felt sick at times, I felt elation at times but I think a point was a fair result.\u201d\n\nWith Alexander Isak having failed a late fitness test and Callum Wilson not yet ready for a full 90 minutes, Newcastle began without a recognised central striker. It did not prevent them from taking an early lead when Lewis Miley\u2019s gorgeous pass and Kieran Trippier\u2019s cross prefaced a fierce first-time shot unleashed by the on-\u00adrushing Sean Longstaff that evaded Thomas Kaminski\u2019s grasp.\n\nNot that Luton, buoyed up by Tuesday\u2019s 4-0 win against Brighton, were about to surrender. The visitors had started brightly with the exciting Ogbene repeatedly dodging Burn and they swiftly equalised when Barkley\u2019s floated free-kick was nodded back across goal, enabling Gabriel Osho to rise above all comers and head beyond Martin Dubravka.\n\nAs entertaining as Luton\u2019s set-piece specialists undeniably were, their high defensive line was often so high risk that Newcastle sensed opportunity. Sure enough, they quickly restored their lead when Anthony Gordon accelerated beyond that backline, showing Osho a clean pair of heels.\n\nView image in fullscreen Gabriel Osho scores Luton\u2019s first goal of a back-and-forth contest. Photograph: Bruce White/Colorsport/Shutterstock\n\nThe winger turned emergency central striker soon tested Kaminski with a shot the goalkeeper could merely parry, leaving it to bounce kindly into the advancing Longstaff\u2019s path. Cue another impressive finish. Not to mention a very passable impersonation of Frank Lampard in his prime from a midfielder harbouring hopes of an England call-up.\n\nUnwilling to be eclipsed, Barkley duly revelled in suggesting that life begins at 30 by not merely pulling plenty of strings from deep but scoring Luton\u2019s second equaliser. Appropriately, he began the move that concluded with him placing a shot into an empty net after the wrong-footed Dubravka could only parry Alfie Doughty\u2019s shot.\n\nUntil then, Elijah Adebayo, Luton\u2019s hat-trick hero against Brighton, had cut a relatively peripheral figure but the striker\u2019s clever decoy manoeuvre distracted the disappointing Sven Botman and co to the point where Barkley could pick his spot.\n\nHowe replaced the injured Gordon with Wilson at half-time but before he could make an impact Luton won a penalty awarded via a video assistant referee review after Burn hauled Ogbene back.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Displaying commendable poise, Morris converted again and, this time, the penalty counted.\n\nBurn\u2019s concession of possession then precipitated Barkley laying the ball off to Adebayo to sweep a shot into the bottom corner.\n\nQuick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

But over a three-month period, participants were allegedly subjected to methods near identical to those used by the religious movement.\n\nIn some cases they took part in the repetitive \u201cdrills\u201d for so long, while in vulnerable states due to their mental health or past substance use, that they would zone out, become paranoid or break down, according to corroborating testimony from people familiar with the programme. Participants were also allegedly left feeling suicidal and as though their minds had been \u201cshattered\u201d by the exercises \u2013 which often involved following commands such as \u201cstand up, sit down\u201d, or pointing at different objects. The drills could last up to five hours a day, for several weeks.\n\nNarconon said the drills, based on writings by L Ron Hubbard, Scientology\u2019s founder, were \u201cmentally strenuous\u201d and required discipline but had helped save lives. It said they were not a religious doctrine but had a \u201cpositive secular application\u201d.\n\nExperts and witnesses likened the methods to a form of obedience training. People working at the facility were also expected to complete the programme.\n\nThe allegations raise questions over how a rehab with links to one of the world\u2019s most controversial religious movements, accused of abusive practices, is able to operate unregulated in Britain.\n\nMarketed as \u201cworld class\u201d, and listed in an NHS directory, Narconon\u2019s Sussex facility, on a nine-acre campus near the town of Heathfield, opened in 2015. But it has not been inspected since 2016, and has never been assessed to ensure its programme is effective or safe. Instead, it has been operating without oversight for the last five years due to a regulation loophole, the Observer\u2019s investigation has found, and remains free of the same scrutiny that other addiction programmes face.\n\nWhile the Care Quality Commission (CQC) oversees substance misuse services, it says Narconon\u2019s programme is not within its remit and suggested this was because its approach was \u201calternative\u201d.\n\nIt said the service was not known to be providing any regulated activities and had been considered dormant since 2019.\n\nRecords released under freedom of information laws show that in that time, the watchdog has received 14 complaints which it did not formally investigate, saying it had no duty to do so. Despite this, Narconon continues to display a \u201cgood\u201d CQC rating on its website, from a prior inspection which assessed its accommodation, management and provision of personal care \u2013 but not the programme itself.\n\nDr David Bremner, medical director at addiction charity Turning Point, said the loophole showed the need for better regulation.

Its operations are supported by the Narconon Trust, which is principally funded by the International Association of Scientologists. Senior staff are members of the church.\n\nIn Scientology\u2019s \u201cauditing\u201d process, Scientologists complete exercises they believe will help them become spiritually enlightened. To learn the skills Scientology says are needed for auditing, followers take part in a series of drills known as \u201ctraining routines\u201d. These include following repetitive commands, sitting perfectly still or undergoing persistent questioning \u2013 closely resembling drills used at Narconon.\n\nProf Sally Marlow from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King\u2019s College London, said the approach did not sound therapeutic. \u201cIt is extremely concerning,\u201d she said.\n\nNarconon UK, the charity behind the facility, said its \u201cstudents\u201d were assessed by a GP before the programme, which also includes long sauna sessions, high doses of vitamins and costs about \u00a315,000. It said it was not a medical treatment and did not have patients, so did not need to be registered with the CQC as a substance misuse service. Sheila Maclean, Narconon UK\u2019s manager, said it was \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d that some people did \u201cnot get on\u201d with its methods but insisted they were safe. \u201cEven the best-run services have their critics,\u201d she said."}

Each year, a stream of people arrive at its gates, pass through neatly tended gardens and enter a grand white mansion, hoping to get \u201cdrug-free for good\u201d.\n\nThe charity that runs the facility, Narconon UK, says it is a world leader in tackling drug and alcohol misuse, claiming results superior to its rivals through a sauna detox, high vitamin doses and psychological exercises.\n\nIts credentials appear to stack up: Narconon is listed on the NHS \u00adwebsite, included in council \u00addirectories, and displays a \u201cgood\u201d rating from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in its marketing, alongside dozens of testimonials. \u201cNarconon gave me my life back,\u201d says one smiling client.\n\nBut behind the glossy image there is another side to the story. A nine-month investigation has \u00aduncovered allegations of safeguarding \u00adfailings and psychological abuse at Narconon\u2019s premises in Heathfield, East Sussex. It also suggests that \u2013 despite reassuring clients it is independent \u2013 the rehabilitation programme is more closely entwined with the controversial Church of Scientology than it lets on.\n\nIn interviews with the Observer, former patients and staff described how people seeking help were put through intensive \u00admental exercises \u2013 \u201cdrills\u201d \u2013 similar to methods used in Scientology\u2019s \u201cauditing\u201d process.\n\nIn some cases, they took part in these repetitive drills for so long, while in vulnerable states due to their mental health or prior drug use, that they would go into \u201chypnotic\u201d states, become paranoid or break down or suffer other extreme reactions. After taking part in the drills, which could last up to five hours a day for several weeks, others were \u00adallegedly left \u201ctraumatised\u201d, feeling suicidal, with their minds \u201cshattered\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Scientology headquarters in Los Angeles. Photograph: Leigh Green/Alamy\n\nOne former Narconon staff member, racked with guilt over their part in the operation, claimed they watched \u00adpeople \u201cbreak\u201d during exercises they likened to \u201cobedience training\u201d.\n\nThe allegations, and evidence gathered in undercover calls, also suggest clients were admitted to the rehab despite histories of mental illness and were misled about the extent of Scientology\u2019s influence. Yet despite attempts to raise the alarm \u2013 including 19 complaints to the CQC, the watchdog responsible for overseeing substance misuse services in England \u2013 the facility has not been inspected for eight years and has never been assessed to ensure it is safe. The regulator says Narconon\u2019s \u201calternative\u201d approach does not fall within its remit \u2013 so it has no duty to investigate. The Department of Health said it was a matter for the CQC.\n\nSo who is accountable for safeguarding vulnerable people at unregulated rehabs such as Narconon? And how can a facility accused of abuse, linked to one of the world\u2019s most controversial movements, have been allowed to operate for years, with no formal oversight at all?\n\nLaunched in the US in 1966, Narconon is billed as a \u201cholistic, non-medical and secular\u201d approach to rehabilitation. Its residential programme is based on the belief of L Ron Hubbard, Scientology\u2019s founder, that toxic drug residues lodge in the body long after use, creating a \u201cbiochemical barrier to spiritual well-being\u201d.\n\nTo remove them, patients complete a \u201cpurification rundown\u201d involving five-hour sauna sessions, treadmill exercise and high doses of vitamins. They later do psychological exercises and a course known as \u201clife skills\u201d. The goal is to achieve a \u201cclear body\u201d and a \u201cclear mind\u201d.\n\nHubbard\u2019s theories about drug residues are rejected by the scientific community, and addiction experts argue the methods are not evidence-based. But Narconon insists its approach is robust. It has 30 centres across the world offering help for substances including alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs, and claims to have saved tens of \u00adthousands of lives.\n\nView image in fullscreen An ex-participant at Narconon. This image has been manipulated to protect his identity Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer\n\nIn 2015, it announced an expansion of its UK operations with the opening of the 16-bed facility near Heathfield \u2013 about 20 miles from Scientology\u2019s HQ. In a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by local politicians, it said the centre marked a new era in UK drug treatment. \u201cWith the country suffering from a drug abuse epidemic, a new drug-free drug rehabilitation centre brings hope,\u201d it said.\n\nSince then, it has secured listings on luxury rehab websites and run online ad campaigns. Managers regularly post in Facebook groups for those trying to get clean. \u201cThe friendliest drug and alcohol rehab in the UK welcomes new programme participants in a safe and welcoming environment,\u201d read a recent post, followed by a \u00adsmiley emoji.\n\nThe programme typically lasts three to four months and costs about \u00a315,000. Many of those enrolling are not Scientologists.\n\nOften, they are drawn to Narconon\u2019s purported \u201cnatural\u201d approach. \u201cI\u2019d heard of the Priory and this just seemed, from what they were saying, more like a wellness, mental health-y type of place,\u201d one former client said.\n\nParts of the programme are strict. Patients \u2013 referred to as students \u2013 are expected to wear identical tracksuits, have regimented schedules and spend hours studying. As is common at some other rehabs, they also surrender their phones upon entry and cut off contact with the outside world, save for pre-approved calls or visits.\n\nThey had a duty of care to look after me but it messed me up badly. I came out significantly worse than when I went in anonymous patient\n\nDuring their first days, patients undergo a \u201cdrug free\u201d withdrawal, with massages (\u201cassists\u201d) and no medicines such as methadone to wean them off. They complete a five-week \u201cdetox\u201d, with up to five hours a day in a sauna, running on a \u00adtreadmill and taking a cocktail of vitamins.\n\nHubbard\u2019s book Clear Body, Clear Mind recommends the main ingredient, niacin, is taken in an initial dose of 100mg which increases to 5,000mg for those deemed fit to receive it \u2013 333 times the recommended daily amount.\n\nThe NHS says high doses of \u00adniacin can cause skin flushes and \u2013 over long periods \u2013 liver damage. The approach has previously been linked to reports of adverse reactions. Narconon said safety incidents were \u201cvery rare\u201d \u2013 and for most people, the detox does not seem harmful. One participant said this phase was \u201clike jail\u201d because you are \u201cleft alone with your thoughts,\u201d but that it enabled them to rest. Another said: \u201cThat first part, the detox, was kind of cool.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Some former participants described being left \u2018traumatised\u2019.\n\nDuring the next phase, the intensity ramps up. Participants take part in psychological drills which Narconon says are intended to \u201cground\u201d them in the present moment. \u201cThe aim is to help bring a person out of the past and into the present time \u2013 ready and able to face life without resorting to drugs,\u201d its website says.\n\nNine people with knowledge of Narconon\u2019s operations gave corroborating accounts of how participants were put in pairs and required to follow or give commands \u2013 touching or pointing to items, or standing up and sitting down \u2013 repeatedly.\n\nOne former staff member described this phase, known as The Objectives, as \u201cgruesome\u201d. \u201cThere are certain criteria the addicts need to reach, but you are not even told what they are. [They] can\u2019t tell you how long the session will last. It\u2019s just: touch that, touch that, touch that, touch that. It can be any inanimate object. Or it might be, \u2018Sit down, stand up.\u201d\n\nOther exercises required participants to sit perfectly still for prolonged periods, or saw them asked questions \u201cover and over again\u201d. \u201cI would even compare it at one point to enhanced interrogation techniques,\u201d said an ex-staff member. \u201cEach time you answer they ask the same question again and again until you give a different answer and they say, \u2018Why did you answer differently this time?\u2019 and then you have to come up with some revelation like, ah, I just realised: \u2018My whole life has been wrong.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo move on to the next stage, \u00ad\u201cstudents\u201d must meet \u00adcriteria \u2013 such as demonstrating equal response times between completing commands or having an epiphany unprompted about their behaviour or life. Sessions were monitored by a senior staff member \u2013 often Scientologists \u2013 who would ensure compliance and decide when the exercise was completed in line with Hubbard\u2019s writings, which ex-staff said were treated \u201clike the Bible\u201d.\n\nSometimes people would sometimes be stuck on stages \u201cfor days\u201d because they \u201cdidn\u2019t understand what they were expected to do\u201d, one person said. If participants asked questions, they got no reply. \u201cIt is ignored. There is no input whatsoever.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen L Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology. Photograph: Mondadori/Getty Images\n\nThe drills left some feeling \u201cdegraded\u201d and \u201cstuck\u201d. \u201cIt was like I had been chained. I can\u2019t leave the room. I can\u2019t answer the \u00adquestions. I can\u2019t not do the command. I can\u2019t make it end,\u201d one person said. While not physically restrained, they were strongly discouraged from leaving.\n\nOther times, participants became paranoid, anxious or acutely distressed. \u201cThey were clearly very unwell,\u201d a \u00adwitness said. \u201cI saw people yelling and screaming. Physical outbursts. Some people would laugh, others would cry.\u201d\n\nSeveral witnesses described how people would go into hypnotic or trance-like states, \u201cspacing out\u201d or experiencing \u201cdepersonalisation\u201d. \u201cThey taught me that usually you go through these exercises until you \u2026 get to a point where you feel that your body doesn\u2019t belong to you. You might see yourself from above,\u201d one person said.\n\nSheila MacLean, Narconon\u2019s manager, said the drills were designed to teach the participants self-determinism, self-control and discipline, and to help them break away from destructive habits. \u201cThese phases are not easy but our feedback has been hugely positive and the results speak for themselves,\u201d she said.\n\nBut some former participants described being left \u201ctraumatised\u201d. \u201cThe best way to describe it is that my mind had been shattered into a million pieces. I\u2019d lost all sense of myself,\u201d one person said.\n\n\u201cThey had a duty of care to look after me but it messed me up badly. I came out worse \u2013 significantly worse \u2013 than when I went in.\u201d\n\nThe Observer also spoke to ex-staff who described being left distressed by their part in the process.\n\nAlthough most senior employees are understood to be Scientologists, many junior staff and volunteers are not. Despite having no history of substance misuse, they too were required to complete the programme.\n\nSpeaking through tears, years after leaving Narconon for another job, one argued the approach was dangerous. \u201cThey are training you to follow orders, but these are vulnerable people and it can be traumatic,\u201d they said. \u201cI knew it was wrong. But at the moment I didn\u2019t summon the strength to stand up.\u201d\n\nIndependent experts said the drills were reminiscent of a \u201cmilitary boot camp\u201d or \u201cobedience training\u201d. The Observer first asked their views without disclosing the link to Scientology.\n\nProf Tim Millar, professor of substance use and addictions at Manchester University, said he was astonished by the allegations. During 30 years researching drug treatment in England he said he had never seen such techniques. \u201cThey\u2019re not approaches that I\u2019m aware of being used in any other mental health context,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said he was concerned the \u201cinstruction sessions\u201d could feel \u201cpunitive\u201d for people seeking treatment. \u201cMy personal view is that rehabilitation should be about using humane approaches to help people to regain their sense of self worth, which makes me doubt that any punitive approach would be helpful,\u201d he said.\u201cI find some of the descriptions of people\u2019s reactions quite shocking. They are so far removed from anything that I\u2019ve encountered that it\u2019s hard to put into words.\u201d\n\nDr David Bremner, medical director for drug and alcohol charity Turning Point, said requiring vulnerable \u00adpeople to complete repetitive drills could leave them in a state of \u201cheightened suggestibility\u201d. \u201cThrough these repetitive actions, the process of breaking someone down to being less than what they think they are makes them even more susceptible to \u00adsuggestion. And then you\u2019ve got somebody who\u2019s in a position of psychological obedience where you are able to then tell them what you want them to believe,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Sally Marlow, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King\u2019s College London, likened the approach to reprogramming. \u201cThe methods, as they are described, do not appear to be therapeutic. They appear to be something else. This is not understanding a person and where a person is coming from,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it is extremely concerning, regardless of what I think about Scientology.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Janet Laveau, the managing director of Scientology UK.\n\nParticipants later took part in a \u201clife skills\u201d course where exercises included writing down everything bad they had ever done, and handing this to Narconon. People who spoke to the Observer said this left people feeling exposed. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re poking around in the darkest corners of your soul,\u201d an ex-staff member said. They said they believed the programme could be beneficial for some, but often believed it did \u201cmore damage than good\u201d.\n\nThe Observer\u2019s investigation also casts doubt on Narconon\u2019s claim to be a secular programme that is \u00adseparate from Scientology. Clients said they had been reassured the centre was independent of the movement. One ex-staff member with knowledge of the sales process said: \u201cThey [Narconon] are really good at convincing the families that this is what your child or your family member needs. They don\u2019t focus on the Scientology aspect at all.\u201d\n\nBut the two are closely entwined. The International Association of Scientologists is the principal funding source for the Narconon Trust charity \u2013 which owns Narconon\u2019s Heathfield premises and supports Narconon\u2019s work in the UK. Several senior Narconon figures are Scientologists, including Janet Laveau, the managing director of Scientology UK and a trustee of the Narconon Trust, and MacLean, Narconon UK\u2019s executive director and registered manager.\n\nScientology beliefs also appear to influence Narconon\u2019s approach. Participants are allegedly told they cannot take part if they are on \u00adpsychiatric medication, consistent with Scientology\u2019s belief that psychiatry is harmful.\n\nMeanwhile Narconon\u2019s psychological drills resemble methods used in wider Scientology. Scientologists believe spiritual beings known as thetans infest every person\u2019s body. Through a process known as \u201cauditing\u201d, they believe they can bring these thetans under control \u2013 helping people on a path to spiritual enlightenment.\n\nYou\u2019re helpless there, and the only way out is blind submission or lose thousands of pounds anonymous patient\n\nTo learn the skills Scientology says are needed for auditing, followers take part in a series of drills known as \u201ctraining routines\u201d. Scientology materials show these include giving and receiving directions, sitting still for prolonged periods, and repetitive questioning \u2013 much like in the Narconon drills. US campaign group Narconon Exposed has argued the two are closely linked, claiming the Narconon Objectives are a \u201creligiously-based doctrine and practice\u201d, with \u201cabsolutely no clinical relevance to drug rehabilitation\u201d. Narconon denies this.\n\nThe link raises the question of whether participants are exposed to Scientology methods without informed consent. Several were reportedly unaware of the closeness with Scientology when they signed up. Once there, they were deterred from leaving by the fear of losing money or being rejected by friends or family.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re helpless there, and the only way out is blind submission or lose thousands of pounds,\u201d one person said. \u201cIf I\u2019d have had any concept of what the programme actually was, I would never have signed up.\u201d\n\nTo independently verify their claims, an Observer reporter approached the facility posing as the relative of someone needing treatment for addiction. During the call, a representative said Narconon was based on work by Hubbard, whom she described as a \u201chumanitarian\u201d who founded Scientology.\n\nBut she went on to claim that Narconon was \u201cnot related\u201d to the religious movement. \u201cNarconon is basically a secular organisation that is completely \u2026 It\u2019s not related to the Church of Scientology,\u201d she said.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Narconon UK logo.\n\n\u201cWe try to keep it very straight to the point. We don\u2019t promote it, and we shouldn\u2019t do that either. If we did that, people would accuse Narconon of actually being a front to get people to Scientology. And that\u2019s not what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d She also described how Narconon had a \u201cno refund policy\u201d, with \u00adclients usually required to pay up front.\n\n\u201cJust think about the mental responsibility the addict has if the fees have been paid up front,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of keeping the addict on the programme.\u201d\n\nIn order to enrol, she said the proposed patient \u2013 a man in his thirties who was a drinker and cocaine user \u2013 could not be on antidepressants, and advised he speak to his GP.\n\nAsked what to say, the Narconon representative said: \u201cI think it has to be a decision that is communicated \u2026 He should go to a GP and say, \u2018I have made a decision. I want to do alternative or natural remedies. I would like to come off this medication. How do I do it?\u2019 It\u2019s kind of a business in a way.\u201d She added: \u201cDoctors prescribe medication. That\u2019s what they do.\u201d\n\nIn an emailed statement to the Observer, Narconon UK said it had a \u201cproven track record\u201d of \u201csuccessful rehabilitation for substance addiction\u201d over five decades.\n\nIt denied downplaying its link to Scientology, saying it was open about its link to Hubbard. It did not deny similarities between the Narconon programme and Scientology methods, but said Hubbard\u2019s approaches had a \u201cpositive secular application\u201d.\n\nBefore being \u00adadmitted, participants are sent to see a GP familiar with the programme. Concerns have been raised that these assessments were not thorough and that the focus was on physical rather than mental health. Narconon disputed this and said it had a policy of refusing people with \u201ca history of psychosis, extensive psychiatric treatment or suicide attempts\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson also suggested people had concealed their histories of mental illness upon joining; denied advising people to come off medication to join the programme; said participants\u2019 health was closely monitored, and said those with addictions that involved \u201cdangerous withdrawals\u201d underwent medically supervised withdrawal elsewhere first.\n\nMacLean, Narconon\u2019s registered manager, said it was \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d that some people did \u201cnot get on with the methods the programme employs\u201d. \u201cEven the best-run services have their critics,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe are running a programme for people with self-harm issues, who are seeking to break down deeply entrenched habits, which is not easy to do, and we do not pretend it is.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of people who come through the programme really benefit from it and are very happy with the outcome.\u201d Narconon shared a folder of testimonials from ex-patients who say it transformed their lives.\n\nBut the allegations raise questions over why the facility is not subject to the same regulatory scrutiny that other rehabilitation units receive.\n\nRecords released under freedom of information laws show the Care Quality Commission has received 19 complaints about Narconon, including concerns about its methods and link to Scientology.\n\nHowever, it has not formally investigated 14 of these \u2013 received since 2019 \u2013 claiming it has no duty to investigate and that the complaints are outside its remit.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest the service is providing regulated activities for which they are registered CQC spokesperson\n\nCQC guidance says services providing accommodation with substance misuse treatment are providing a regulated activity and must be registered for this, adding that this includes a range of interventions \u201csuch as managed withdrawal or detoxification, or a structured psychosocial treatment programme\u201d.\n\nBut a CQC spokesperson suggested Narconon\u2019s programme did not meet this criteria because the approach was \u201calternative\u201d and did not involve medication. \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that the service is currently providing regulated activities, for which they are registered with the Care Quality Commission, and therefore they remain dormant at this time,\u201d they said.\n\nDespite its programme being unregulated, Narconon continues to display a previous CQC \u201cgood\u201d rating on its website. Records show the rating was from a 2016 inspection which covered the facilities, personal care and the safety of its sauna and vitamins \u2013 but did not judge the effectiveness of its programme.\n\nThe CQC report did not include details of the psychological drills or mention Scientology.\n\nFormer clients said they had been reassured by the CQC stamp of approval, believing it meant the programme was being actively monitored. \u201cWe did our research and it all looked above board,\u201d one said. They added that they were \u201cflabbergasted\u201d Narconon had been able to accept vulnerable people for years without regulatory oversight. Dr Bremner, from the Turning Point charity, said: \u201cWe need better regulation.\u201d\n\nAnother former Narconon participant, who we have chosen not to name, said his time there left him in a \u201cdark place\u201d. He has a history of severe mental illness, including psychosis and depression, but says he was \u00adpermitted to complete the programme regardless.\n\nIt left him feeling \u201cpressured\u201d and increasingly paranoid until he eventually suffered what he describes as a psychotic episode. Since leaving, he has received professional help.\n\nLooking back, he believes he should not have been admitted at all. A note on his entry form stated he was \u201cemotionally unstable\u201d, but he was accepted anyway. If Narconon\u2019s programme is able to continue running unchecked, he fears others may be at risk. \u201cI think they prey on \u00adpeople at their most vulnerable,\u201d he said."}

The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said at least 107 people had been killed and 165 injured overnight.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people are displaced, according to the UN\u2019s Office for Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha), with more than half the territory\u2019s population now crowding into makeshift camps and on to the streets of Rafah city.\n\n\u201cRafah is now a pressure cooker of despair, and we fear for what happens next,\u201d said the Ocha spokesperson, Jens Laerke.\n\nRights groups estimate that some 1.9 million people are now crammed into Rafah, a city previously inhabited by roughly 250,000 people. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said earlier this week during a visit to ground forces stationed in Khan Younis that they will \u201ccomplete the mission\u201d there before moving just a few miles south to Rafah.\n\nGallant added that military pressure will force the return of at least 136 hostages held by Hamas and other groups. \u201cWe will continue until the end \u2013 there is no other way,\u201d he said.\n\nThe UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees estimates that tens of thousands have fled Khan Younis in the past week, terrified of the deepening Israeli advance, now clustered along the border area that separates the southernmost part of Gaza from Egypt\u2019s Sinai peninsula.\n\n\u201cWe feel now that somehow it\u2019s our turn: death is getting closer,\u201d said Haneen Harara, an employee at a Dutch humanitarian organisation who fled to Rafah with her family after being displaced several times.\n\nPeople in Rafah were still trying to get essential items like clean water and canned food she said, \u201cas they force themselves keep going, even with the fear they carry inside them\u201d.\n\nThe threat of a heightened assault on the last refuge for the majority of Gaza\u2019s population has raised the stakes of ongoing talks intended to produce at least a temporary ceasefire agreement as well as the return of the Israeli hostages.\n\nQatari officials, who are mediating the talks along with Egyptian spy chief Abbas Kamel, expressed newfound optimism throughout this week that an agreement was in sight. This followed a meeting last weekend in Paris to discuss a framework deal between Kamel, the CIA director William Burns, the head of Israel\u2019s Mossad David Barnea and the Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani.\n\nDuring a talk at the Atlantic Council in Washington on Monday, Al Thani said talks \u201care at a much better place than where we were a few weeks ago\u201d and that the framework deal had been presented to Hamas for discussion. He also met some of the families of those held hostage while in Washington.\n\nGili Roman, whose sister was taken captive when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October \u2013 and who was freed in November \u2013 described \u201ccautious optimism\u201d from the Qatari prime minister during the meeting.\n\nRoman, whose sister-in-law is still held hostage in Gaza, said he appreciated the Qatari prime minister\u2019s sense of commitment to getting a deal done, but that for the families, the need for a swift resolution to the hostage crisis is \u201ca humanitarian issue\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen A woman in a house in Rafah.

A 30-day period where women, the elderly and the sick would be released would be followed by the release of male hostages and those Hamas considers active military personnel.\n\nReports from those involved in the talks suggest that major divisions remain, but the draft deal is intended to overcome the primary obstacle of objections to a permanent ceasefire.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While it was planning the midnight \u00adsorties in retaliation for an attack last Sunday on a US base in Jordan, the White House has also been sending signals that it will not let the worsening crisis unfolding in the Middle East go to waste and that it is developing a plan to use the turmoil as an opportunity to transform the region.\n\nThe message has been sent out through leaks and briefings to \u00adsympathetic columnists before today\u2019s departure of secretary of state Antony Blinken to the region, his fifth since the Israel-Hamas \u00adconflict began on 7 October, which will take him to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and the West Bank.\n\nBlinken\u2019s first four forays achieved little, certainly not for the 2.3 million civilians in Gaza, though the US claimed some credit for the fact that the war did not immediately spread to Lebanon. This time, according to the lines being put out, the secretary of state is carrying something more substantial in his briefing papers: a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d deal involving normalisation of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and substantial movement towards the recognition of a Palestinian state \u2013 all incentivised by diplomatic and economic sweeteners from Washington.\n\nAt the same time as this new \u00addiplomatic push was being briefed in Washington, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, David Cameron, \u00adsuggested that both the UK and the UN \u00adsecurity council could recognise Palestine sooner rather than later, saying: \u201cIt can\u2019t come at the start of the process, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the very end of the process.\u201d\n\nIt seemed very likely the former British prime minister\u2019s remarks, delivered on a trip to Lebanon, had been coordinated with Washington to drive home the signal that \u201cplans are in hand\u201d to look for enduring solutions to the underlying Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe US is also reported to be studying options for when its recognition of a Palestinian state would come during the course of an eventual peace process, not necessarily leaving it until the end.\n\nAmong the options, \u00adaccording to a report by the Axios news site, are the bilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, forgoing the US veto on the UN security council vote admitting Palestine as a full member state (it has had non-member observer status since a UN general assembly vote in 2012) and, third, encouraging other states to follow Washington\u2019s lead in recognition.\n\nAt the same time Saudi Arabia, which has not renounced its \u00adinterest in normalising relations with Israel throughout the four months of the Gaza war, would offer to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in return for a \u00adsubstantial and \u201cirrevocable\u201d step towards Palestinian statehood.\n\nView image in fullscreen Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, photographed leaving Downing Street in March 2023, faces the prospect of forming a new coalition government or losing US support. Photograph: Mark Kerrison/In Pictures/Getty Images\n\nThe thinking in the White House is apparently that such an offer from Riyadh would put Benjamin Netanyahu in a bind. His far-right coalition would never accept such a deal but would be robbed of US support if it did not.\n\nTo stay in office, and thereby to elude the threat of prison as a result of the criminal corruption charges he faces, Netanyahu would have to dump his coalition partners and go looking for others, according to the plan. His fall or the creation of a new governing coalition would create space for diplomatic progress towards the elusive two-state \u00adsolution for Israel and an independent Palestine. That in turn would create a happy synergy for Joe Biden in domestic politics by leading Arab-Americans, particularly in the swing state of Michigan, to forgive him for his steadfast support of Israel in its Gaza campaign, thereby helping save his presidency.\n\nMeanwhile, a Saudi-Israeli concordat that achieved Palestinian statehood would reshape the Middle East, primarily at the expense of Iran, which has sought to project itself as a Palestinian champion in a time of occupation and persecution. It underpins Tehran\u2019s projection of influence across the region.\n\nThat, at least, is the plan. It is similar in most respects to the administration\u2019s Middle East policy before 7 October but now with the added urgency caused by the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.\n\nThe long history of the Israel-Arab conflict does indeed suggest that real progress only comes after extreme violence. Egypt\u2019s defeat in the 1973 Yom Kippur war led to the Camp David accords five years later.\n\nThe quick US victory in the Gulf war gave it the clout to bring Israel and its Arab foes to the table at the Madrid conference in 1991.\n\nYou have in Jerusalem a desperately risk-ready prime minister, who, frankly, is fighting for his political life and most likely for his freedom. David Miller, analyst\n\nThe first intifada uprising that began in 1987 ended with the \u00adinitial Oslo accords in 1993 and the beginning of the process that was intended to establish two sovereign states living side by side. Conflict creates urgency in the search for alternatives, but urgency is not usually enough to produce results. The Madrid conference and the Oslo process, after showing great promise, ultimately failed in the face of the hard realities of the region.\n\nAnother key ingredient, argues Aaron David Miller, a former state department negotiator on the Middle East, is leadership. In Saudi Arabia, Miller said, there is a leader ready to take risks in order to win prestige: crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. \u201cYou have in Jerusalem a desperately risk-ready prime \u00administer who, frankly, is fighting for his political life and most likely for his freedom,\u201d said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cIn order to have any chance of beating his indictment, he has to stay in power.\u201d\n\nMiller suggested a bigger question hangs over how much of a political gamble Biden may be prepared to take, such as an early recognition of Palestinian statehood.\n\n\u201cPresidents on this issue do not tend to be risk-ready during election years,\u201d said Miller.\n\n\u201cThe basic problem is that time is not an ally of this process. It\u2019s an adversary, because standing in the way of any of this happening are too many moving parts and too many obstructionists,\u201d Miller added. \u201cThe most consequential election in American history is going to occur nine months from now. It\u2019s just too complex \u2013 and they\u2019re going to run out of time.\u201d\n\nAmong the problematic moving parts in such a deal are Saudi expectations from the US. Until now, Prince Mohammed has been insisting on a defence pact with Washington and \u00adtechnical \u00adsupport to build a Saudi nuclear power industry. Neither is likely to be approved by Congress.\n\n\u201cTrump owns the Republican congressional caucus now and he will say to them: \u2018Of course you\u2019re not going to give this to Biden,\u2019\u201d said Daniel Levy, president of the US/Middle East Project thinktank.\n\nThe success of the whole venture then would be dependent on the crown prince being content with the mere satisfaction of being godfather to a Palestinian state. It is unclear that would be enough to sway him.\n\nThe second shaky assumption is that Netanyahu would see a Saudi normalisation deal and the consequent continuation of US support, rather than the safety of his existing hardline coalition, as being essential to his survival.\n\n\u201cThey [the Biden administration] think they can stitch this together and create circumstances where Netanyahu is in a bind and has to ditch his coalition allies, and I don\u2019t see what they\u2019re putting down as being enough to do that at all,\u201d said Levy. \u201cNo one in Israel is going to say: \u2018Oh my God, Bibi [Netanyahu] blew an opportunity for Saudi normalisation just because he wouldn\u2019t agree to Palestinian state.\u2019 Bibi will just turn around and say: \u2018I\u2019m the guy who got normalisation with other Gulf states without any concessions.\u2019\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen A destroyed family house in Deir Al Balah, southern Gaza. Photograph: Mohammed Saber/EPA\n\nEven if Netanyahu did decide to dissolve his coalition and look to patch together another, the ensuing election campaign would take months, and it is far from clear that other political leaders would be ready to become coalition partners with a man they despise for a minute longer than the continuing military campaign requires, or that they \u2013 most of the moderate right and centre \u2013 would be much more enthusiastic about the creation of a strong Palestinian state.\n\nGiven that political \u00adreality \u2013 the absence of support across the Israeli political arena for a fully \u00adempowered Palestinian state \u2013 any formal recognition by western capitals or the UN security council would be largely symbolic, according to Rashid Khalidi, professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia University in New York.\n\n\u201cIt is literally meaningless,\u201d Khalidi said. \u201cSovereignty, settlements, occupation: if they deal with those things, then it\u2019s meaningful. But will they remove a half a million Israelis? No. Will they end military occupation? No. This government, the next government, the government after that, will not end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.\u201d\n\nOn the Palestinian side, Hamas has long acted as the spoiler to any attempt at a two-state initiative, and the Gaza war has immeasurably strengthened the movement\u2019s \u00adsupport in the West Bank.\n\nNor is it clear what a \u201crevitalised\u201d Palestinian Authority, proposed by US officials as the putative government of a new state, would look like. Its leadership, which has gone 18 years without a vote, would be unacceptable to most Palestinians. Up to now, elections have been blocked by Israel\u2019s refusal to allow the people of East Jerusalem to take part.\n\nSuch are the height and sheer slipperiness of the mountains \u00addiplomats would have to climb to make the plan work, in so short a time given the electoral \u00adcalendar, that many Middle East experts \u00adsuspect it may be little more than White House talking points designed to address the collapse in Arab-American support for Biden since the Gaza war ignited.\n\n\u201cI think the driving force behind this, frankly, is not a careful appreciation of the political reality in Israel and in Palestine.

It was 1976, and he read an article in Billboard magazine about the Ramones and the burgeoning New York punk scene, which \u201ckept saying that these kind of bands were inspired by the MC5\u201d. Kramer was so horrified, he tore the magazine up and flushed it down the nearest toilet.\n\nHe was in a federal prison in Kentucky, serving a four-year sentence for drug offences and, as he put it, \u201cfrom where I was sat, \u2018punk\u2019 did not have a good ring to it\u201d. \u201cIn jail, a punk is somebody that they knock down and make their girlfriend, you know: \u2018I\u2019m gonna make you my punk\u2019,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat kind of talk could get you killed, right?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a story that tells you a great deal, both about the MC5\u2019s importance and the lucklessness that dogged their career. The three albums they made between 1969 and 1971 were indeed set texts for aspiring punk bands and continued to reverberate through rock music. When Kramer reconvened the three surviving members of the MC5 in the 21st century, he was swamped by musicians wanting to fill in for their late bassist Rob Tyner and vocalist Fred \u201cSonic\u201d Smith: Lemmy, Don Was, the Cult\u2019s Ian Astbury and Dave Vanian of the Damned all performed, as did members of Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Fugazi, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Faith No More, Pearl Jam and progressive metal pioneers King\u2019s X.\n\nBut for all the undoubted brilliance of their albums, the MC5\u2019s actual career often resembled a band lurching from one disaster to the next \u2013 hype, mediocre sales, wounding battles with record companies, retailers and gig promoters, hard drugs \u2013 and, by the time of their split, Kramer was more or less destitute: broke and addicted to heroin, he became a petty criminal and drug dealer, hence the prison sentence.\n\nA number of the band\u2019s problems stemmed from a revolutionary political stance, which it wasn\u2019t even clear that the members actually believed in. Kramer claimed the band only glommed on to political activist John Sinclair, who became their manager, \u201cbecause we started to see the hippy thing was gonna be big \u2026 we figured the way to get hippies to like us was to get the chief hippy to like us, who was John Sinclair\u201d, and that their own politics extended little further than \u201cnot wanting to get up in the morning and have a real job\u201d.\n\nBut if their commitment to actually overthrowing The Man was questionable at best, the MC5\u2019s music brooked little argument. Kramer liked to note that the first gig he ever saw was Del Shannon performing at a Detroit drag strip, and that he felt there was little difference between rock\u2019n\u2019roll and the sound of drag racers: \u201cloud and fast, just like the music\u201d. That kind of thinking certainly informed one aspect of his playing \u2013 on the MC5\u2019s legendary debut album Kick Out the Jams, Kramer\u2019s guitar is frantic and distorted and stinging: as one critic noted, he often seems to be flaying the guitar as much as playing it \u2013 but Kramer was always a more complex musician than the proto-punk tag allows for.\n\nHe was a jazz fan, alive to the startling developments that were taking place in the music of John Coltrane and Sun Ra in the mid-60s. The MC5 might have initially presented themselves as the archetypical American garage rock band \u2013 their debut single was a cover of Them\u2019s I Can Only Give You Everything, a staple of garage bands the country over \u2013 but Kramer was already attempting to work his love of free jazz into their music: there was an edge of atonality and barely controlled chaos to his playing on their second single Looking At You; the early MC5 were as likely to hit audiences with the lengthy Black to Comm, on which a tough riff shades into free improvisation, as they were to play covers of I\u2019m a Man or Baby Please Don\u2019t Go.\n\nBy the time Kick Out the Jams was recorded, live at Detroit\u2019s Grande Ballroom in December 1968, their sound had become denser and heavier \u2013 the title track boasts one of the all-time-great hard rock riffs; the sludgy I Want You Right Now sounds like the MC5 are engaged in inventing grunge 20 years too early \u2013 but the free jazz influence remained, most obviously on the closing Starship, based on a poem by Sun Ra, strafed by bursts of improvised noise.\n\nIt was an extraordinary, incendiary debut, but its release was scuppered both by battles with retailers over the word \u201cmotherfucker\u201d appearing in the lyrics and John Sinclair\u2019s liner notes \u2013 which ultimately led to them being dropped by their label \u2013 and by what you might call the MC5\u2019s strained relationship with the revolutionary stance the album occasionally espoused. The MC5 had got a lot of countercultural kudos for being the only band to play for the demonstrators outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, but when they arrived at a 1969 New York gig in a limousine, the radical hippy audience denounced them as traitors, rioted and smashed their equipment up, leading promoter Bill Graham to blackball the band.\n\nBy the time of their second album, 1970\u2019s Back in the USA, they had been expelled from Sinclair\u2019s White Panther party for \u201ccounter-revolutionary ideals\u201d \u2013 the band members had spent part of their advance from their new label Atlantic on a sports car each \u2013 which you rather got the impression came as a relief. Certainly, the album significantly dialled down the lyrical politicking, as well as trying to make the band sound more approachable: shorter songs, less improvisation, a couple of old rock\u2019n\u2019roll covers, a ballad. The material was often great \u2013 Shakin\u2019 Street, Tonight, Let Me Try \u2013 as was Kramer\u2019s guitar playing, which was particularly fantastic on The Human Being Lawnmower, and it might have worked were it not for an abysmal production job, which left them sounding tinny and weedy, as if the whole thing were coming out of a tiny transistor radio.\n\nThe following year\u2019s High Time was a vast improvement. Kramer often opined that it was the MC5\u2019s best album; certainly it was their broadest in scope, balancing hard-driving rock\u2019n\u2019roll, as on Sister Anne, with anarchic experimentation \u2013 the closing Skunk (Sonically Speaking) was their most clearly jazz-indebted piece yet, complete with a horn section \u2013 and Kramer\u2019s Miss X, a kind of epic rock ballad that potentially pointed towards a fresh musical direction in the future.\n\nBut, as it turned out, there was no future. The album flopped, the drug problems increased and the MC5 broke up in 1972: only a few dozen people turned up to their farewell gig at the Grande Ballroom, the same venue they had packed out for the recording of Kick Out the Jams, and Kramer fled the stage, distraught, before the end.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Sleeve Notes Free weekly newsletter Get music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

He liked to suggest that his time in prison improved his guitar playing \u2013 he encountered jazz trumpeter, former Charlie Parker sideman and fellow junkie Red Rodney behind bars, who gave him lessons in improvisation \u2013 and he played an integral role on Was (Not Was)\u2019s eponymous 1981 debut album, his guitar sprawling magnificently over the dancefloor rhythms of Wheel Me Out and Tell Me I\u2019m Dreaming, but he was still struggling with drugs. Under the circumstances, attempting to form a band with rock\u2019s most unrepentant junkie Johnny Thunders probably wasn\u2019t such a hot idea: the rough live recordings that exist of Gang War have their adherents, and the Kramer-sung cover of Jimmy Cliff\u2019s The Harder They Come is genuinely impressive, imbued with a rueful power, but the whole thing fell apart before they recorded a single original song.\n\nKramer spent the rest of the 80s working as a carpenter, playing only intermittently. His solo career only really kicked off with 1995\u2019s The Hard Stuff, the first of a series of impressive, but overlooked albums he recorded for punk label Epitaph: they offered a more straightforward brand of hard rock than the MC5 had at their peak, but the songs were strong, the lyrics unflinching in their portrayal of addiction \u2013 listen to Junkie Romance or It\u2019s Never Enough, from 1996\u2019s Dangerous Madness \u2013 and Kramer\u2019s guitar never failed to wail thrillingly. Citizen Wayne released in 1997 is probably the best of the lot: produced by Don Was, it offered an autobiographical suite of songs that shifted him out of his latter-day comfort zone into more experimental electronic territory, a brave gamble that paid off on the idiosyncratic Dope For Democracy and Count Time.\n\nHe spent most of the 21st century consumed by various warmly received MC5 reunions and, increasingly, advocacy: he became involved with charities that dealt with drug addiction and fronted the American wing of Billy Bragg\u2019s Jail Guitar Doors, which provided musical equipment to prisoners as a means of rehabilitation. He published a brutally honest autobiography and, catalysed by the Trump presidency \u2013 \u201che gave permission for every asshole in the world to be assholes\u201d \u2013 started work on a new MC5 album.\n\nHe could be winningly indifferent about the band\u2019s legacy, finding fault with every album they released (even Kick Out the Jams, he suggested, \u201cdidn\u2019t catch us on a particularly great night\u201d) and dismissive of the music they continued to inspire, claiming most of it missed their experimental side that he \u201ccould hear more original things in hip-hop\u201d. But you suspected that Wayne Kramer knew exactly how powerful the MC5 had been, and that their music would always be a galvanising force for anyone interested in making raucous, exploratory, righteously pissed-off but euphoric rock\u2019n\u2019roll, whatever he thought of the results.\n\n\u201cThe band always represented an unlimited sense of possibilities and action,\u201d he told an interviewer in 2022. \u201cWe were talking about kicking out the jams, not handing out the jams or thinking about the jams. We were talking about taking action.\u201d"}

It did not come without the occasional ripple of alarm, particularly when Italy established a 17-8 lead in the first half, but tries from Elliot Daly and Alex Mitchell plus 17 points from George Ford\u2019s boot enabled Steve Borthwick\u2019s reshuffled side to finish narrowly in credit.\n\nNo one would remotely describe the performance as perfect, as the new captain, Jamie George, had warned in advance. But squinting into the bright sun on a glorious Roman afternoon it was at least possible to see the beginnings of a team slightly less afraid of their own attacking shadow. Tommy Freeman, in particular, added an extra dimension as a roaming wing, wearing 14 but regularly popping up to pose a threat all over the field, and one of the handful of Red Rose debutants, the Exeter flanker Ethan Roots, was named man of the match.\n\nEngland\u2019s lineout was collectively a cut above and by the end a total of five new caps, including the talented Chandler Cunningham-South and Manny Feyi-Waboso, had received their first taste of Test rugby. The downside was the teams\u2019 failure to kick on in the final quarter, with Italy winning the try count 3-2 via a last-gasp breakaway score from the wing Monty Ioane that ensured the slimmest winning margin of this fixture.\n\nFor Borthwick, a win is a win but, in their first outing since collecting a bronze medal at last year\u2019s World Cup, this was ultimately not quite the fast start they had been hoping for. Lewis Hamilton will certainly hope to be quicker off the line when he joins Ferrari next year and Wales\u2019s Warren Gatland may pick up one or two hints of encouragement from the match video for his side\u2019s visit to Twickenham next Saturday.\n\nNone of the participants could have wished for more ideal conditions. There was not a breath of wind rustling the umbrella pines in the shimmering Villa Borghese and for those travelling England fans soaking up the February sunshine it felt as if spring had arrived early. When George first dreamed of leading England in the Six Nations, he likely never considered the potential need to slap on some sunscreen before kick-off.\n\nNor did he probably bargain for the sight of Eddie Jones sitting in the stands. Now the coach of Japan, Jones will be crossing samurai swords with England on two occasions this year and the chance of an early sighter was clearly too good to miss. For his former charges there still seems to be no escape.\n\nInitially, some bad old habits were also in danger of resurfacing. Three penalties inside the first six minutes gave Italy the chance to settle and after an early penalty for offside kicked by Tommy Allan it was the hosts who registered the game\u2019s first try. Through a gap in the onrushing defence surged their No 8, Lorenzo Cannone, and the ball fell kindly for the scrum-half, Alessandro Garbisi, to score by the posts.\n\nView image in fullscreen Italy\u2019s Alessandro Garbisi on his way to scoring a try against England. Photograph: Silvia Lore/Getty Images\n\nIf a 10-0 lead felt too good to be true from Italy\u2019s perspective, the ecstasy did not last long. Freeman is a player of genuine promise and he showed a glimpse of it here, slaloming over from his wing to provide the extra man and put Daly into the left corner. When England opt to play they have the players to cause some damage on the edges.\n\nThen again, so do the Azzurri. A lovely midfield flick from Juan Ignacio Brex opened up a little more space down England\u2019s left and, with Freddie Steward isolated, a simple scoring pass from Tommaso Menoncello to Allan put the finger-waving full-back over for a second first-quarter score. Great from an Italian perspective, too easy from the visitors\u2019 point of view.\n\nEngland needed to take the sting out of the contest and duly did so. Italy will not have minded hugely when England opted for a regulation three points from bang in front of the sticks rather than pushing for seven but Ford then put over a second penalty inside five minutes to cut the half-time deficit to 17-14.\n\nHaving enjoyed the better of territory and possession in the opening 40 minutes, though, England had no reason to panic. Sure enough, within five minutes of the restart they were ahead, Mitchell twisting around and through the cover to score the kind of opportunistic try that is becoming his trademark.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Breakdown Free weekly newsletter The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Defensively there is work to be done and Ford\u2019s five penalties and conversion could not entirely disguise an occasional lack of midfield thrust.\n\nEqually, it is premature to make too many sweeping judgments. All you can now say for certain is that England have finally shaken off their first weekend Six Nations hoodoo."}

John McGinn got the show on the road, rifling into an empty net after Anel Ahmedhodzic had hooked an Ollie Watkins dink off the line. Mr Watkins got Villa\u2019s second, finishing with aplomb after running on to an exquisite Douglas Luiz pass from deep. Leon Bailey scored their third, cutting inside his man before curling a purler into the top corner, while Youri Tielemans\u2019s was the next cab off the rank to make it 4-0 after 30 minutes. Less than two minutes after the break, Alex Moreno spanked home Villa\u2019s fifth and that\u2019s how the score stayed despite a spirited but utterly futile effort from United towards the end of the game.

It was a tremendous performance from Aston Villa, who have put their January wobble firmly behind them.\n\n\n\n21m ago 14.28 EST 90+5 min: Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder looks stoney-faced on the touchline, standing with his arms folded wondering if any of the match officials will be impertinent enough to eat a snack if he decides to go into their dressing-room to complain about that decision. But for the narrow offside, it was a well-worked training ground free-kick that Sheffield United probably shouldn\u2019t have showcased in public during added time of a game in which they were 5-0 down. Now everyone will know about it.\n\n\n\n24m ago 14.25 EST VAR: Sheffield United's goal is disallowed ... That. Is. Brutal. After an age, the curtain-twitchers in Stockley Park finally rule out Sheffield United\u2019s goal for offside.

Gustavo Hamer stands over it and \u2026 instead of shooting, curls the ball to the left. It\u2019s headed across the face of goal by Jack Robinson and Vinicius Souza stretches to hook home from close range.\n\n\n\n30m ago 14.19 EST 87 min: This win will send Villa fourth in the table, two points clear of Tottenham Hotspur. Sheffield United will remain anchored to the bottom, ten points from safety with a diabolical goal difference that is conspicuously worse than anyone else at the foot of the table.\n\n\n\n32m ago 14.17 EST 85 min: Matty Cash advances upfield unopposed before sliding a pass in behind for Diaby. His cross drops kindly for Rogers in the Sheffield United box but the debutant sends his effort high over the bar.\n\n\n\n34m ago 14.15 EST 83 min: Ben Osborn curls a cross into the centre and out of play when the shot was on. It doesn\u2019t make much, or indeed any difference at this stage but he should have had a pop.\n\n\n\n37m ago 14.12 EST 80 min: Aston Villa substitution: Morgan Rogers comes on to make his Villa and Premier League debut, having signed from Middlesbrough on deadline day.

He\u2019s definitely not being lined up to replace Unai Emery, who is going nowhere.

Sheffield United\u2019s half-hearted performance is greeted by a similarly half-hearted chorus of boos from those fans who haven\u2019t yet left the ground or adjourned to the concourse bars for a much-needed pint. Their thoroughly dispirited players troop off, four goals down against an Aston Villa side that have barely tried a leg since scoring their most recent goal on the 30 minute mark.\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.19 EST 45+3 min: Youri Tielemans tries to thread the ball between defenders for Watkins to chase but puts too much weight on his pass, allowing Fodderingham to collect.

Kamara apologises to his teammate.\n\n\n\n2h ago 13.10 EST 38 min: Perhaps out of professional courtesy and an unwillingness to humiliate their hosts, Villa\u2019s players already seem to have taken their foot off the gas and are just passing the ball around in the space between the halfway line and the edge of the final third.

And the fact that the jolt is coming provides hope I believe,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this week, a Forsa poll showed that backing for AfD had dropped below 20% for the first time since July, with voters citing countrywide demonstrations against the far right as the most important issue.\n\nAccording to the poll, AfD remained in second place behind the main opposition party, the conservative Christian Democratic Union, on 32%, while Scholz\u2019s centre-left Social Democrats polled third at 15%.\n\nThe protests, which are now in their fourth week, followed a report last month that two senior AfD members had attended a meeting to discuss plans for the mass deportation of citizens of foreign origin. AfD has denied that the proposal represented party policy.\n\nAfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla told broadcaster Deutschlanfunk that while it was \u201clegitimate to take to the streets\u201d, protesters should not allow themselves to be used to distract parties from the country\u2019s actual problems.\n\nChrupalla said Germany included Germans with a migrant background and that his party was not planning to expel them."}

Her voice is remarkable, the delivery of her songs more poised and their accompaniments richer \u2013 a blend of guitars (both picked and jangling), cello, violin, brass and synth overseen by producer Simon Weaver. That the record is less startling than its predecessor is down to a lack of the arresting imagery Priddy pulled out on early standouts such as Wolf and Icarus.\n\nInstead, The Pendulum Swing is a more consistent and domestic creation, its title referencing the urge to leave and change, and the opposing pull to return to the familiar. As much applies to tracks such as First House on the Left, where Priddy looks back at a \u201cboat made of old bricks and mortar\u201d, and family tributes Father of Two and Walnut Shell.

Medical research is being compromised, drug development hindered and promising academic research jeopardised thanks to a global wave of sham science that is sweeping laboratories and universities.\n\nLast year the annual number of papers retracted by research journals topped 10,000 for the first time. Most analysts believe the figure is only the tip of an iceberg of scientific fraud.\n\n\u201cThe situation has become appalling,\u201d said Professor Dorothy Bishop of Oxford University. \u201cThe level of publishing of fraudulent papers is creating serious problems for science. In many fields it is becoming difficult to build up a cumulative approach to a subject, because we lack a solid foundation of trustworthy findings. And it\u2019s getting worse and worse.\u201d\n\nThe startling rise in the publication of sham science papers has its roots in China, where young doctors and scientists seeking promotion were required to have published scientific papers. Shadow organisations \u2013 known as \u201cpaper mills\u201d \u2013 began to supply fabricated work for publication in journals there.\n\nThe practice has since spread to India, Iran, Russia, former Soviet Union states and eastern Europe, with paper mills supplying \u00adfabricated studies to more and more journals as increasing numbers of young \u00adscientists try to boost their careers by claiming false research experience. In some cases, journal editors have been bribed to accept articles, while paper mills have managed to establish their own agents as guest editors who then allow reams of \u00adfalsified work to be published.\n\nView image in fullscreen Dr Dorothy Bishop: \u2018People are building careers on the back of this tidal wave of fraudulent science.\u2019 Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian\n\n\u201cEditors are not fulfilling their roles properly, and peer reviewers are not doing their jobs. And some are being paid large sums of money,\u201d said Professor Alison Avenell of Aberdeen University. \u201cIt is deeply worrying.\u201d\n\nThe products of paper mills often look like regular articles but are based on templates in which names of genes or diseases are slotted in at random among fictitious tables and figures. Worryingly, these articles can then get incorporated into large databases used by those working on drug discovery.\n\nOthers are more bizarre and include research unrelated to a journal\u2019s field, making it clear that no peer review has taken place in relation to that article. An example is a paper on Marxist ideology that appeared in the journal Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine. Others are distinctive because of the strange language they use, including references to \u201cbosom peril\u201d rather than breast cancer and \u201cParkinson\u2019s ailment\u201d rather Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nWatchdog groups \u2013 such as Retraction Watch \u2013 have tracked the problem and have noted retractions by journals that were forced to act on occasions when fabrications were uncovered. One study, by Nature, revealed that in 2013 there were just over 1,000 retractions. In 2022, the figure topped 4,000 before jumping to more than 10,000 last year.\n\nOf this last total, more than 8,000 retracted papers had been published in journals owned by Hindawi, a subsidiary of the publisher Wiley, figures that have now forced the company to act. \u201cWe will be sunsetting the Hindawi brand and have begun to fully integrate the 200-plus Hindawi journals into Wiley\u2019s \u00adportfolio,\u201d a Wiley spokesperson told the Observer.\n\nThe spokesperson added that Wiley had now identified hundreds of fraudsters present in its portfolio of journals, as well as those who had held guest editorial roles. \u201cWe have removed them from our systems and will continue to take a proactive \u2026 approach in our efforts to clean up the scholarly record, strengthen our integrity processes and contribute to cross-industry solutions.\u201d\n\nBut Wiley insisted it could not tackle the crisis on its own, a message echoed by other publishers, which say they are under siege from paper mills. Academics remain cautious, however. The problem is that in many countries, academics are paid according to the number of papers they have published.\n\n\u201cIf you have growing numbers of researchers who are being strongly incentivised to publish just for the sake of publishing, while we have a growing number of journals making money from publishing the resulting articles, you have a perfect storm,\u201d said Professor Marcus Munafo of Bristol University. \u201cThat is exactly what we have now.\u201d\n\nThe harm done by publishing poor or fabricated research is demonstrated by the anti-parasite drug ivermectin. Early laboratory studies indicated it could be used to treat Covid-19 and it was hailed as a miracle drug. However, it was later found these studies showed clear evidence of fraud, and medical authorities have refused to back it as a treatment for Covid.\n\n\u201cThe trouble was, ivermectin was used by anti-vaxxers to say: \u2018We don\u2019t need vaccination because we have this wonder drug,\u2019\u201d said Jack Wilkinson at Manchester University. \u201cBut many of the trials that underpinned those claims were not authentic.\u201d\n\nWilkinson added that he and his colleagues were trying to develop protocols that researchers could apply to reveal the authenticity of studies that they might include in their own work. \u201cSome great science came out during the pandemic, but there was an ocean of rubbish research too. We need ways to pinpoint poor data right from the start.\u201d\n\nThe danger posed by the rise of the paper mill and fraudulent research papers was also stressed by Professor Malcolm MacLeod of Edinburgh University. \u201cIf, as a scientist, I want to check all the papers about a particular drug that might target cancers or stroke cases, it is very hard for me to avoid those that are fabricated. Scientific knowledge is being polluted by made-up material. We are facing a crisis.\u201d\n\nThis point was backed by Bishop: \u201cPeople are building careers on the back of this tidal wave of fraudulent science and could end up running scientific institutes and eventually be used by mainstream journals as reviewers and editors. Corruption is creeping into the system.\u201d"}

But what\u2019s beyond debate is the fact Mali threw that game away; they didn\u2019t make enough of their numerical advantage (which they enjoyed for more than 70 minutes) and they allowed the emotion of the occasion to best them. You have to credit the Ivory Coast spirit, of course. They were never beaten, they refused to lie down and their submine run to the latter stages of their own tournament goes on, and on, and on.

Mali failed to clear from the set-piece and it fell nicely for Seko Fofana to drive low and powerfully, through the crowd of bodies \u2013 possibly via a deflection \u2013 before Oumar Diakit\u00e9 got the decisive flick which diverted it into the net.

As if 120 minutes wasn\u2019t enough, we\u2019re going to have one more. Just one. Ivory Coast have a free-kick opportunity! Everyone will pile into the Mali box here, surely.\n\nUpdated at 14.39 EST\n\n28m ago 14.36 EST ET 27 mins: It\u2019s really Mali who are making most of the running now, late in the game, with a fatigued Ivory Coast team seemingly happy to hang on for penalty kicks. Players on both sides are suffering from cramp.\n\n\n\n29m ago 14.35 EST ET 26 mins: It\u2019s a teasing cross in from the right by Diabate \u2026 but it cannot be met by anyone in a white Malian shirt.\n\n\n\n32m ago 14.32 EST ET 24 mins: Nene tries his luck again from range, but this curling effort doesn\u2019t match his earlier goal in terms of quality. Way wide.\n\n\n\n33m ago 14.31 EST ET 23 mins: Hamari Traore wins a corner for Mali. Are they slowly turning the screw again? They need better deliveries from these situations \u2013 so decide to work it short. Bissouma loses the ball at a vital moment.\n\n\n\n34m ago 14.30 EST ET 21 mins: In Adingra and Haller, Ivory Coast have two attacking outlets that have really helped them since falling behind. If they can find either man in space in the next few minutes, they could create the decisive chance.\n\n\n\n36m ago 14.28 EST ET 20 mins: Nene slides it across the Ivorian six-yard box and it\u2019s nearly a terrible moment for Singo as he almost turns it into his own net. It\u2019s a corner instead. Fofana continues to handle brilliantly from these Mali corners, catching the cross without too much pressure being applied to him.\n\n\n\n37m ago 14.27 EST ET 18 mins: Bissouma is getting on the ball on the edge of the Ivorian box, but the defending is as solid as you like right now. Mali try and work it from side to side and Adingra gives away a silly free-kick, barging into Nene.\n\n\n\n39m ago 14.25 EST ET 16 mins: So you know how I said extra time was looming before? Are penalties looming now? You\u2019d have to fancy Ivory Coast if it goes that way.\n\n\n\n40m ago 14.24 EST The Ivory Coast fans are in incredibly good voice. A wall of orange noise greets the start of the second extra time period.\n\n\n\n43m ago 14.21 EST Half time in extra time. Grab a quick cuppa, but don\u2019t be long, we\u2019ll have 15 more minutes to try and find a winner. Boubacar Traore\u2019s long-range shot was the only chance in the final couple of minutes of that first period.\n\n\n\n46m ago 14.18 EST ET 13 mins: Mali have taken off a central midfield player, in the hard-running Samassekou, for a genuine striker in the shape of Ibrahim Sissoko. They don\u2019t want this to go to penalties.\n\n\n\n47m ago 14.17 EST ET 12 mins: It really doesn\u2019t seem like Ivory Coast have 10 men now. It seems like an even money game. Bissouma, not long on the pitch, unleashes a left-footed shot but the orange shirts rush in to block.\n\n\n\n49m ago 14.15 EST ET 10 mins: Mali haven\u2019t been particularly potent from corners, but this time Kouyate gets his head on a good delivery from the right but can only nod it over. Another big chance, that!\n\n\n\n50m ago 14.14 EST ET 8 mins: The orange-clad spectators are making themselves heard. Ivory Coast really believe they can nick this, but will they rue that Haller chance? Mali are on the attack now.\n\n\n\n52m ago 14.12 EST ET 6 mins: Crossbar! Haller with the leap, the hang in the air and the header and you really felt he was going to score, after meeting Kouyate\u2019s cross. But no, the woodwork denied him. Then Adingra is flagged offside when trying to sneak it down the left.\n\n\n\n54m ago 14.10 EST ET 5 mins: Wasted pass after wasted pass. If \u00c9ric Chelle had hair, he\u2019d be tearing it out right now. Mali must regain their composure.\n\n\n\n1h ago 14.07 EST ET 3 mins: I\u2019d suggest Mali just need to keep the ball for a while, and that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing now. A correction from Joe Pearson: 12th man? Since they\u2019re down one, isn\u2019t the Ivory Coast crowd the 11th man? Fair point.\n\n\n\n1h ago 14.06 EST ET 1 min: Mali appeal for a penalty early in the extra-time period but it came off the chest of Oumar Diakite.\n\n\n\n1h ago 14.05 EST Extra time begins Fancy 30 more minutes of madness? Oh, go on then. Mali kick off the first period of extra time.\n\n\n\n1h ago 14.04 EST The two managers are taking a moment to gather their players together for a pre-extra-time pep talk. Emerse Fa\u00e9 will surely be imploring his players to listen to the roar inside the stadium. Ivory Coast have really used the 12th man tonight.\n\n\n\n1h ago 14.01 EST FT: Mali 1-1 Ivory Coast Into extra time we go! Mali will be kicking themselves. It really seemed as if Nene Dorgeles\u2019s thunderbolt was going to fire the Eagles into the semi-finals, but Ivory Coast continue to fight for their lives at their home tournament. Simon Adingra\u2019s last-gasp equaliser is the latest example of never-say-say fighting spirit from this Ivorian outfit. They\u2019ll believe they can get through this tie, by hook or by crook, despite having 10 men.\n\nUpdated at 14.02 EST\n\n1h ago 13.59 EST 90 mins + 5: This is pure chaosball from both sides now, with just long balls, 50-50 duels and a lot of panicked running around. Mali are trying to calm themselves down, but they\u2019ve seemingly forgotten how to pass to each other, let alone the fact they\u2019ve got an extra man.\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.56 EST 90 mins + 3: Now I\u2019m definitely allowed to say that extra-time is LOOMING. Unless \u2026\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.56 EST 90 mins + 2: The Peace Stadium of Bouak\u00e9 is most certainly not peaceful at the moment. It\u2019s loud, it\u2019s bouncing and while Niakate receives some treatment after a clash with Haller in the buildup to that goal, everyone takes a short breather.\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.54 EST Added time: Seven minutes of it. The noise is deafening inside the stadium.\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.53 EST GOAL! Mali 1-1 Ivory Coast (Adingra, 90) Adingra has made the impact! Bedlam! After a long ball downfield led to a shot from Fofana, it bounced kindly for the substitute to prod it home with virtually his first touch since coming on.

Photograph: Luc Gnago/Reuters\n\nUpdated at 13.58 EST\n\n1h ago 13.52 EST 89 mins: Mali have made a couple more changes, including taking off Sinayoko, who has arguably been the player of the match. A bit of game management is coming into it now from the Eagles, which is probably wise.\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.50 EST 87 mins: Brighton\u2019s Simon Adingra is the latest player to be introduced for Ivory Coast. He hasn\u2019t been given very long to make an impact.\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.48 EST 85 mins: Djigui Diarra clutches on to another Ivory Coast header from another set piece. But now it\u2019s opening up for Mali on the counter \u2026\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.48 EST 84 mins: Mali are losing their discipline and it\u2019s now set piece after set piece for Ivory Coast, which suits them just fine. There\u2019s been a shift of momentum, as Kessie falls to the ground in the box and asks for a penalty.\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.46 EST 83 mins: Goodness me that\u2019s close to 1-1. Diakhite rises to power a bullet header from Kessi\u2019s corner and it shaves the outside of the post. So near and yet so far.\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.45 EST 82 mins: Good forward play by Haller to hold it up and then Kessie allows it to run out for a corner. Is there a late equaliser in this?\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.44 EST 80 mins: Coulibaly is booked for a spicy tackle and it means Ivory Coast have a free-kick in a decent position to chip into the mixer, which Seri does \u2026 without finding a target. Frustration.\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.41 EST 78 mins: It\u2019s Mali who look more likely to score the second goal of this game, in all truth. The crowd are trying to rally the Elephants.\n\n"}

Our discipline was poor \u2026 the lineouts, we had no tempo. \u201cI wanted to go in the game with some pace and to play some rugby. So the message was, we created a lot of that stuff. Half time, it was: \u2018Let\u2019s go out there and play some rugby and play with a bit of tempo.\u2019 Fortunately we were able to do that second half. We got ourselves back into the game, and we were probably a bit unlucky at the end. \u201cWe were just so slow in that first half. It\u2019s a bit hard in terms of the speed, and cleaning rucks, and getting in position. I said at half time, the ball is so slow, the only thing we can do at the moment is kick it. Which we did do. I said: \u2018We need to go and play some rugby.\u2019 That\u2019s the way we\u2019d been working hard in training. Whether we gave Scotland too much respect in that first half, I\u2019m not sure. \u201cA game like that, you can sort of throw the towel in, lick your wounds and think about next week. But the boys showed some character. \u201cIt\u2019ll be massive [for this young Wales team]. They [Scotland] were fully loaded. They were probably at their strongest. So I think we\u2019ll learn a lot from today, and hopefully it\u2019s a good stepping stone for those young players.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 14.46 EST\n\n52m ago 14.05 EST Gregor Townsend, the Scotland head coach, speaks to the BBC. What are his emotions, asks Sonja McLaughlan: \u201cIt\u2019s a fine one \u2026 A lot of the boys are disappointed. We\u2019re trying to say to them: this is a really important win. An important win for the next few weeks of the championship, but also in terms of not winning here for so long. \u201cBut we were disappointed with the game getting so close at the end, and it could have gone either way, with the momentum that Wales had in that second half.\u201d What went wrong? \u201cThe penalty count got against us. That was clearly the case. I think it was 16 penalties to four. Wales weren\u2019t penalised once in the second half \u2026 So that pressure will tell. It\u2019ll tell with territory \u2026 and then we were down to 14 men on two occasions. Look, there\u2019s more to it than that, but that put the pressure on us. Within that period we maybe didn\u2019t make the best decisions, more in defence, because we didn\u2019t have much of the ball. \u201cAnd Wales also played really well. I thought they were very good in the close-quarter exchanges and in the maul. And they got very close to winning the game. \u201cThe atmosphere was tremendous. You heard lots of Scots in that first half. And they were willing us on in that last two minutes, when we were on the Wales try-line. But the Wales crowd was amazing when Wales got back into the game.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 14.28 EST\n\n1h ago 13.53 EST Dafydd Jenkins, the Wales captain, has a chat with the BBC: \u201cObviously it\u2019s an extremely disappointing result, but we had a lot of boys on debut, so I\u2019m also extremely proud of the performance in that second half. We could have given up, but we stuck in the fight. \u201cWe said at half time, we haven\u2019t played any rugby in that first half. Second half we sped up the ball a bit and that allowed us to play a bit more. But in terms of having a young team, there\u2019s no fear, and we\u2019ll be looking to build on this. \u201cIt [the recovery] makes us extremely confident, because this Scotland team is one of the best, but yes, extremely disappointed.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 14.29 EST\n\n1h ago 13.50 EST The Scotland captain, Finn Russell, speaks to the BBC: \u201cProbably a little bit disappointed, to be honest. The win\u2019s brilliant but that second half was nowhere near where we need to be. First half, we played really well, we controlled the game. Second half, discipline was poor, two yellow cards, and that allowed them back into the game. As happy as we are to win, that\u2019s not the performance that we need, especially that second half. \u201cI think when we scored that try early second half, we probably got a little bit complacent, to be honest. We thought the game was done. But there\u2019s still a long way to go, especially away from home \u2026 \u201cFair play to Wales, they came back and put us under a lot of pressure. I suppose the pleasing thing is at the end of the game we managed to hold them out and win by a point. They had some ball in our half, and we were disciplined at that point. We managed to get the ball back and win the game. There are a lot of positives, but we need to be a lot better. \u201cThe frustrating thing is the points I was making weren\u2019t being listened to. One of the main points was: leave the ruck. And we kept going into the ruck, and we got a yellow card for going into the ruck too many times, and we got a yellow card for offside. That\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to review as a team \u2026 \u201cIf the message is \u2018leave the ball\u2019 [in rucks], and players are still going for it, those individuals need to look at their game and what they\u2019re doing. Because it was putting us under a lot of pressure.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 14.30 EST\n\n1h ago 13.46 EST Our match report will be coming up soon \u2026 plus lots more reaction.\n\nUpdated at 14.30 EST\n\n1h ago 13.43 EST The player of the match, Aaron Wainwright, speaks to the BBC: \u201cWe left ourselves with too much to do \u2026 we came out a little bit better in the second half. \u201cWe were just inaccurate [in the first half]. A lot of their ball came from our own errors. \u201cWe believed, 100 per cent. Maybe another five minutes at the end, and we probably would have done the job.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 14.30 EST\n\n1h ago 13.41 EST Well, that delivered on every level. Wales trailed by 27 points after Scotland\u2019s try soon after half-time. The introduction of the scrum-half, Tomos Williams, made all the difference for Wales, plus the abandoning of a very poor kicking game that characterised their efforts before half time. Warren Gatland\u2019s young side so nearly pulled it off: incredible.\n\nUpdated at 14.31 EST\n\n1h ago 13.39 EST Full time! Wales 26-27 Scotland Wales nearly pull off perhaps the greatest comeback in the history of the Six Nations from 27-0 down \u2026 but Scotland cling on for a one-point win! What a match.\n\nUpdated at 14.57 EST\n\n1h ago 13.37 EST 80 min: Van der Merwe dives for the corner! He\u2019s nearly over \u2026 but the game is over regardless! The TMO is going to check it. On-field decision is no try. But it looks like Scotland have edged home \u2026 They still had penalty advantage, I believe. But Wales kept them out.\n\nUpdated at 14.31 EST\n\n1h ago 13.36 EST 79 min: Scotland break down the left! They are nearly over the try-line for the winner! They are camped on the Wales line after a speedy break by Steyn! But Wales scramble back, and manage to hold them out \u2026 Gregor Townsend\u2019s men want the attacking bonus point!\n\nUpdated at 14.53 EST\n\n1h ago 13.34 EST 78 min: Wales have the ball, but there\u2019s a forward pass by Lloyd around halfway! Scrum to Scotland! Oh, how important is that going to be? It was a little pop pass in midfield and it went marginally but clearly forward. O\u2019Keeffe spotted it. Scrum to Scotland. Two minutes left \u2026\n\nUpdated at 13.34 EST\n\n1h ago 13.32 EST 77 min: Now Scotland make an absolute mess of their own lineout \u2013 it goes long and drops into Welsh hands! But they don\u2019t have much in the way of field position \u2013 they are around halfway, and Scotland are well set in defence.\n\nUpdated at 14.00 EST\n\n1h ago 13.31 EST 76 min: Wales mess up the lineout. They are running out of time! They really needed that. But still it\u2019s a one-point game. Can Scotland cling on?\n\nUpdated at 13.34 EST\n\n1h ago 13.30 EST 74 min: Back from the sin bin, Tuipulotu crashes into contact yet again for Scotland on the left-hand side. The ball is worked back into the middle \u2013 Russell tries a grubber kick \u2013 but Reffell reads it, blocks it, and Wales win a penalty from the resulting contest for the loose ball! Scotland have coughed up a remarkable 14 penalties in a row. Great read by Reffell, poor option by Russell.\n\nUpdated at 13.31 EST\n\n1h ago 13.28 EST 73 min: Scotland have the ball, for once, and work through some phases into the Wales half.\n\n\n\n1h ago 13.27 EST 72 min: Willem Dafoe, the A-list Hollywood actor, is pictured in the crowd. He picked a good match, presuming he doesn\u2019t have a season ticket.\n\n\n\n2h ago 13.26 EST 72 min: Dempsey and Hepburn are on for Scotland. Crosbie needs treatment after what looks a high hit by Assiratti. O\u2019Keeffe, again, has a look at the replay and says no foul play. There\u2019s a sudden lull due to the injury after a manic 20 minutes or so of action. Scotland will be grateful for a break, and a chance to gather their thoughts \u2026\n\nUpdated at 14.01 EST\n\n2h ago 13.24 EST 70 min: The home crowd in full voice. Scotland look shocked. But can they get anything going in attack? A test for Russell\u2019s leadership, that\u2019s for sure.\n\n\n\n2h ago 13.21 EST Try! 68 min: Wales 26-27 Scotland (Mann) Oh my word. This is happening! The maul breaks up quickly after the lineout, but Wales are moving forward and Mann snipes for a try from close range. The celebrations are riotous. Crazy, crazy stuff! Wales are on the verge of one of the great comebacks. But can Scotland, at some point, get down the other end and score? Lloyd converts. It\u2019s a one-point game with a little over 10 minutes to play. Wow! View image in fullscreen Alex Mann piles over! Wales are in touching distance! Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nUpdated at 14.52 EST\n\n2h ago 13.20 EST 67 min: Dyer embarks on a mazy run down the Wales left. He runs out of space, changes direction, finds some more space \u2026 The ball is worked across the field out to the right. Dyer then pops up there, on the opposite wing \u2026 O\u2019Keeffe takes it back for a penalty. The crowd is baying for more! Wales have had 69 per cent possession after the break.\n\nUpdated at 14.02 EST\n\n2h ago 13.18 EST 66 min: Tuipulotu remains in the sin bin. He was a massive reason for Scotland\u2019s dominance in the first half.\n\n\n\n2h ago 13.18 EST 64 min: Oh my, we really do have a game on now. A chip-kick goes over the Scotland defence into the 22. Rowe gathers, then passes \u2026 Scotland run it out from deep and space opens up. The threat of a sucker punch is there for Wales but Huw Jones is tackled by a desperate home defender \u2026 The volume under the closed roof at the Principality Stadium is turned up.\n\nUpdated at 14.52 EST\n\n2h ago 13.15 EST 63 min: \u201cIf they score again, it\u2019s real game on,\u201d says Davies of Wales on the BBC. I think it\u2019s game on now \u2026\n\n\n\n2h ago 13.15 EST 62 min: Wales were 27 points behind. They are now eight points behind. And Wainwright goes on the rampage down the left wing \u2026\n\nUpdated at 14.51 EST\n\n2h ago 13.13 EST 60 min: Yellow card for Scotland! Tuipulotu Offside, twice, says Ben O\u2019Keeffe.\n\nUpdated at 13.14 EST\n\n2h ago 13.13 EST 60 min: Wales camped in the Scotland 22 \u2026 The crowd is going wild. Wales are probing for another try, and moving within 10 points.\n\n\n\n2h ago 13.10 EST 58 min: Wales have the ball. Suddenly they are attacking with precision and speed. Passes are sticking. O\u2019Keeffe warns the Scotland captain, Finn Russell, that the next penalty is a yellow card. \u201cShall I tell the boys now?\u201d he asks. Russell is bending over backwards to stay onside with the referee \u2026\n\nUpdated at 14.50 EST\n\n2h ago 13.09 EST 57 min: A good chip kick by Lloyd over the top this time. The bouncing ball is a horrible one for the Scotland full-back, Rowe. But he does extremely well to dive on it and prevent Wales from having a run to the try-line. The home crowd is certainly up \u2026\n\nUpdated at 13.09 EST\n\n2h ago 13.07 EST 56 min: Wales surge forward again, down the right wing. Josh Adams sends a poor kick ahead \u2013 Russell calmly calls for the mark.\n\n\n\n2h ago 13.06 EST This is good stuff from Wales, considering how they didn\u2019t have a sniff in the first half. The prompting of Williams at scrum-half is key as the move towards the try-line and then a looping pass finds Dyer in space on the left wing. Game on? There are 15 points still in it.\n\n\n\n2h ago 13.04 EST 51 min: A test for Scotland now. Wales rumble another powerful maul over the try-line. Penalty advantage for Wales \u2026\n\n\n\n2h ago 13.01 EST 50 min: Ashman comes on in the front row for Scotland, Crosbie off, in the absence of the sin-binned Turner. Wales win a penalty at the scrum. Despite his team leading by 22 points, Gregor Townsend suddenly looks a bit concerned up in his seat.\n\nUpdated at 13.02 EST\n\n2h ago 12.58 EST 47 min: Yellow card for Scotland! (Turner) It\u2019s a yellow card for collapsing the maul during the try-scoring attack. \u201cYou don\u2019t often see a referee give a yellow card when a team have scored, but that was so cynical, you have to deal with it,\u201d says Owens on the BBC.\n\nUpdated at 14.50 EST\n\n2h ago 12.58 EST Try! 47 min: Wales 5-27 Scotland (Botham) Really well worked by Wales. Lineout, drive, Scotland have no answer to the power and co-ordination of the move \u2026 and get a yellow card for their trouble. Lloyd misses the conversion.

They kick a penalty for the corner from midfield \u2026 then rumble a maul into the Scotland 22. Scotland cough up another penalty, Zander Fagerson for not rolling away. O\u2019Keeffe is good with announcing why he\u2019s given a penalty. Why don\u2019t all referees do that?\n\n\n\n2h ago 12.53 EST Try! 42 min: Wales 0-27 Scotland (Van der Merwe) Another shocking Welsh kick gives Scotland time and space to run it back. But even then it\u2019s too easy: Russell takes the ball to the line, dummies one defender and feeds Van der Merwe. It\u2019s a fantastic finish from distance from Van der Merwe who runs beyond a despairing dive by Tomos Williams, who has just come on. Russell converts. Dee and Assiratti are both on for Wales along with Lloyd and Williams. Elias, Brown, Davies and Costelow are all off. View image in fullscreen Duhan van der Merwe runs in his second try! Photograph: David Davies/PA\n\nUpdated at 14.47 EST\n\n2h ago 12.52 EST 41 min: Costelow failed his HIA, so Lloyd is on permanently at No 10 for Wales.\n\n\n\n2h ago 12.49 EST Second half kick-off! Here we go. A one-sided thrashing or the mother of all comebacks?\n\n\n\n2h ago 12.49 EST \u201cCan someone tell the BBC to keep Nigel Owens for ALL games!,\u201d emails Dave, of the former referee\u2019s efforts on the mic.\n\n\n\n2h ago 12.34 EST Half time! Wales 0-20 Scotland Tompkins knocks on with Wales on the attack and that\u2019s half time tea and oranges. That couldn\u2019t have gone much better for Scotland, or indeed much worse for Wales. Perhaps it\u2019s time to revisit Michael Aylwin\u2019s match preview: \u201cBookies are cold-hearted, boring stattos. They generally ignore the hysterical whims of the rest of us, which is why they are so rich. So when they overlook a run of defeats stretching back more than 20 years, when they stick their necks out to say a side are likely to win despite all that, we know something must be afoot.\u201d Wales put faith in future as Scotland look to overcome weight of history | Michael Aylwin Read more\n\n\n\n2h ago 12.30 EST 37 min: Wales win a penalty inside the Scots\u2019 22 and kick for the corner. A converted try here and it\u2019s game on for the second half. But Wales muck up the attacking lineout yet again! What a shocker. It was Wainwright jumping in the lineout, and a decent throw, but it slipped through his hands. Set-pieces win and lose you games, as Graham Taylor used to say.\n\nUpdated at 12.32 EST\n\n2h ago 12.28 EST 36 min: Scotland\u2019s Luke Crosbie is under scrutiny from O\u2019Keeffe and the TMO for a clear-out that resulted in Costelow getting a bang to the head. O\u2019Keeffe says no foul play. Nigel Owens, on the mic for the BBC, says he thinks the decision is \u201cspot on\u201d.\n\n\n\n3h ago 12.26 EST 35 min: Wales, unwisely, send the lineout long and it\u2019s overthrown. Scotland mop up the loose ball, but Rowe is soon charged down after Russell finds him out on the left wing. Wales suddenly have ball in hand in the Scots 22, but a knock-on is spotted by O\u2019Keeffe. Now, the TMO is looking for a head contact by a Scotland player on Costelow.\n\nUpdated at 12.27 EST\n\n3h ago 12.24 EST 33 min: Scotland are snaffling everything Wales are sending their way in terms of high kicks. However, Wales win a penalty for offside, kick for the corner, and they have an attacking platform late in the first half.\n\n\n\n3h ago 12.21 EST Try! 30 min: Wales 0-20 Scotland (Van der Merwe) Oh, that\u2019s good from Russell, and a simple finish from Van der Merwe, who is smiling broadly as he trots over under the posts. Costelow is the last man standing in the Wales defensive line, but he\u2019s hopelessly exposed after more strong work down the middle by Tuipulotu. Russell bangs over the conversion and this is looking like a tough, tough day at the office for Gatland and his young captain Jenkins.
