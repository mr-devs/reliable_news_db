This year, things have been slower than usual, particularly in the Premier League.\n\nDuring the summer transfer window last year, Premier League clubs spent about $3 billion on transfers, according to Deloitte. It was a new record for spending during a transfer window, breaking the old one by almost $557 million. Even last January was far more busy than this one in the Premier League. The 20 league clubs spent a record $1.03 billion last year compared to the less than $127 million spent so far this year.\n\nHere's all the latest on the January transfer window ahead of Thursday's 6 p.m. ET deadline.\n\nJanuary transfer window:Karim Benzema, Gio Reyna highlight latest round of soccer rumors and news\n\nLatest news on transfer window deadline day\n\nAll dollar values estimated from British pound and Euro value conversion.\n\nFeb. 1: Hendry Blank \u2013 Dortmund to RB Salzburg ($4.3 million)\n\nThe 19-year-old German center-back came up as a member of Dortmund's youth academy, which he joined in 2019.

According to ESPN, there are performance-related add-ons included in this deal worth up to nearly $9 million more.\n\nJan. 31: Gio Reyna \u2013 Dortmund to Nottingham Forest (Loan)\n\nThe Bundesliga club reached a contract extension agreement with Reyna, a member of the U.S. Men's National Team, through June 2026 before loaning him to Nottingham Forest. According to ESPN reporting, La Liga club Sevilla and Ligue 1's Marseilles were also interested in the 21-year-old midfielder.\n\nJan. 28: Sacha Boey \u2013 Galatasaray to Bayern Munich ($34 million)\n\nBoey, a 23-year-old right-back, made 63 appearances over his three seasons with Turkish club Galatasaray.

Or did she?\n\nIn what quickly became the game show equivalent of \"the dress\" debate, some viewers argued that Carvale did say \"pink orchid\" as her first guess, yet she was not ruled correct. She proceeded to wrongly guess \"pony orchid\" just before time ran out. \"You might have been overthinking thinking of a type of orchid,\" host Pat Sajak suggested.

We're talking get the shrink on speed dial.\n\nBut the actors playing them bonded so much in person and in that chat during the extended strike-hobbled filming of the Peacock's seven-part series \u201cApples Never Fall,\u201d (due March 14 and previewed exclusively by USA TODAY) that they still text each other with adorable frequency.\n\n\u201cThat chat of ours went ballistic the other day when we heard about Annette\u2019s Oscar nomination,\u201d says Sam Neill (\"Jurassic World: Dominion\"), who plays brooding patriarch Stan Delaney opposite Annette Bening\u2019s overly cheery matriarch, Joy. (Bening earned a best-actress nomination last week for her role as swimmer Diana Nyad in \"Nyad.\")\n\n\u201cYes, our chat continues as we speak,\u201d Bening confirms with a laugh, still relishing the group lovefest that marked her first recurring TV series role. \u201cWe all ended up having a hell of a lot of fun on this. We sort of became a real family. I guess you could say that dysfunctional fictional family was, in real life, super functional.\u201d\n\nThat faux family also includes the Delaneys\u2019 four adult kids: lost soul Amy (Alison Brie, \"GLOW\"); finance bro Troy (Jake Lacy, \"The White Lotus\"); free spirit Logan (Conor Merrigan-Turner, \"Thai Cave Rescue\"); and physical therapist Brooke (Essie Randles, \"Speedway\"). Together, they face a seismic change \u2013 from surface bliss to alarming implosion \u2013 when Joy mysteriously goes missing. Is she dead, or just escaping the madness?\n\n\u201cApples Never Fall\u201d is another deliciously twisted creation from bestselling Australian author Liane Moriarty, whose previous books-turned-TV-series include HBO's \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d (2017-19) and Hulu's 2021 project \u201cNine Perfect Strangers.\u201d\n\nBy marrying a whodunit with Shakespearean themes, \"Apples\" unfolds like a crime thriller bent on grappling with existential themes that are hinted at in the kid-centric title. That mix proved irresistible to series creator Melanie Marnich (an executive producer on FX's recent murder mystery \"A Murder at The End of the World\").\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re doing a series, you\u2019re committed for quite a while, so you have to love the themes,\u201d says Marnich. \u201cFor me, this was all about the powerful way Liane looks at parenthood, at long-term marriage, at sibling rivalries, and all the sacrifices you make for your family, perhaps hoping for a payoff that might not come.\u201d\n\nWhen we meet Stan and Joy Delaney, they are celebrating the sale of their Palm Beach, Florida, tennis academy and diving into retirement. Their four kids smile for the cameras at the club dinner. But when Joy heads off on a bike ride and vanishes, cracks are revealed in the picture-perfect family.\n\nStan hides a simmering rage, but is it about his once-promising tennis career or something darker? Joy is so eager to still have purpose in retirement, she welcomes a stranger, Savannah (Georgia Flood, \"I Am Evangeline\"), into their home. And each kid starts unraveling in their own way, undone by relationship woes and other life crises.\n\n\u201cBuckle up for another Liane Moriarty ride,\u201d says Marnich. \u201cIt\u2019s a family drama, it\u2019s a mystery, it\u2019s dark but it\u2019s funny. And oh wait, really it\u2019s about love. So, there\u2019s a lot in there.\u201d\n\nBening says she was a fan of Moriarty\u2019s work before signing on to the project.\n\n\u201cThe great joy of this kind of long shoot is you really live with the characters and the story,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can wake up suddenly with a great idea, and bring that to the set and talk about it. I loved doing this, and would do it again.\u201d\n\nIn fact, there was more time than the cast ever hoped for to make subtle revisions. After shooting five of the episodes on the Gold Coast of Australia, production halted in May during the Hollywood writers' strike, which cut Marnich out of the picture. The team regrouped to film the final two episodes only in December.\n\nBoth Bening and Neill say they were lured to \u201cApples Never Fall\u201d by producer David Heyman, whose track record includes the Harry Potter franchise and, more recently, \u201cWonka\u201d and \u201cBarbie.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything he touches seems to turn to gold, so I felt confident there,\u201d says Neill, who has continued his screen work despite a diagnosis of Stage 3 lymphoma. He says Stan is in many ways his polar opposite, from his demeanor to his tennis skills.\n\n\u201cStan, it\u2019s fair to say, is an alpha male, which is decidedly not me,\u201d he says with a laugh. As for the tennis scenes, which often show him drilling the ball at family members, he says \u201cthere was a bit of an education there. I\u2019ve played, but not at Stan\u2019s level.\u201d\n\nBening says Neill brought a gravitas to his role that \u201chelped anchor us all. He just has something, an inner life I guess, that immediately shows up on the screen in that look of his. But off camera, he couldn\u2019t be a more fun guy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s good to know, since \u201cApples Never Fall\u201d showcases a seemingly malevolent side of Neill's character. But that\u2019s the point. The Delaneys aren\u2019t quite who they seem to be, which makes for good fun in the guessing game department.\n\n\u201cThe key question here seems to be, how bad is Stan?\u201d says Neill. \u201cBut the bigger question is, how capable are any of us of doing the worst things?\u201d\n\nNo doubt a question the family of actors who play the Delaneys will continue to hash out in their group chat."}

Just ask your local meteorologist. And if trained experts have trouble forecasting what sort of temperatures are in store across the U.S., then what should we expect from a simple marmot?\n\nCome Groundhog Day on Friday, many will gather in Pennsylvania's Gobbler's Knob to eagerly await whether Punxsutawney Phil is destined to see his shadow, signaling another six weeks of winter. But if historical data is any indication, placing our faith in Phil and other lesser-known groundhogs to determine the length of winter may be a foolhardy endeavor.\n\nStill, the fun tradition to break up the monotony of the bitter cold months has endured for well over a century, regardless of how often Phil is right. Here's what to know about just how reliable his predications have come to be:\n\nGroundhog fun facts:Punxsutawney Phil and lesser-known groundhogs do more than just predict the weather\n\nHow often is Punxsutawney Phil right?\n\nSadly, the groundhog is often wrong when it comes to his predictions.\n\nLast year was the third straight year the groundhog has spotted his shadow, something he has done 107 times since his first prediction in 1887. Though he has apparently seen his shadow in 84% of his predictions, Phil has been right only about 39% of the time, according to the Stormfax Weather Almanac.\n\nPhil's track record in a recent 10-year span has kept up with that historical trend, with the groundhog being right just 40% of the time, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information. The agency compared U.S. national temperatures with Phil\u2019s forecasts to arrive at its conclusion.\n\n\"Somehow, according to our experts ... the groundhog has been less accurate than a coin flip over the past ten years,\" the center said in an email to USA TODAY. Hey, maybe PETA is onto something after all. The animal rights group suggested that Phil's duties be replaced with a coin toss.\n\nIn Graphics: How accurate is Phil?A visual guide to Punxsutawney Phil and other animals that forecast the weather on Groundhog Day\n\nIn 2022, the most recent year analyzed, the contiguous United States saw slightly below average temperatures in February and above average temperatures in March after Phil forecasted a long winter.\n\n\"Predicting the arrival of springtime for an entire country, especially one with such varied regional climates as the United States, isn\u2019t easy,\" the center said. \"Phil\u2019s track record is evidence of that.\"\n\nYou might find disagreement from the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club's Inner Circle, the group that puts on the annual event and takes care of Phil. The group says the groundhog's prediction is right \"100% of the time, of course!\"\n\nHow many times has he predicted a longer winter or early spring?\n\nThe Groundhog Day gathering has become a cornerstone event in Punxsutawney, which has marked the occasion every year since mention of the holiday first appeared in 1886 in the local newspaper, according to the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club.\n\nTourists from all over the world make the trek to Gobbler's Knob, where the club's president speaks \"groundhogese\" to Phil before translating the animal's prediction in a tradition stemming from an ancient European celebrations and German lore.\n\nSince 1887, Punxsutawney Phil has predicted the weather outlook 127 times. There have been only 10 instances where it was not recorded (including in 1886) and once where he did not appear (1943).\n\nHe has seen his shadow the most, as he has predicted a longer winter 107 (84%) times. Here's are all of his results since 1886:\n\nSaw shadow (six more weeks of winter): 107\n\nNo shadow (early spring): 19\n\nPartial shadow: 1\n\nNo record: 10\n\nDid not appear: 1\n\nPunxsutawney Phil's recent predictions and Groundhog Day results\n\nHere are the past 10 predictions made by Punxsutawney Phil:"}

The radio personality said, \"They're not even in school and you're paying $25,000 a head? Come on dude, that's just dumber than crap.\" Parents quickly tore apart Ramsey's response, saying they've been screaming at the top of their lungs \u2013 for years \u2013 that childcare is too expensive and we need a solution.\n\n\"People like Dave, pretending that this isn't happening is wild to me because it is documented that this is indeed the cost of daycare,\" a TikTok user wrote in the caption of her response to Ramsey.\n\nThen, this week, a 22-year-old named Emma on TikTok piped up with the fix: Stop prioritizing your career. Stay home! The reaction was swift. Scathing. \"I'll just tell the mortgage company that we aren't prioritizing our careers anymore,\" a user clapped back.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to both Ramsey and Emma for comment; the latter has since posted an apology video.\n\nThe rapid, raging rebuttals to these videos illustrate just how frustrated parents are feeling.\n\nExperts say parents who are very bothered by this content may be better off channeling their energy into their (in-person) communities if they want to create tangible transformations and keep their mental health intact.

The average cost of school-age care in small counties runs about $5,000, while in very large counties the average cost of infant-age care is more than $17,000, according to Department of Labor statistics. Some states, however, are far worse. In Massachusetts specifically, for example? Nearly $20,000 as of 2021.\n\nMarla Brassard, professor emerita of psychology and education at the Teachers College of Columbia University, said the TikTok users labeling Ramsey as \"out of touch\" are \"right on the money.\"\n\n\"People are trying to listen, but there's not an easy fix,\" says Robin Gurwitch, professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University. \"And that leads to more frustration.\" And videos like this get \"very triggering for many parents,\" says Regine Galanti, a clinical psychologist. They can especially sting when the comments come from those who aren't in the trenches as parents day in and day out.\n\nAs for Emma's suggestion to deprioritize your career: \"Women have been dealing with this guilt for generations,\" says Anna Marcolin, a psychotherapist and personal development life coach. \"We feel guilty, many of us, even if we want to work, we feel guilty at times, leaving our kids home, whether with a nanny or having to put them in daycare. And it's OK to want to work.\"\n\nMoney and the social media vortex\n\nIt's easy to spout whatever you want on social media with little concern for the consequences. \"We're happy to sound off on social media about our real feelings about each other with money,\" Marcolin adds. \"And we don't even know who each other is.\" Who actually knows the financial difficulties families face?\n\nIf Ramsey's words in particular made your skin crawl, you were in good company. \"If I'm watching something, and that's not my lived experience, then it can become very frustrating,\" Gurwitch.\n\nThose frustrations could in turn harm your mental health \u2013 so it behooves you to take some action.\n\nFeeling stressed?Tips for how to reduce stress in your daily life\n\n'Back off and reserve judgment'\n\nBrassard believes the TikTok user who rebutted Ramsey \"is an excellent model of how to educate without escalating a misunderstanding.\" If these TikToks are bothering you that much, of course, you can always stop watching them. Plus, solutions exist away from phone screens.\n\nParents looking to take action beyond TikTok can take turns watching each other's kids to attend community events and advocate for solutions to the child care crisis, Gurwitch suggests. Or maybe start a letter-writing campaign. \"It won't change overnight,\" Gurwitch says. \"But at least I feel like I'm taking an action.\" Without action, you might feel increased hopelessness \u2013 which won't do you any good.\n\nThat said, if you're not a parent but somehow feel the need to weigh in, do your research first: \"Unless you have or recently had a preschool age child you are likely to be ignorant of the current child care situation; things have changed so much in the past decade and even worse since the pandemic,\" Brassard adds.\n\nAlso, don't shame parents for their child care choices. \"Back off and reserve judgment for why people are choosing to put their kids in daycare,\" Marcolin says.\n\nThe bottom line here: Don't post without concrete knowledge. You'll save yourself \u2013 and viewers \u2013 many a headache.\n\nIn case you missed:Kourtney Kardashian, Travis Barker welcome baby. Let the attachment parenting begin."}

Following the collapse of the AAFC, they moved to the NFL in 1950.\n\nIn the 70s, the 49ers won three consecutive NFC Western division titles from 1970 to 1972. Later, in 1982, they won their first-ever league championship by defeating Cincinnati 26-21 in Super Bowl XVI. The 49ers went on to win four more Super Bowl titles.\n\nFinally, in 2014, the team moved from Candlestick Park to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nShowtime:Usher is the latest to headline a star-studded list of Super Bowl halftime shows\n\nHow did the San Francisco 49ers get the name?\n\nThe history of the San Francisco 49ers explains that Allen E. Sorrell, who was Tony Morabito's partner and a part owner of the newly formed All-America Football Conference franchise in 1946, proposed the name \"49ers\" for the team.\n\nSorrell suggested this name after the influx of people who rushed to the west for gold. It is believed that this was the only name that the team has been associated with in San Francisco.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers logo history\n\nThe original team logo depicted the city's roots and showed a gold miner wearing boots and a lumberjack shirt, wielding a pair of pistols. The design was adopted from the side of railway freight cars.\n\nSince then, the team has used some variation of the logo, but the current version consists of the letters \"SF\" in white against a red oval. This logo was first introduced in 1962 and has remained in use ever since in some form.\n\nWho is Sourdough Sam, the 49ers mascot?\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers had their first mascot in the 1950s, which was a mule named Clementine. Clementine wore a red saddle blanket.\n\nLater, the team changed to a gold rush prospector-themed mascot, which appeared in the 1970's.\n\nIn 1994, the San Francisco 49ers adopted Sourdough Sam as their official mascot. It is claimed that Sourdough Sam is the hardest working mascot in the NFL. Sam is a gold miner and loves sourdough. He takes the bread with him for lunch on his long days of digging in the gold mines. This is how he got his nickname, Sourdough Sam.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers all-time statistical information\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers franchise has been in existence since 1946 and have played 78 seasons.

The story, reported and written by Chris Mannix, was intended to be part of the March edition of the magazine that hits newsstands at the end of February. But on Wednesday, just days before the issue was scheduled to be printed, Orestes Baez, an Arena Group executive, told top editors not to include it. Multiple Sports Illustrated staffers said they had never seen a story removed in such a manner.\n\nA spokesman for Baez, Steve Janisse, said that the story was removed from the print magazine because it was no longer newsy, and the outlet was still planning to publish the story online. Sports Illustrated publishes its regular issues once a month and usually has a lead time of several weeks before printing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe story was not pulled,\u201d Janisse said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it may not be normal, but as you can imagine, Orestes is new to that team, and there\u2019s a lot of changes in the newsroom. I think they\u2019re trying to figure out their roles and new places.\u201d\n\nThe apparent meddling in the editorial process by the business side of the outlet is the latest challenge to morale at SI, after mass layoff notices were sent to nearly the entire staff last month, amid an ongoing dispute over millions of dollars in licensing fees between the outlet\u2019s owner and publisher.\n\nBaez is serving as the de facto general manager of Sports Illustrated after several executives at the Arena Group were fired in recent weeks by the largest shareholder of the company, 5-Hour energy founder Manoj Bhargava.\n\nBhargava made his investment in Arena last year, then briefly was named interim CEO before relinquishing that role. At an introductory meeting with Sports Illustrated staffers late last year, Bhargava lectured the staff about bias in journalism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Cannella, the editor in chief of Sports Illustrated, referred questions Thursday to Arena. Mannix did not reply to a text message. Baez did not reply to an email.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe story in question was an examination of USA Boxing\u2019s new transgender policy that was announced around New Year\u2019s Eve and the backlash it has received from various sides of the issue. The policy requires genital-reassignment surgery and stringent hormone testing for transgender athletes before competition, and Mannix\u2019s story quoted both advocates of transgender participation in the sport and those opposed to it. It quoted advocates who were pushing for a more inclusive policy, as well as an exercise science professor who said transgender athletes competing against women still would have a physical advantage.\n\nThe story was sent around to staffers Tuesday, as is the protocol for the final proofs of print magazine stories. Baez is on those emails, too. On Wednesday, a new story about the NBA was unexpectedly circulated in its place, multiple SI staffers said. Multiple people with knowledge of the events said that happened after Baez spoke with Cannella about pulling the story.\n\nMultiple SI staffers said they were particularly stung by the decision because they believed SI has done notable work on the issue of transgender participation in sports, including by former staffer Julie Kliegman and a profile of swimmer Lia Thomas by Robert Sanchez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe episode arrives during a precarious moment for Sports Illustrated. The storied publication has been owned since 2019 by Authentic Brands Group, a licensing company best known for owning the brands to non-journalistic entities such as Elvis Presley and Billabong. The Arena Group has an agreement to pay $15 million annually for the rights to publish SI in print and online. It missed a $3.75 million payment in January that caused Authentic to revoke the publishing license. Arena then issued layoff notices to almost the entire staff.\n\nThe two sides are continuing to negotiate a new license that could prevent the mass layoffs. Authentic could also sell the publishing license to a new company."}

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight In emergency meetings in Brussels, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has spent months railing against the aid, finally agreed to sign on.\n\nThe agreement is a win for E.U. leaders who have increasingly struggled to work with Orban on key issues, particularly Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, and it is good news for Ukraine, which is running desperately short of both ammunition and cash.\n\nThe macro-financial assistance is a mix of grants and loans to be dispensed over four years. The first tranche could arrive in March, Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Economy said.\n\n\u201cThis locks in steadfast, long-term, predictable funding for Ukraine,\u201d European Council President Charles Michel said in announcing the deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the news, writing that \u201ccontinued E.U. financial support for Ukraine will strengthen long-term economic and financial stability, which is no less important than military assistance and sanctions pressure on Russia.\u201d\n\nThe E.U. is also trying to surge desperately needed ammunition to Ukraine, but will not meet the goal it set last year of sending a million rounds to Ukraine by March.\n\nThe weeks of fraught negotiations have spotlighted how a single strongman can disrupt the E.U., even on issues, such as Russian aggression, that many see as \u201cexistential\u201d for the union. And it has hinted at how precarious and unpredictable long-term support for Ukraine could be.\n\nIn the United States, a $60 billion aid package for Ukraine is being blocked by Republicans in Congress as they seek concessions on border security, something German Chancellor Olaf Scholz hoped would be resolved soon as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis by the way is also a good signal towards the U.S. The American president is a good friend and ally who is working hard to win support for his demands from the Congress,\u201d he said in Brussels after the deal was announced.\n\nIn Europe, Orban used his veto to block the funding at a summit in December, forcing heads and state and government to fly back for a second gathering. Top E.U. officials and various country leaders have been working furiously for weeks to secure his support.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAs if to underscore the sense of uncertainty and chaos, the meeting took place amid a massive protest by farmers who arrived in tractors, blocked traffic and set fires in the heart of the city. They called on leaders to focus more on cost-of-living issues, including high taxes and what they see as excessive regulation from E.U. headquarters in Brussels.\n\nFarmers across France deployed their tractors to block major roadways into Paris on Jan. 29, to protest subsidy cuts and new environmental regulations. (Video: Naomi Schanen/The Washington Post)\n\nA surge in populist sentiment on the continent could help the likes of Orban and challenge Ukraine at a dangerous moment in the war. Ukraine\u2019s strategy for 2024 is still uncertain, and behind the scenes close allies are concerned about their prospects on the battlefield and political disruption in Kyiv.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, however, Orban did not get his way.\n\nThe Hungarian leader had pushed hard for the possibility of a yearly veto over the money for Ukraine. Instead, leaders agreed to reviews of how it is being spent \u2014 with no veto.\n\nBad blood between Brussels and Budapest is not new. For years now, Orban has clashed with E.U. officials and leaders, using his acrimony \u2014 and veto \u2014 to extract concessions while playing to populist sentiment at home.\n\nBut in recent months, he seems to have crossed a new line. Fellow leaders see his latest antics as a genuine threat to European security \u2014 and they are increasingly willing to work around him.\n\n\u201cThere is no problem with so-called Ukraine fatigue,\u201d Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said as he entered the summit Thursday. \u201cWe have Orban fatigue right now in Brussels.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is for Mister Orban to decide,\u201d he continued, \u201cIf Hungary is part of our community, or not.\u201d\n\nIn the lead-up to the summit, top E.U. officials and leaders sought to pressure Orban to come back to the table and made plans to move forward by, for instance, cutting a deal among the 26 other member states without him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA paper written by the Council of the E.U. and leaked to the Financial Times ahead of the summit explored ways that E.U. countries could deliberately rattle Hungary\u2019s economy to get Orban on board.\n\nThe leak was widely seen as an E.U. effort to bring Hungary back in line.\n\nSome think it may have worked. \u201cThe swift agreement shows that Viktor Orban backs down when economic pressure is increased,\u201d said Rasmus Andresen, spokesman for the German Greens in the European Parliament, in a statement.\n\n\u201cHe has lost on all fronts,\u201d he continued. \u201cToday should mark the end of his power games.\u201d"}

Cruise ship passengers in flip-flops and tank tops scattered from the deck covered in artificial turf to rendezvous at their muster stations. It was only a drill, but we did have an emergency: We were out of margarita. And this was a Margaritaville cruise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEn route to our muster station, an anxious bartender stopped me and my fianc\u00e9, Dan, asking if we would like a refill. This was the last opportunity to get a drink for a while, he warned. Dan and I exchanged worried glances. Our novelty cup, shaped like a blender, rattled with ice. How long?\n\n\u201cAbout 30 minutes,\u201d the bartender said.\n\nIt was a warning shot. The website had promised a \u201cfloating island vacation,\u201d but we seemed to have boarded an extended booze cruise run by Spirit Airlines.\n\nFees lurking behind every corner\n\nI tried to book a solo reservation during a \u201cSeason\u2019s Greetings Sale,\u201d but a pop-up said I couldn\u2019t book a cabin for one on my particular sailing. That meant Dan got to come.\n\nFor the price of $239.20, we got the cheapest room with a window on the 658-cabin ship, plus five free drinks. A few steps into the reservation process came the add-ons: $57 for WiFi on two devices and $188.80 for other taxes and fees, making it $485 for the two nights.\n\nIt would have been $50 cheaper if I had forgone a window, and significantly more expensive if I added a shore excursion or upgrades, such as the $749 Ultimate License to Chill package that included express check-in, priority luggage delivery, 10 premium drinks and a $300 spa credit, among other perks.\n\nMy rate covered meals at certain restaurants on board, some nonalcoholic drinks such as juice and tap water (but not soda, one of the cheapest beverages on the planet) and access to the ship\u2019s live entertainment and supervised kids\u2019 programs during certain hours.\n\nIt did not include a \u201cfuel supplement\u201d of $15 per person, per night, or a gratuity fee of $18 per person, per night. Both charges appeared on my credit card after we boarded.\n\nBy the end of our trip, adding in specialty coffee, some food and more cocktails, we totaled $780.36 for the room and other charges.\n\nBig, comfy rooms meet bare-bones amenities\n\nWithout buying express check-in, it took us 30 minutes to board the ship after our arrival to the port. We went through a metal detector and couldn\u2019t bring drinks or food in our luggage, which was scanned by an X-ray (although I did get some plantain chips through). There were signs everywhere warning against bringing marijuana on the ship. The final challenge was getting through an obstacle course of salespeople vying for our attention like auctioneers, pressing us to buy drink packages, shore excursions and professional photos.\n\nOn board, it was calm. The \u201ccasual-luxe\u201d vessel, formerly known as Grand Classica, was built in 1991. It\u2019s considered old for the cruise world but had a multimillion-dollar renovation to add Margaritaville touches. Buffett references and beachy decorations abound, including a gargantuan, teal flip-flop statue, a brand signature we also saw at the Margaritaville Resort in Hollywood, Fla. There\u2019s a casino, an arcade and a spa that charged about $180 for massages. It seemed well-worn, but more dated than run-down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOutside there were deck chairs around two tiny swimming pools \u2014 or if you\u2019re a glass-half-full kind of person, two huge plunge pools \u2014 a pair of four-person hot tubs, a jogging track, some cornhole boards and a pickleball court with a scraggly net pushed off to the side. Dan and I brought paddles, but with the outdoor court being vulnerable to wind and rain, a game was out.\n\nOur room was our silver lining; much bigger, brighter and cleaner than we had expected. The title of a Buffett classic \u201cNothin\u2019 But a Breeze\u201d was painted over the porthole, and in the closet we found robes and slippers. The sheets were white and crisp with a subtle parrot motif etched into the bedspread. The mattress and pillows were comfortable. The shower got hot fast and had good water pressure. A corner table held $4.95 bottles of water and a $29.95 bottle of Robert Mondavi red blend wine.\n\nThe confounding process of buying drinks\n\nAt lunchtime, our options were the Port of Indecision Buffet or the Cheeseburger in Paradise Burger Bar \u2014 two of the three places on the ship that serve the food included in our rate. There are three other \u201cspecialty dining\u201d options where you have to pay extra, as well as in-room dining and a bunch of bars.\n\nThe buffet had an off-putting aroma reminiscent of another budget cruise I took years ago, or a retirement home cafeteria. Maybe it was the cleaning supplies, or maybe the food. We grabbed burgers (nothing to write home about) that we dressed ourselves at an unkempt salad bar station and sat on the open-air 5 o\u2019Clock Somewhere Bar & Grill Deck. \u201cI can see how disease can spread quickly on a cruise ship,\u201d Dan, who\u2019s a science teacher, mentioned as we ate. We discovered someone else\u2019s hair on his plate.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWhen we flagged down a server to order margaritas, we found out we couldn\u2019t cash in our five free drinks until we got a wristband on another floor. We asked about the other drinks packages, and the server described them at a rapid-fire clip:\n\nFor $99, we could get the Boat Drinks package, a discount of 35 percent off 10 alcoholic drinks, but only on drinks that cost $12 or less. The $119 No Doubts Premium Drinks package covered 10 top-shelf drinks; or the $119 Blender Cup Package, which got you six 22-ounce drinks (more than double the size of a typical cocktail) from a certain menu selection, served in a little blender (sans blades) that looked like an adult sippy cup. Each included an 18 percent gratuity charge.\n\nIt felt like a riddle. We went with no package, but panic-ordered the sippy-cup version of the Who\u2019s to Blame margarita with Margaritaville Gold Tequila, triple sec and a \u201chouse margarita blend.\u201d It was $29 and just fine.\n\nWe watched others struggle to order, such as the two ladies who had to go back and forth with their server for a few minutes to figure out how to get a Grey Goose and soda, price be damned. The complex system \u2014 combined with the constant pressure from staff to purchase more drinks \u2014 became a shared bond between guests.\n\n\u201cThe price [of the cruise] is fantastic, I\u2019ll give them that,\u201d said Peter Austin, from the Orlando area. \u201cBut they\u2019ve approached us, I think, about 25 times to buy drinks. It\u2019s very, very aggressive.\u201d\n\nComplimentary food \u2014 with a catch\n\nWe missed the complimentary dinner at Fins Dining the first night because we weren\u2019t aware there were only two set seatings per evening until we had missed both (we never got our welcome packet). That left us with Frank & Lola\u2019s Pizzeria, a specialty restaurant with red checkered tablecloths where we got a three-course meal for two for $20.\n\nThe Caesar salads were serviceable, but the pepperoni pizza was too fatty, like they added extra oil to the cheese or sauce. It left us feeling queasy after, so we took our lovely tiramisu back to our room to eat later. Wine was sold separately and couldn\u2019t be ordered at the pizza place; Dan had to walk over to the coffee shop to grab two glasses with our drinks package.\n\nThere was no messing around on night two; we showed up to Fins at 5:45 p.m. for the 6 p.m. seating. The sprawling dining room was decorated with white tablecloths and gleaming light fixtures. Dinner came with a bread basket and three courses. You could order an extra entree for $7, which some people around us did since the appetizers \u2014 three slices of tuna and a couple of arugula leaves for Dan, a slight bowl of gumbo for me \u2014 were comically petite.\n\nMy gumbo and signature pasta with shrimp were all right. Dan\u2019s Tuscan Mac & Cheese with grilled chicken, vegetables and a \u201ccacio e pepe sauce\u201d was inedible. \u201cIt\u2019s like watered-down Stouffer\u2019s,\u201d Dan said. We saw two tables send theirs back. I gave Dan my ice cream course to bulk up his brownie sundae.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor breakfast at the buffet, I got by with fresh fruit and English muffins; Dan went for breakfast sausage and some French toast he liked. The drip coffee was free, but nearly as thin as tea; another reminder that Margaritaville was cutting costs where it could.\n\nI talked to people on the cruise who enjoyed the food, people who hated it and one group that had a great review of their meals at JWB Prime Steak & Seafood, a specialty dining option.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d said Mark Seeley, 37, who came with his two friends from New York after seeing an ad for the cruise on Instagram. \u201cI thought it was really high quality.\u201d\n\nParrotheads have the best time\n\nDespite the booze cruise reputation, Paradise was pretty tame after dark.\n\nAfter catching a musical performance at the Stars on the Water Theater one night, and the stand-up comic the other, the party died down fast. We could always find live music, and no, it was not strictly Buffett songs.\n\nIf you went in with low expectations, you could have a nice time on this bop to the Bahamas. I loved watching people have fun \u2014 like the rousing party game we saw one night in the Euphoria lounge that got participants to do wild challenges (men wearing bras on their heads, people riding each other like horses). I laughed so hard my face hurt.\n\nMost of the travelers I met felt the same way, particularly those traveling in big groups. \u201cWe hear a lot of people have mixed TikTok reviews, but for the price, it was great,\u201d said Khaila Dennis, 23, a Miami resident traveling with her family.\n\nWe skipped the shore excursions sold by the cruise in favor of going our own way, saving money in the process. The Austins did the same, as did a handful of people we met. Dan and I rented a scooter in Freeport for $50, spent the day exploring the island, its white sand beaches and incredible local cuisine. We shared a fat lobster tail, fried on the spot for $25, from a shack on the beach; ordered two rum cocktails for $10; and tried a fresh conch salad, straight out of the shell, for $11. It was a ball, one we wouldn\u2019t have had if we didn\u2019t take the cruise.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nUnless you\u2019re a die-hard Buffett fan, I\u2019m not convinced that spending $780, plus the price of airfare and transportation to and from the ship, gets you the best vacation for the price."}

Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had their fans, but polls often found that each was generally viewed more unfavorably than favorably \u2014 often by a wide margin. Generally in prior elections, most Americans liked at least one candidate. Not that year.\n\nThis is certainly one reason that turnout was low relative to historical trends. But it also introduced an equally unusual voting bloc: people who didn\u2019t like either candidate but came out to vote anyway. And exit polls showed that those voters overwhelmingly preferred Trump.\n\nIt makes sense. He was the candidate of blowing up the system, while the system was where Clinton lived. But this wasn\u2019t just some interesting historical anomaly. In the three states Trump flipped to red that year, about a fifth of those who cast votes said they disliked both him and Clinton, according to exit polls. Trump won among those voters by between 20 (Michigan) and almost 40 percentage points (Wisconsin) \u2014 enough to give him the presidency.\n\nIn 2020, this vote wasn\u2019t as important. There were far fewer people who disliked both candidates, for one thing, given that Joe Biden was relatively well regarded. But over the course of his presidency, that has shifted. Now there is once again a robust dislike-them-both segment of the electorate. But, happily for Democrats, it\u2019s Biden who leads with them this time \u2014 and that lead has expanded over the past few months.\n\nOn Tuesday, Quinnipiac University released a new national poll of the 2024 race. It showed that Biden holds a six-point lead over Trump nationally, a function of his faring better with independents (with whom he leads by 12 points) and within his own party.\n\nBefore we go any further, we will note that this is a better poll for Biden than other recent polls have been. Without diving too deeply into this, there are a few likely reasons for it, including that Quinnipiac\u2019s polling has generally had Biden performing better and that margins of error make gaps seem wider than they may actually be.\n\nBesides, Biden does not fare particularly well when pitted against former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley in a one-on-one hypothetical general election contest. She leads in that matchup, thanks largely to less robust Democratic support for Biden and independents flipping. A 13-point swing among White women has an effect, too.\n\nBut let\u2019s get to the point. As you might expect, Quinnipiac also found that both Trump and Biden were viewed more unfavorably than favorably \u2014 they were \u201cunderwater,\u201d in the parlance. Independents viewed Biden slightly more positively, but even in that case only a third viewed the sitting president favorably.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaley\u2019s numbers are interesting. Almost 3 in 10 respondents said they didn\u2019t know enough about her to have an opinion, including a quarter of Republicans \u2014 nearly a month into the Republican primary in which she is one of two candidates. Even so, she was underwater, too, by a 15-point margin.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWe can break the respondents into four groups (or, rather, we at The Washington Post could and did ask Quinnipiac to do so): those who like both candidates, those who like only Trump or Haley, those who like only Biden and those who like neither. What we find is striking.\n\nIn the Trump-Biden matchup, there aren\u2019t enough respondents who like both candidates to break out their preferences, which is telling in itself. Among those who view only one candidate favorably, that candidate gets nearly every vote. And among those who like neither? Biden has a 13-point edge, with a lot of people saying they would pick someone else or just not vote.\n\nIn the Haley-Biden matchup, though, there are enough people who like both to break them out, and Biden has a 23-point lead. But far more people like neither of them, and there Haley is the one with a big advantage.\n\nThere are an enormous number of caveats here, of course, including that a lot of those voters who dislike both in fact won\u2019t vote. (Six percent chose that option in the Biden-Haley race.) In addition, if Haley was somehow very unexpectedly to win the Republican nomination, a lot more people would suddenly develop strong opinions about her, shifting the totals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, other candidates are in the mix, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In both the Trump-Biden and Haley-Biden matchups, he pulls a plurality of the dislike-both voters \u2014 but to do so in the election he would actually have to have a robust enough campaign to get on the ballot."}

From vowing to pursue meritless impeachments to nixing a border security measure to please former president Donald Trump, they have given Democrats plenty of ammunition to blast them out of the majority in November.\n\nRepublicans, by the admission of conservative Rep. Chip Roy (Tex.), have not a single accomplishment on which to run this year. \u201cFor the life of me, I do not understand how you can go to the trouble of campaigning, raising money, going to events, talking to people, coming to this town as a member of a party who allegedly stands for something \u2026 and then do nothing about it,\u201d he bellowed on the House floor in November. \u201cOne thing: I want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing \u2014 one \u2014 that I can go campaign on and say we did. One!\u201d He got no answer.\n\nMost Republicans voted against the overwhelmingly popular infrastructure bill. Now they routinely claim credit for it. Only occasionally do they get called out for hypocrisy. (Get ready to hear plenty of it as the campaign heats up.) With help from some Republicans in the Senate and very few in the House, Democrats were able to pass the infrastructure bill in 2021. As with infrastructure, Republicans have largely escaped blame for causing economic havoc thanks to Democratic votes for keeping the government open and avoiding a default on the debt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, however, with no one to cover their tracks, Republicans risk making themselves vulnerable to voters disgusted with partisan melodrama. On the impeachment front, Republicans embarrassingly have come up with nothing to justify the impeachments of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas or President Biden. As for Mayorkas, Republicans\u2019 favorite lawyer, Jonathan Turley, wrote in the Daily Beast that \u201cbeing a bad person is not impeachable \u2014 or many cabinets would be largely empty,\u201d nor is doing a bad job. He added that if poor performance were grounds for impeachment, Mayorkas \u201cwould be only the latest in a long line of cabinet officers frog-marched into Congress for constitutional termination.\u201d\n\nFollow this author Jennifer Rubin 's opinions Follow\n\nNorman Eisen, former impeachment counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, along with Democracy 21 founder Fred Wertheimer and researcher Sasha Matsuki, wrote for MSNBC: \u201cBoth the Biden and Mayorkas impeachments are clearly not backed up by evidence. \u2026 What really concerns us, though, is the way these impeachments will both weaponize a key constitutional remedy and undermine its sober original intent.\u201d In turning impeachment into a \u201cpartisan joke\u201d to satisfy four-times-indicted and twice-impeached Trump, they wind up revealing their own recklessness, irresponsibility and deep dishonesty. When Turley, a fierce defender of Trump during his impeachments, and Eisen, a counsel to House impeachment managers, agree these are baseless stunts, the jig might be up for Republicans.\n\nMaking matters worse, House and Senate Republicans\u2019 objection to a massive funding bill to secure the border \u2014 to make Mayorkas\u2019s job easier \u2014 only underscores their cynical disinterest in actually securing the border. Even for some Republicans, this is a bridge too far. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to have the president as a boss or a candidate as a boss. I came here to pass good, solid policy,\u201d Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said last week. \u201cIt is immoral for me to think you looked the other way because you think this is the linchpin for President Trump to win.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) denounced Republicans\u2019 obstructionism as well. \u201cThe border is a very important issue for Donald Trump. And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and Congress people that he doesn\u2019t want us to solve the border problem \u2014 because he wants to blame Biden for it \u2014 is really appalling,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThe American people are suffering as a result of what\u2019s happening at the border. And someone running for president ought to try and get the problem solved, as opposed to saying, \u2018Hey, save that problem! Don\u2019t solve it! Let me take credit for solving it later.\u2019\u201d\n\nPut differently, Republicans\u2019 brazen objection to arguably the most serious border funding measure in decades makes both their Mayorkas impeachment and caterwauling about the border look absurdly cynical, even for them.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the public is not buying any of it. Last year, a Wall Street Journal poll found that, concerning Biden, \u201cwhile overwhelming shares of Republicans support impeachment and Democrats oppose it, independents on the whole side with the opponents, the poll found, with 51% against impeachment and 37% in favor.\u201d As my Post colleague Aaron Blake found in a December review of polling that showed meager support for impeachment, \u201cIf the poll numbers don\u2019t move significantly toward where they were for Trump\u2019s impeachments (and are now for his indictments), a Biden impeachment vote could be tricky for a lot of Republicans \u2014 and for GOP leadership. And failing to even hold a vote would be a remarkable capitulation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement"}

Here was a man who kept his Paris apartment tropically hot, who wrapped himself in blankets and wore an overcoat even in summer \u2014 a man who, in short, usually felt cold. Yet his calculations showed that Earth was in fact far warmer than it ought to be.\n\nIt was the 1820s. Fourier, in his fifties and already a renowned scientist, decided to estimate the Earth\u2019s temperature purely from scientific principles. He took the amount of sunlight that warms the Earth and then subtracted off the amount of energy the planet radiates back to space. He came up with a temperature some 30 degrees Celsius \u2014 more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 colder than our actual planet.\n\nFourier knew the Earth was retaining extra heat, but he didn\u2019t know how. It fell to later generations of scientists to reveal that certain gases, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor, block some of the infrared light that the planet radiates back to space. When these gases build up in the atmosphere, Earth temporarily emits less energy than it absorbs from the sun. To restore the energy balance, the planet warms.\n\nGreenhouse gases absorb infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye but just as real as the light we can see. If your eyes could perceive light at the low wavelength of 6.3 microns, the air would look black with water vapor. At 7.5 microns, methane would obstruct your view. And at the 15-micron wavelength, you would see carbon dioxide.\n\nThat\u2019s how NASA\u2019s satellites detect greenhouse gases as they build up in our atmosphere, year after year. Let\u2019s take another tour of the Earth to see how CO2 accumulates over the course of 2021, the most recent year for which NASA makes the data available.\n\nLoading data... Explore Using satellites, land-based monitoring stations and a physical model of the atmosphere, scientists identified four contributors to atmospheric CO2: combustion of fossil fuels, burning wood and other biomass, land ecosystems, and the ocean. 1 / 5 Most of the CO2 added to the atmosphere comes from humans burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Here, CO2 builds up above China, which for the past two decades has been the largest emitter of carbon dioxide. 2 / 5 In Africa, you can see how fires, such as from burning wood and clearing agricultural residue, also add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. 3 / 5 Emissions are concentrated in the northern hemisphere, where most people live. Air spreads faster from east to west than north to south, but by year\u2019s end, emissions have reached below the equator and cover most of the globe. 4 / 5 Spin the globe to explore it yourself. 5 / 5\n\nWhat the globe doesn\u2019t show is that the Earth also absorbs carbon dioxide, either when it dissolves in seawater or is taken up by plants during photosynthesis. The land and ocean together absorb about half of human emissions every year, helping slow global warming.\n\nMost of the Earth\u2019s land is in the northern hemisphere, where plants suck up CO2 all summer long. By September, there is less CO2 in the atmosphere than there was in January. Then winter comes, the plants die, and CO2 builds up in the atmosphere once more. By the end of the year, for every million molecules of air, there are about 2.5 extra molecules of CO2.\n\nCumulative CO2 over the course of one year Note: Data from 2021\n\nCarbon dioxide sticks around in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, so those extra molecules eventually start to add up. On Earth, atmospheric CO2 has risen from about 280 parts per million (ppm) before the industrial revolution to more than 420 ppm today.\n\nAs a proportion of all the air we breathe, it\u2019s not much. Yet some molecules are potent, even in small concentrations. Consider that you can kill a full grown adult with as little as 70 milligrams of arsenic, or about 1 ppm.\n\nEarth has not received a lethal dose of carbon dioxide, but as CO2 and other greenhouses gases build up in the atmosphere, the planet\u2019s temperature must rise. Earth\u2019s average temperature has increased 1.3 degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution. Most projections expect more than another degree by the end of the century.\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nA warmer planet will cause second-order effects, although they are harder to predict. Glaciers and ice caps will melt, but how much? How high will seas rise as a result? Will storms, which feed on heat, grow much stronger?\n\nEvery solution to slow down global warming essentially boils down to one of two categories: emit fewer greenhouse gases or absorb more of them. In the first category are low-carbon electricity sources; electric vehicles; and \u201cgreen\u201d cement. The second category includes ideas like planting a trillion trees; burying carbon-rich bricks; and deploying giant carbon-sucking vacuums. Energy and money are pouring in, but there are no magic bullets.\n\nFourier announced his discovery in 1824, so this year marks the bicentennial of humanity\u2019s reckoning with the greenhouse effect (although Fourier never called it that). Since Fourier\u2019s day, people have been trying to figure out what warms up the atmosphere or how to cool it down. We have been grappling with global warming for 200 years.\n\nNote: At the request of readers, I changed the direction of the globe\u2019s rotation to match that of the actual Earth. But I will only take this realism so far, and I categorically refuse to make it spin around 365 times in the year."}

And so, as a pro-choice liberal, I want to thank a group of pro-life organizations that spoke up this week in support of a congressional deal to improve the child tax credit. Antiabortion Americans United for Life hailed the bill, which will primarily help lower-income families and families with a larger number of children, as \u201ca core part of an American pro-life and pro-family future.\u201d Pro-choice Center for American Progress President Patrick Gaspard described the legislation as \u201can unmissable opportunity to reduce poverty among low-income children and families.\u201d\n\nWith any luck, this will be the first major bipartisan collaboration to help American families this year, but not the last. There\u2019s real cross-party support for policies to make it easier, safer and cheaper to have and raise children. With practice, such cooperation just might become a habit in Washington.\n\nThe often-justified liberal criticism of pro-life conservatives has long been that they elevate the lives of unborn babies over the lives of mothers, and that they\u2019re eager to prioritize children in the womb but not in the world. After birth, it becomes more important to refuse \u201cattempts to expand the welfare state\u201d than to feed poor children when school is out during the summer; more vital to enforce a traditional heterosexual nuclear family where women stay home than to make sure children have access to safe, quality day care; more essential to reject federal help than to make sure children have health insurance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Roe v. Wade fell in 2022, many conservative lawmakers seemed to take every available opportunity to demonstrate to liberals that their real interest was in limiting autonomy not just for women and the children they might or might not have chosen to have, but also for the doctors who treat them, sometimes in the cruelest and most punitive ways imaginable.\n\nFollow this author Alyssa Rosenberg 's opinions Follow\n\nBut the Dobbs decision has also prompted some conservatives to show that their pro-life vision extends beyond unborn babies.\n\nLast January, the leaders of Americans United for Life \u2014 one of the organizations that threw their support to the child tax credit expansion \u2014 and Democrats for Life of America teamed up to propose that birth be made free for all American women, no matter their income or source of their insurance. A wide range of pro-life activists and intellectuals signed on to a call to get more parents and children excellent, affordable health care, paid parental leave for mothers and fathers, and better child care options for parents who work. And there is broader support for other family-friendly policies, too. In five relatively conservative Sun Belt states, two pollsters found widespread parental support for policy innovations ranging from property tax credits for parents to investments in after-school and summer care for school-aged children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurning those proposals \u2014 as well as many ambitious Democratic ideas to make family life easier \u2014 into policies will take cooperation, which itself depends on mutual trust and long-term commitment. It\u2019s helpful that groups such as Americans United for Life have waded into the child tax credit fight. But the organization could stand to let that broader perspective infuse their agenda as a whole. Its 2024 ranking of pro-life states doesn\u2019t use any pro-family policies such as state child tax credits or paid leave policies as scoring criteria.\n\nStill, when I spoke to Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.), who co-chairs the House Black Maternal Health Caucus, in January, she surprised me with her optimism about such relationship-building in Congress.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of discomfort with the idea that people are letting moms die,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to make sure that our Republican colleagues know that they are welcome in the Black Maternal Health Caucus, no matter why they\u2019re interested in joining.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnderwood accepts that some of them might come to the cause out of post-Roe political expediency, and that Republicans might not be able to embrace every proposal in the collection of bills she\u2019s gathered into her Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act. Instead, she\u2019s offering her Republican colleagues \u201ca la carte\u201d ways to be involved, as in her work with Republican Rep. Gus Bilirakis (Fla.) on a 2021 bill aimed at reducing maternal mortality among veterans. At the same time, she maintains her own commitment to protecting access to abortion and addressing the brain drain of obstetricians and gynecologists from states with restrictive antiabortion laws.\n\nEven if the expanded child tax credit becomes law, there will still be vast realms of policy for pro-choice and pro-life people to argue about."}

His Tesla stake is now around 13 percent, well below the nearly 22 percent he controlled when the compensation plan was struck. It has dwindled as he sold stock to cover tax bills and other financial obligations since his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in 2022. Meanwhile, Tesla \u2014 which rose like a rocket to become the world\u2019s most valuable automaker in 2020 \u2014 is encountering new challenges, including stagnating revenue from steep price cuts and the prospect of softening demand for its electric vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk faces more than financial losses.

Her latest book is \u201cSleepless: Unleashing the Subversive Power of the Night Self.\u201d I\u2019m closing my bedroom curtains when something catches my eye. I open the window and crane upward. A crescent moon hangs like a slice of ice among a diaspora of stars. I should try again to sleep. But the stars are too bright, too beautiful, flickering too wildly.\n\nSuddenly, I long to be outside, and I do something I have never done. I shunt a mattress out of the window to a narrow ledge of metal roof and make myself a bed \u2014 sheet, pillow, duvet. I crawl into it, unsure whether the roof will hold or the English rain will hold off. I lie back and look up.\n\nMy world shifts on its axis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNights spent outside are just some of the many nocturnal journeys I\u2019ve since taken. But they were the first to transform my relationship with sleeplessness. Of all the gifts of my insomnia \u2014 and there were many \u2014 the night sky was one of the most poignant and profound.\n\nIt showed me that all those wide-awake hours didn\u2019t have to be ruminative and anxious, that my sleepless self was not an enemy to be battled, sedated and despaired of. Instead, she could be my ally, a friendly teacher with wisdom to impart and experiences to share.\n\nMy penchant for open air nights might be unusual; my inability to sleep is not. In 2020, nearly 1 in 5 adults in the United States had trouble falling or staying asleep most nights. Up to half of U.S. adults experience insomnia from time to time. At the last count, 8 percent were taking prescription sleep medication and 11 percent were regularly forking out for sleep aids.\n\nBut while huge amounts of time and money have been spent exploring the sleeping and the sleep-deprived brain, virtually nothing has been invested in understanding the brain in its awake-at-night state.\n\nMy sleep began to fragment in my early 30s. Pregnant with my first child and working in a demanding corporate job, I pushed on, assuming the wakefulness would eventually pass. It didn\u2019t. After five years of night-feeds, sick toddlers and early morning conference calls, I quit the corporate job. Surely I would sleep now?\n\nShare this article Share\n\nI didn\u2019t. For another two decades I tried pills, oils, bedding, endless \u201csleep hygiene routines\u201d and the rest of what the $101 billion sleep industry has to offer. Eventually, wearily, I whiled away my nights listening to audiobooks and podcasts. Meanwhile, I panicked about imminent death, impending obesity, heart disease and dementia, and the criminal tendencies that, according to some experts, I\u2019d accrue.\n\nThree years ago, I snapped. A series of family deaths within a six-week period left me awake for hours every night. Audiobooks no longer soothed me.\n\nAs it happened, I was already researching women of the pre-sleeping-pill past. Many had welcomed the wee hours as a space for solitude, reflection and study. I called these women my \u201cnight spinners.\u201d\n\nTheir accounts prompted me to dig around in the corners of my own insomniac brain. Instead of seeking distraction from my churning thoughts, I tried to describe and name them. I sensed a subtly different sort of mind, less inclined to judge, more receptive, imaginative and fearful, with the ears of an elephant and the nostrils of a bloodhound. I called her my Night Self.\n\nWhen light drains from the sky, our bodies respond. Hormones rise and fall, dead skin cells are shed, we metabolize alcohol more slowly, our appetite shrinks, our blood pressure drops, our temperature falls, and much more besides. Come the evening hour, the darkness, wrote Virginia Woolf, \u201cwe are no longer quite ourselves.\u201d\n\nAs my own night journeys went on, and as my knowledge grew of the sleepless habits of past women, a handful of illuminating studies fell into my inbox. These hinted that insomnia and darkness were infinitely more nuanced than headlines suggested. Most serendipitous was a pioneering study on the \u201cMind after Midnight.\u201d A group of American sleep researchers found evidence that chimed with my own experiences and historical gleanings. The brain, it appears, resets for nocturne. Some regions go into partial hibernation, others bloom.\n\nNo one yet understands how or why, but at night many of us think, feel, behave in ways we might not during daylight. I, for one, am a little more reckless, with a yen for wistfulness and whimsy. This is how I found myself outside on that fateful starry night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI continued to head out when weather permitted. And \u2014 released from the anxious grip of the sleep industry and my own fears \u2014 I went further. I followed in the footsteps of the legions of women who once snatched time from the night to write, paint, pray, photograph or simply to observe moths, bats, glowworms.\n\nI discovered dozens of living women, too, who have made peace with their restive nights \u2014 who walk cities and forests alone, who swim on full moons or who make art, courtesy of their creative night brains."}

Then she taught it again.\n\nCHAPIN, S.C. \u2014 Mary Wood walked between the desks in her AP English Language and Composition classroom, handing out copies of the book she was already punished once for teaching. Twenty-six students, all but two of them White, looked down at Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d a memoir that dissects what it means to be Black in America \u2014 and which drew calls for Wood\u2019s firing when she tried to teach it last year in her mostly White, conservative town. Wood crossed to a lectern and placed her hands on either side of a turquoise notebook, open to two pages of bullet points explaining why she wanted to teach Coates\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cThat book that you guys have, it deals with racism,\u201d she said on a recent Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something with which you\u2019re unfamiliar. That you need to spend time to research to fully understand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWood stared at her class. She tried to make eye contact with every teenager. Anyone, she reminded herself, might be secretly recording her \u2014 or planning to report her.\n\nLast spring, two students in that year\u2019s English class had complained to the school board, alleging that \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d which contends racism is embedded in American society, made them ashamed to be White. That implied Wood had violated a state proviso forbidding teachers from causing students \u201cguilt, anguish or \u2026 psychological distress\u201d on account of their race.\n\nWithin days, Lexington-Richland School District Five officials forced Wood to stop teaching the book; later, they sent her a letter of reprimand. When the episode went public, it became a flash point in the national culture wars over how to teach race, racism and history: Politicians and pundits on the left and right alternately praised and vilified Wood, as local parents, residents and the county Republican Party demanded her punishment or termination. Wood, 47, who grew up in Chapin and attended the school where she teaches, felt like an outsider in her hometown.\n\nBut this year, she was determined things would be different.\n\nAs school policy demanded, she had gained permission to teach \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d from Chapin High School\u2019s new principal, a Black man. She had given every student\u2019s parents a chance to review her curriculum. She had offered to opt out any child whose family disliked Coates\u2019s book. And she had assigned a conservative voice pushing back on Coates.\n\nHer revised version of the lesson, Wood believed, complied with both the letter and the spirit of South Carolina\u2019s proviso. So now, despite everything, she was trying again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe told her class they would spend the next few days listening to a recording of the book, while each student took notes. After that, they would conduct independent research to develop their own arguments. They could agree with Coates, disagree with him or land in the middle.\n\n\u201cWhatever conclusion you arrive at is yours,\u201d she said. \u201cArguments are not supposed to be comfortable \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly not supposed to be filled with guilt.\u201d\n\nShe took a breath. \u201cThere is nothing,\u201d she added, \u201cto be ashamed of.\u201d\n\nShe readied herself to press play.\n\nWood and Tess Pratt, her English Department chair and good friend, decided over the summer that Wood had to teach \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d again.\n\nBoth teachers knew that most teens in Chapin \u2014 a wealthy town where the median income is above $100,000 and large homes line pretty Lake Murray \u2014 had never read anything like Coates\u2019s searing account of growing up Black in Baltimore. They had not spent their childhood, as Coates wrote he did, \u201cnaked \u2026 before all the guns, fists, knives, crack, rape, and disease.\u201d They had never memorized \u201ca list of prohibited blocks,\u201d unsafe due to guns and violence.\n\nPlus, both teachers believed the book, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, is superbly written: a master class in the deployment of rhetorical devices. There was no better way to teach children how to formulate their own arguments, they thought.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt teaches kids a different perspective, [it] teaches kids how to write well,\u201d Wood said in an interview. And \u201cit\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nStill, she worried she\u2019d face more complaints. Or lose her job. If she was fired, Wood \u2014 a University of North Carolina at Wilmington graduate who started teaching in the late 2000s \u2014 would have trouble paying the mortgage on her house.\n\nThen in early August, Wood found out her 16-year-old son, Summit, would be taking her AP Lang class. And she knew: She had to teach the book. Summit would be watching.\n\nThe year dawned with a new principal, Ed Davis, who requested meetings with every teacher. In her one-on-one, Wood brought up the book. Right away.\n\nDavis, whom the district declined to make available for an interview, said Wood could teach the book, she recalled. But he had advice.\n\nHe asked her to picture Chicago\u2019s Willis Tower, with its sky-high observation deck enclosed by a glass cage. Even people who are scared of heights know they are safe inside the glass, she remembered Davis saying. And that\u2019s what teachers must provide: a casing that protects kids when they\u2019re learning something difficult.\n\nHe also said that \u201cthe glass casing is for teachers,\u201d Wood recalled. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re teaching inside the standards and being professional, then you\u2019re not doing the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuperintendent Akil E. Ross wrote in a statement that the book has not been banned. Ross said teachers can assign material dealing with controversial topics, including Coates\u2019s book, so long as they \u201cexpose students to all sides \u2026 in a fair and unbiased manner\u201d and adhere to \u201ccontent standards.\u201d\n\nWood clung to the standards throughout the fall. She confined class discussion to the books she was teaching. She made fewer jokes.\n\nPartly, she was recalling what happened last school year. But she was also watching what was still unfolding.\n\nIn August, Lexington County Republicans suggested creating a 20-member commission of school board members, politicians and parents to study classroom materials for \u201crace-based instruction\u201d and \u201cvulgar materials.\u201d The proposal failed.\n\nIn September, a resident objected to fantasy novel \u201cA Court of Mist and Fury\u201d for its sexually explicit passages \u2014 part of a historic wave of schoolbook challenges nationwide. The school board ultimately banned five books in the fantasy series.\n\nThe next month, late on Halloween, school board member Catherine Huddle emailed Superintendent Ross with a request.\n\n\u201cI would like a list of all books purchased by or for Chapin High School English teachers\u201d since 2020-2021, she wrote, according to messages obtained by The Washington Post. She wanted to know who ordered and approved each book at Chapin High \u2014 no other schools, just Chapin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuddle said in an interview that she sent the query after a parent came to her distressed about two books in a teacher\u2019s classroom library. She never knew high school teachers stocked such libraries, she said, and wanted to find out how many and what sorts of books they were buying.\n\nShe was not searching for problematic titles, she said, and her request was unconnected to \u201cBetween the World and Me.\u201d Huddle declined to say whether she thinks Wood should teach the book.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that book again because it\u2019s related to personnel,\u201d she said. \u201cI am fine with the teaching of controversial topics \u2026 as long as it follows policy and process.\u201d\n\nThe superintendent ultimately sent Huddle logs of all \u201csupplies ... transactions\u201d for the years requested; Huddle said she reviewed invoices for book purchases and found nothing concerning, although she still worries classroom libraries amount to separate, uncatalogued books. But when the email became public in local news coverage, Pratt and Wood were incensed by what they saw as the questioning of their professional judgment \u2014 and worried that it proved scrutiny of their department was only intensifying.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nTwo weeks before she was slated to start teaching \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d Wood tapped out a reminder email to her principal.\n\n\u201cI announced to my class that anyone who wanted to could opt out if they so desired,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI DID include the author in my syllabus, so parents should be fully aware of materials which will be taught in AP Lang.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI just wanted to let you know the direction I am heading.\u201d\n\nJessica Odenwood stood when she heard her name called, clutched her printed speech and prepared to do something the 17-year-old had never done.\n\nIt was the night before Wood was slated to teach Coates\u2019s book again. But Jessica, a senior at Chapin High, was stuck on what happened last time.\n\nShe was one of the students in Wood\u2019s AP Lang class kept from reading \u201cBetween the World and Me.\u201d Back then, Jessica talked with friends about saying something. But, shy and averse to speechmaking, she kept quiet. In the months since, Jessica watched Wood stand up for her beliefs in speeches and interviews. She recalled what she read of \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d which she found poetic. She thought about how wrong it felt that she never finished the book.\n\nNow, at a late-January school board meeting, she had decided to speak her mind.\n\n\u201cAfter the books were taken, the classroom environment certainly did not feel safe,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cPublic education should never feel like a dystopian society.\u201d\n\nThis had been happening more since the controversy over Coates: Some in Chapin were denouncing what they saw as a movement to restrict diverse books and discussions of race. Among them was Ayanna Mayes, the Chapin High librarian. She began working at the school three years ago; in that time, she saw five books draw objections. First, \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue,\u201d about growing up Black and queer in Virginia and New Jersey; then the picture book \u201cBlack is a Rainbow Color\u201d; then Coates\u2019s book; then the fantasy novel; and, most recently, another children\u2019s book, \u201cThe Curse of King Tut\u2019s Tomb.\u201d\n\nMayes, who is Black, had always liked Chapin, which she found peaceful, filled with friendly people. But the challenges made her suspect the motives of everyone around her. When the fantasy novels were yanked, Mayes had to pull Chapin High\u2019s copies. One book was checked out. Mayes had to track down the student reading it and take the novel away.\n\nNow Mayes is preparing to speak at a board meeting this month. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be voiceless,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if support was building, so was resistance. The conservative X account \u201cLibs of Tik Tok\u201d later posted a clip of a student speech that January night \u2014 in which she thanked her teachers for providing \u201ca diverse education\u201d that spurred her to disagree with her pro-Trump father \u2014 and cited it as evidence schools are \u201cindoctrinating\u201d students. Meanwhile, negative comments about the meeting piled up on Facebook, with parents alleging Chapin High teachers, including Wood, are pushing left-wing political views on children.\n\n\u201cThis is appalling,\u201d posted Christina Carter, a mother of two in the Lexington-Richland district. \u201cI certainly hope that the state superintendent and board take action.\u201d\n\nCarter, 38, said in an interview that she wants a state investigation into Wood and Chapin High. She read about Wood\u2019s case before she and her family moved to Chapin this summer, attracted in part by the town\u2019s conservative values.\n\nWhen she arrived, Carter was shocked to learn Wood was still employed. She doesn\u2019t think Wood\u2019s teaching has a place in Chapin.\n\n\u201cIn some communities, there is lots of support for that type of material,\u201d Carter said. \u201cBut down here I would say there\u2019s a lot of opposition.\u201d\n\nWood\u2019s son, Summit, knew it firsthand.\n\nThings had gotten weird since his mother gained national attention for teaching \u201cBetween the World and Me.\u201d Some of Summit\u2019s friends told him Wood had broken the law, that she was a racist. Summit tackled one of them.\n\nThis year, very few people had mentioned it.\n\nNow, Summit knew, his mother was about to risk it all happening again. Before she did, he wanted to show her he understood why.\n\nAt the January board meeting, Summit stood up not long after Jessica. Wearing black slacks and a button-down white dress shirt, he pulled up a speech drafted on his iPhone Notes app.\n\nHe told the board it is wrong to shut down \u201cdiverse viewpoints.\u201d To shield students from harsh realities. He said reading complex literature teaches critical thinking.\n\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d he said, \u201cwas censored last year.\u201d\n\nHe went to bed that night wondering if she would be again.\n\nIn class the following Tuesday, before starting the audio recording of Coates\u2019s book, Wood opened her laptop and clicked to \u201cSystemic Racism: A Myth,\u201d published in 2021 by the Institute for Youth in Policy, whose website says it is \u201cdevoted to distributing nonpartisan, impartial and inquiry-led content.\u201d Wood found the institute, and its article, after hours of hunting online with Pratt.\n\n\u201cThe institution of policing seems systemically racist until the crime rates of African Americans are brought up,\u201d she read. \u201cDisparities of wealth and employment between white Americans and people of color is an understandable statistic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen she pressed play on a four-minute YouTube video: \u201cThe Unequal Opportunity Race,\u201d put out by the African American Policy Forum in 2010. Students watched as cartoon characters of different races sped around a track. White runners ran unimpeded, but competitors of color stumbled over roadblocks: A sudden thunder shower labeled \u201cDISCRIMINATION.\u201d A field of rocks headlined \u201cPOOR SCHOOLING.\u201d A deep hole titled \u201cUNDEREMPLOYMENT.\u201d\n\nSummit saw some classmates shoot each other looks, he later recalled.\n\nWood pushed ahead. She clicked a button, and Coates\u2019s voice filled the room: \u201cSon,\u201d he narrated, \u201clast Sunday the host of a popular news show asked me what it meant to lose my body.\u201d\n\nSummit, along with his classmates, opened his book to follow along. He pulled out a pencil and a loose sheet of lined paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first, he kept glancing around to see how his peers were reacting. But soon, he forgot to look: He was too interested in what Coates was saying about the American Dream.\n\nThat dream \u201cis perfect houses with nice lawns,\u201d Coates narrated. It is \u201cMemorial Day cookouts, block associations, and driveways \u2026 treehouses and the Cub Scouts.\u201d Summit thought: He could be describing Chapin.\n\n\u201cFor so long I have wanted to escape into the dream, to fold my country over my head like a blanket,\u201d Coates said. \u201cBut this has never been an option because the dream rests on our backs, the bedding made from our bodies.\u201d\n\nAt that sentence, Wood looked up. She saw Summit first, scribbling notes. She surveyed the rest of the class: Every single student was looking at their book. No one was on their phone."}

For more Style stories, click here End of carousel Ever since Swift was featured on national television rooting for Kelce at Arrowhead Stadium at the Chiefs-Chicago Bears game on Sept. 24, coverage of the relationship between the world\u2019s biggest pop star and the NFL\u2019s celebrity tight end continues to reach stratospheric heights. It\u2019s only destined to increase as the Chiefs head to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas on Feb. 11 after defeating the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC conference championship on Sunday. Swift attended nine Chiefs games this season, plus all three playoff matchups, and pulses quicken when the cameras catch a glimpse of her cheering from an elite suite. (Experts have done the math: Despite having a concert in Tokyo on Feb. 10, Swift could theoretically arrive in Vegas well before kickoff.)\n\nHowever, despite thousands of articles and photos and memes and TikTok fan edits, Swift and Kelce have pulled off the ultimate trick: For a famous couple that is so public-facing \u2014 he traveled to Argentina to watch one of her shows on the Eras Tour, she braved frigid temperatures for his games, they both showed up on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014 no one really knows anything about the time they spend together. Kelce spoke admirably about her in an interview for a November profile in WSJ, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s luxury magazine, and occasionally, ever so obliquely, refers to her on his top-rated podcast, while Swift revealed a bit more about their origin story in an interview she gave to Time when the magazine named her person of the year.\n\nThey are everywhere, very much on America\u2019s actively imaginative mind \u2014 two attractive and exceedingly admired 34-year-olds in the prime of their careers, with a combined net worth in the neighborhood of $1.14 billion. (He\u2019s the \u201c4\u201d in that figure.) It\u2019s beyond tantalizing to think of what they talk about, how they are together, what goes on when they\u2019re truly alone. Yet, of course, the personal details are scant.\n\nSuch frenzy reached its peak on Sunday in Baltimore, where Swift was captured on camera celebrating in a VIP suite as Kelce scored a touchdown and cheering \u201cTRAVIS!\u201d Afterward, she walked down to the field for the trophy presentation, where she stood between his parents, Ed and Donna Kelce. As soon as Kelce found Swift in the crowd, he threw his arms around her, and the two started kissing in front of the CBS cameras, which happily broadcast the images.\n\nIt\u2019s a wonder everyone around them didn\u2019t immediately faint. Instead, dozens of onlookers and reporters posted video of the interactions to social media, leaving Swift fans in shambles \u2014 especially because, for the first time, they could hear the two having an actual conversation. \u201cHow about that one, huh?!\u201d Kelce exclaimed, as Swift leaned on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that,\u201d Swift beamed. Kelce went over to hug his father, then turned back to Swift: \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Sweetie? Where were you guys at?\u201d Swift pointed to a suite in the distance. \u201cIt was the best view ever, it was insane,\u201d Swift said, then grinned at him again. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d They started hugging and kissing again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA revealing back-and-forth? Not particularly \u2014 except the fact that Kelce calls her \u201cSweetie,\u201d a tidbit that sent Swifties reeling, even those who recognize the conundrum that, theoretically, they should respect the couple\u2019s privacy, and they don\u2019t actually know these two. (In another video, he called her \u201cTay,\u201d and Swifties spiraled further.)\n\nSwift has spent her 17-year career making her fans feel like her friends, and now they want to know it all. They are riveted. And there\u2019s only so much lack of information they can take.\n\nMichalik, who has covered entertainment for years working in radio, calls herself a \u201cmild Swiftie\u201d and more of a general pop culture fan when it comes to her fascination with Swift and Kelce. She is consumed with questions, especially when Swift travels to Kansas City: Does Kelce drive to the tarmac to greet her private jet? Does she then jump into his arms, like contestants do on \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d? Or does a security detail drive her to his house? Then does she knock? Does she ring the doorbell? Does her security sit outside? Where\u2019s her assistant? Is her assistant in the house?\n\nWhen Michalik posited some of these questions on TikTok, commenters admitted that they wondered similar things, confessing, \u201cI want them to have privacy but I want to watch every moment,\u201d and, \u201cI want them to be left alone but yet I want to know 7000% of everything that happens,\u201d and, \u201cThis is my Roman Empire. I think about this too.\u201d\n\nAttempts to analyze Swift\u2019s personal life can backfire. A recent 4,700-word New York Times opinion piece speculated about Swift\u2019s sexuality and whether she\u2019s closeted, drawing enormous backlash and a reprimand via CNN from an anonymous source in Swift\u2019s camp, who called it \u201cinvasive, untrue, and inappropriate.\u201d Yet, on every social media platform, her fans spend hours fantasizing about what goes on in her world, and it only magnifies as her happiness with Kelce becomes more evident.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember they\u2019re real people, but also, like \u2014 Taylor\u2019s an entity at this point. And Travis has maintained such a normal life for so long, and now all of a sudden he\u2019s part of this phenomenon,\u201d Michalik said in an interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has theories about why people are so captivated, including the fact that they are the rare superstar couple from different orbits (like the U.S. version of Posh and Becks) and women everywhere can relate to \u201cthe American Dream\u201d of dating the handsome football player. Michalik referenced a January essay from Los Angeles Times columnist Amy Kaufman, who explored her own unexpected \u201cobsession\u201d with Swift and Kelce\u2019s relationship. Kaufman traced it back to her experiences in high school, where everyone learns early on to pay attention to the quarterbacks and cheerleaders (and, as Swift would say, the girls on the bleachers) and their comparable analogues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just fun to have the discourse about it,\u201d Michalik said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great pop culture poetic moment.\u201d\n\nIn a fringier area of the national psyche, the Swift-Kelce romance is not seen as poetry but as a sham, according to conservative pundits and others floating conspiracy theories, who, like fans, have also let their imaginations run wild in the absence of facts: They\u2019re not really in love! The NFL is rigged! It\u2019s all a big scheme to reelect President Biden! Disbelief becomes part of the fantasy.\n\n\u201cHopefully everybody realizes that we\u2019re just two people in a relationship supporting each other and having fun with it, man,\u201d Kelce told ESPN host Pat McAfee on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than that. How much the world wants to paint the picture and make us the enemy, we just have fun with it, and we enjoy every single bit of it.\u201d\n\nSo what do we know?\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAs fans can recite by heart, this all started in late July on \u201cNew Heights,\u201d the podcast Kelce hosts with his brother, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce. During a promo segment for ticketing platform SeatGeek, Travis shared that he tried (and failed) to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number on it at her Eras Tour stop in Kansas City. He later told WSJ that he had \u201csomebody playing Cupid\u201d who then prompted Swift to reach out. Swift confirmed to Time that they started spending time together shortly after Kelce \u201cvery adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 12, digital news start-up the Messenger broke the story, reporting that Swift and Kelce were \u201cquietly hanging out\u201d and recently saw each other in New York City.\n\n\u201cThey hadn\u2019t been spotted out together, there were no photographs or anything,\u201d said entertainment editor Lanae Brody, who co-bylined the piece with senior writer Christina Dugan Ramirez. The story quickly picked up momentum. \u201cTo see the fan excitement because people love Travis and people love Taylor, ... it was really just an exciting thing to watch.\u201d (On Wednesday, the Messenger\u2019s founder told employees that the site was shutting down.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor anyone who doubted the scoop, the \u201cI told you so\u201d arrived nearly two weeks later, when Swift made a surprise appearance at the Bears-Chiefs game, wearing a red Chiefs jacket that matched her signature red lipstick. Richie Zyontz, Fox NFL lead producer, later wrote in a blog post that the network heard rumblings that Swift might show up and asked her record label for permission to use her music during the game. The label said absolutely not.\n\nUndeterred, when Fox confirmed the rumors hours before kickoff, camera operators mapped out the location of Kelce\u2019s guest suite and were ready for every shot of Swift cheering. The internet went wild and virtually ignored the game, which the Chiefs won, 41-10. \u201cA blowout was overshadowed by a social phenomenon,\u201d Zyontz wrote. (In her Time interview, Swift said that she and Kelce were \u201calready a couple\u201d at that point.)\n\nOver the next several months, Swift kept traveling to Chiefs matchups alongside her family and celebrity friends and some NFL wives, most notably Brittany Mahomes. The NFL, as giddy as anyone else about all this, started sneaking Swift lyric references into on-screen graphics and featuring her frequently on TV. Gradually, Swift and Kelce showed more public displays of affection, holding hands as they departed stadiums.\n\nAs is typical in high-octane celeb romances, anonymous sources started chatting to tabloids and websites, making sure to emphasize that Swift and Kelce were focused on their careers but that the relationship was \u201cquickly turning more serious.\u201d Swift fans swooned online, especially about how Kelce \u2014 unlike some of Swift\u2019s previous boyfriends \u2014 appeared unfazed by the extreme scrutiny, as he casually answered questions in NFL news conferences and joked on his podcast about all the attention.\n\nThen, a day cemented in Swiftie history: In the middle of his bye week, on Nov. 11, Kelce attended the second of Swift\u2019s three sold-out stadium shows in Buenos Aires. He stood next to her father in the VIP tent, grinning and dancing to the music. During her final song, \u201cKarma,\u201d Swift laughed as she changed a lyric from, \u201cKarma is the guy on the screen,\u201d to, \u201cKarma is the guy on the Chiefs.\u201d If that didn\u2019t send fans into enough of a frenzy, when the concert ended, she raced off the stage and straight into Kelce\u2019s arms, where they kissed in front of everyone.\n\n\u201cIt was like a Swiftie holiday,\u201d said Kristen, a 25-year-old fan from Daytona Beach, Fla., who was watching a live stream of the concert on social media and immediately ran to her 40-person Swiftie group chat that was \u201cfreaking out\u201d about what they just witnessed.\n\nKristen spoke on the condition that only her first name be used because of professional reasons; she\u2019s aware that not everyone understands being so personally invested in a celebrity. For Kristen and her group chat, it was thrilling to see Swift act like a regular person having a great time with her boyfriend. \u201cYou can tell Taylor is just radiating happiness. She feels like a big sister to me, and seeing her so happy ... is so exciting.\u201d\n\nEngagement rumors naturally started with a vengeance over the holidays. Several tabloid stories shot down these whispers, noting that Swift will be traveling the globe when the Eras Tour starts back up in February in Japan and Australia, and warned everyone to chill. In early January, the Messenger reported, \u201cthere are still no plans for an engagement. It\u2019s still new and they\u2019re happy and still getting to know each other.\u201d\n\nBesides the public updates, of course, we still don\u2019t know much \u2014 and the scarcity of details means each new one is treated like a precious morsel of information.\n\nEver since pop culture TikTok creator Jessica Golich started posting a steady stream of videos about Swift (essentially becoming the \u201cSwiftie news girl,\u201d she said), people have been flooding her direct messages with grainy photos of Swift and Kelce at various bars and restaurants as fans beg her for more information.\n\n\u201cEvery single time she goes out, or she steps outside for two seconds, it\u2019s, \u2018Where are the posts?!\u2019\u201d Golich said of the demand for content of the couple. While Golich posts photos from official news sources or ones that have already gone viral, she holds back on publishing much of what people send her. There\u2019s an extreme appetite for the behind-the-scenes of Swift and Kelce in Kansas City, she said, but she wants to try to conserve their privacy as they enjoy everyday activities.\n\n\u201cI mean, I feel like everybody in life deserves an epic love story. And if anybody deserves the happy ending fairy tale from a public figure standpoint, it\u2019s Taylor,\u201d Golich said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKansas City Realtor Alex Owens was doing some last-minute shopping at Trader Joe\u2019s on that November day when she noticed Kelce about 10 feet away from her. She filmed a few seconds of footage and posted to Instagram, thinking her friends would get a kick out of it. Thanks to the Swift of it all, the video has been viewed about 3.5 million times.\n\nOwens said that as soon as Kelce walked out of the store, everyone \u201cexploded\u201d and one cashier burst into tears; until then, the customers let him shop in peace. Although there\u2019s obviously an intense curiosity about Swift and Kelce when they are out and about, people like to give them their space, Owens said, which is how Kansas City residents typically act when they see any of their high-profile athletes around town.\n\n\u201cMost people just let them be,\u201d Owens said. \u201cKansas City is very Midwestern hospitality, and we understand that everybody outside their jobs is just normal \u2014 even though we might be kind of obsessed with them.\u201d\n\nThe Swifties also try to play it cool when they can, but after the pile of videos from the field at M&T Bank Stadium on Sunday, forget it. Mere hours after the game, every angle of the footage was dissected and lip-readers were called into action (Did they both say, \u201cI love you\u201d?) as others zoomed in on Swift\u2019s jewelry: a red jersey-shaped ring that bore Kelce\u2019s number, 87, and the glimpse of a sparkling bracelet under the sleeve of her red sweater that read \u201cTNT.\u201d (For Taylor \u2019N\u2019 Travis, of course.)"}

Then they\u2019ll turn their attention to an even bigger issue: What to do about China?\n\nTuvalu is one of only three Pacific Island nations that still recognize Taiwan, following Nauru\u2019s diplomatic swing to China last month. But that could change following last week\u2019s election, when Tuvalu\u2019s pro-Taiwan prime minister surprisingly lost his seat.\n\nSeve Paeniu, the more pro-China finance minister, was not only reelected but also has emerged as one of the top contenders to become prime minister.\n\nPaeniu told The Washington Post he was open to recognizing China \u2014 a move that would leave the self-governing island of Taiwan with just two allies in the Pacific \u2014 Palau and the Marshall Islands \u2014 and fewer than a dozen worldwide.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, it boils down to whichever country \u2026 offers the greatest support to achieving Tuvalu\u2019s development priorities and aspirations,\u201d Paeniu said. \u201cThe whole relationship will need to be reviewed and assessed carefully before arriving at an informed decision on the switch.\u201d\n\nAs China vies with the United States for power and influence in the Pacific, it has tirelessly tried to pry allies away from Taiwan by many means \u2014 chief among them, money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has offered much-needed funds to struggling island nations like Nauru, and allegedly doled out envelopes of cash to officials \u2014 an accusation Beijing denies. China has approached Pacific politicians as they travel overseas, inviting some to lunch and surveilling others. Two Pacific leaders said Chinese officials called to berate them so often that they changed their numbers.\n\n\u201cChina sees an opportunity,\u201d said Surangel Whipps Jr., the president of Palau, one of Taiwan\u2019s two other remaining allies in the Pacific, who changed his number after calls from a Chinese official turned angry. Whipps said he and his country have come under intense pressure from Beijing ahead of an election this November.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to get the message across: Join us, and you\u2019ll be better off,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd it is tempting when you\u2019re hit with covid, when you have a lot of debt, when your country is up against the wall and China says we should do all of this for you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt is all part of Beijing\u2019s decades-long campaign to intimidate Taiwan, which it claims is part of China, that has ramped up under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. He recently said that China\u2019s rule over the island is \u201cinevitable.\u201d Beijing has pushed countries to recognize China, not Taiwan, as a way to bolster its claims and, by picking off its allies, China isolates Taiwan on the international stage.\n\nChinese officials appear to be redoubling these efforts after Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, a man Beijing considers a dangerous separatist, was elected the next president of Taiwan.\n\nNauru\u2019s surprise switch\n\nTwo days after Lai\u2019s election, Nauru gave Taiwan two hours\u2019 notice that it was ending relations with Taipei \u201ceffective immediately\u201d and establishing ties with Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs recently as November, Nauru and Taiwan were discussing new airline routes. That month, Nauru officials met with Taiwan and its other Pacific allies on the sidelines of a summit in the Cook Islands. There was no sign Nauru was about to switch. \u201cI thought everything was great,\u201d said Whipps, who was at the meeting.\n\nBut by year\u2019s end, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu was hearing otherwise. Nauru\u2019s foreign minister, Lionel Aingimea, told him the island was under \u201clots of financial pressure\u201d because of a drop in funding from Australia for an offshore refugee processing center, Wu said.\n\nWu offered to speak with the United States and Australia about making up the shortfall, but in the background China was making moves.\n\nWu soon learned that Beijing was offering Nauru a deal worth more than $100 million \u2014 more than half of Nauru\u2019s 2023-24 budget and more than 10 times what Taiwan gave Nauru annually in project-based aid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were told by a Nauru friend \u2026 that China promised them that the aid is unlimited \u2014 whatever they requested,\u201d Wu said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAingimea said last month\u2019s diplomatic switch was because China was better able to help Nauru. \u201cTo say it\u2019s a question of dollars is absolutely an insult to us,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s about our development strategy.\u201d\n\nBeijing had agreed to infrastructure projects including a sports stadium, schools, hospitals and office complexes, as well as plans to move vulnerable coastal buildings to higher ground and to extend the life of aging phosphate mines.\n\nThe discussions with China began more than a year ago, Aingimea said. Nauru never told Taipei it was thinking of switching recognition but it mentioned \u201cgeopolitical pressures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey should have stepped up and said they would come and help,\u201d Aingimea said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a beggar nation that goes around asking people with our hands out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the success with Nauru, Chinese officials have since promised to lure away more of Taiwan\u2019s remaining allies \u2014 11 countries, many of them small, and the Holy See. The head of the diplomatic team overseeing the reopening of China\u2019s Embassy in Nauru last week suggested the remaining three Pacific nations would soon switch.\n\n\u201cChina has already established diplomatic ties with 10 Pacific countries \u2014 Nauru was the 11th and I\u2019m confident it won\u2019t be the last,\u201d Wang Xuguang told Chinese state media.\n\nThe competition over allies also illustrates China\u2019s bid for influence in regions typically under Western sway.\n\n\u201cIn the past, Beijing\u2019s focus was mainly Taiwan itself,\u201d said Lu Yeh-chung, a professor of diplomacy at the National Chengchi University in Taipei. \u201cNow they\u2019ve shown they intend to compete with the United States and Australia by snatching Taiwan\u2019s allies in the South Pacific.\u201d\n\nNauru\u2019s recognition switch also points to a new effort by Beijing to make the one-China principle \u2014 which maintains that Taiwan is part of China \u2014 an accepted fact. Announcing its switch and adherence to the one-China principle, Nauru described it as \u201cin line\u201d with a United Nations resolution in 1971 that established Beijing as the sole representative of China to the body. By linking the two, Beijing is \u201csneaking the idea that Taiwan is part of China into the rules-based international order,\u201d Lu said.\n\nWhat next for Tuvalu?\n\nTuvalu\u2019s newly elected officials are in the process of choosing who will become prime minister. Apart from Paeniu, most of the front-runners have publicly dismissed the idea of switching ties to Beijing. Opposition leader Enele Sopoaga, who retained his place in parliament, said in December that he would \u201cnever\u201d side with China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaiwan provides Tuvalu around $12 million per year in direct budgetary support, along with funds for projects including roughly $10 million for a proposed new parliament building, said Taiwan\u2019s ambassador to Tuvalu, Andrew Lin.\n\nAll the while, China has been targeting Tuvalu officials.\n\nSimon Kofe, a member of parliament who was reelected last week, said he was approached by Chinese officials during a trip to Fiji, which has diplomatic ties with Beijing, in 2022, when he was Tuvalu\u2019s foreign affairs minister. The officials offered a meeting with the Chinese ambassador, but Kofe declined. \u201cIf it\u2019s happened to me, then it definitely is happening to others,\u201d Kofe said.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s other Pacific allies \u2014 Palau and the Marshall Islands \u2014 have security agreements, called compacts of free association with the United States, that make a switch less likely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarshallese President Hilda Heine said her nation still had strong ties to Taiwan and was not under Chinese pressure to switch \u201cat the moment.\u201d\n\nBut Whipps said Palau\u2019s close U.S. relationship made it even more of a target for China: \u201cThey are very interested in flipping a compact country.\u201d\n\nPalau won\u2019t switch while he is president, Whipps said. But he feared for what would happen if someone else were elected.\n\n\u201cWe know that if we all sever ties with Taiwan, that just gives China a green light to take over Taiwan,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a small island like us, that is kind of scary.\u201d"}

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight The new figures for his legal spending were outlined in campaign disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday night. Trump\u2019s advisers have said the money that is being spent on legal expenses is not only for Trump\u2019s defense, but also for the lawyer fees for some of his advisers and associates. Here are a few early takeaways from the new filings:\n\nTrump\u2019s mounting legal bills\n\nTwo of Trump\u2019s committees, Save America leadership PAC and the Make America Great Again PAC, spent $55.6 million on legal bills in 2023, including $29.9 million in the second half of the year, according to the new reports released Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump campaign had more than $33 million in cash on hand at the end of last year after raising more than $19 million in the fourth quarter. Save America leadership PAC had about $5.1 million in cash on hand at the end of the year. Across all of his committees, Trump had a war chest of over $70 million at the end of the year, a total that includes cash available to his allied super PAC, MAGA Inc.\n\nTrump has raised most of his campaign funds from small-dollar donors. In the fine print of his solicitations, Trump\u2019s joint fundraising committee notes that about 90 cents of each dollar is diverted to his campaign committee and 10 cents is diverted to the Save America leadership PAC.\n\nSave America, a political action committee that the former president formed as he raised money from his donors while falsely claiming that the 2020 election was fraudulent, has served as his main vehicle to pay legal bills. Trump\u2019s advisers have said that he is helping to pay lawyers\u2019 fees for dozens of people to prevent their \u201cfinancial ruin,\u201d as he argues that he is the victim of a \u201cweaponized\u201d justice system. Small amounts of the legal payments could be directed for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign or for routine legal expenditures incurred for operational purposes, but usually that\u2019s a small percent of total expenditures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe legal spending peaked in July, when special counsel Jack Smith issued a superseding indictment in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, and immediately before Trump\u2019s indictment on Aug. 1 in a Georgia election interference case. Trump-supporting PACs paid $6.6 million to dozens of legal firms that month.\n\nThe Save America account had about $100 million at the beginning of 2022. When the funds in the Save America account were nearly depleted last year, operatives for Trump began transferring money among his different committees, including some that were left over from his 2020 presidential campaign. One of those committees is the Make America Great Again PAC. That committee received a total of $11.8 million from Save America in multiple transfers across 2023 and has spent the sum almost entirely on legal fees.\n\nAt the outset of his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump transferred $60 million to the main super PAC associated with his reelection effort, MAGA Inc. As a super PAC, the committee can raise unlimited sums to spend on advertising and other efforts to support Trump\u2019s candidacy. But some of that money has since been transferred back to Save America in an apparent effort to ease its cash crunch as his legal bills grow. As of Wednesday\u2019s filing, $42.5 million had been refunded from MAGA Inc. to Save America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Patriot Legal Defense Fund, a fund focusing on paying for lawyers for Trump associates, submitted a new filing with the Internal Revenue Service that showed $221,000 in payments to Brand Woodward Law in December. The firm has represented Trump associates including Waltine \u201cWalt\u201d Nauta and Dan Scavino. The fund also paid law firm Gibson Dunn and Crutcher $150,000 for \u201cservices rendered.\u201d A filing in December showed that the fund spent $18,136 to host a banquet at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s Florida residence and private club.\n\nFunding dried up for DeSantis super PAC as it spent $130 million\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his allied committees were initially a fundraising juggernaut that posed a serious threat to the Trump campaign. But as his candidacy faded last fall in the midst of a messy power struggle within his orbit, his rival former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley got a fresh look from donors who had previously given to DeSantis and some donors who had stayed on the sidelines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FEC reports filed on Wednesday from the campaign illustrate how difficult it might have been for him to carry on if he had not dropped out after the Iowa caucuses.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nNever Back Down, the super PAC funding much of DeSantis\u2019s operation, took in $14.5 million in the second half of 2023 \u2014 far less than officials had hoped for after amassing some $130 million in the first half of the year. In August, super PAC\u2019s officials asked donors to help them raise $50 million more by the end of 2023 and another $50 million by March.\n\nNever Back Down spent more than $130 million throughout 2023, ending the year with less than $15 million in cash on hand. About $10 million was transferred late in the race to a new super PAC; the DeSantis campaign began to route donors there instead.\n\nMeanwhile, DeSantis\u2019s campaign \u2014 which unlike a super PAC is subject to contribution limits \u2014 brought in about $6.7 million in the fourth quarter and spent $9.3 million. It ended the year with close to $10 million cash on hand \u2014 but much of that was not available for the primary fight that he had hoped to wage against Trump and Haley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeSantis continued to fly private even as his operation tried to save money, leaning on Never Back Down to underwrite some of his travel. For a time, the super PAC and the campaign both paid a company called N2024D to cover some private plane costs. In the fall, another transportation company began to receive travel payments from both the campaign and Never Back Down. The DeSantis campaign paid more than a half-million dollars to TMFB, a Florida-based company formed last June, with documents naming Craig Mateer, a DeSantis appointee; the super PAC paid TMFB more than a quarter million.\n\nHaley\u2019s deep-pocketed donors\n\nIn the second half of 2023, as Haley was surging in national polls and the key early state of New Hampshire, her campaign and the allied super PAC known as SFA Fund Inc. received a major infusion of cash from deep-pocketed donors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer campaign raised more than $17 million in the fourth quarter and had $14.1 million in cash on hand at the end of the year.\n\nHer backers included some of the biggest megadonors to the GOP, including billionaire hedge-fund manager Paul Singer and Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, who both donated $5 million to SFA Inc. in the fourth quarter. As she touted her strong support for Israel, Haley also drew major support from some of the most prominent Jewish donors in the country, including Jan Koum, the WhatsApp founder who gave $5 million to the Haley super PAC last year. Other major donors to her effort included insurance executive Pat Ryan and philanthropist Shirley Ryan, who gave a total of $5 million to the super PAC; Arkansas-based investment banker Warren Stephens, who gave more than $2 million; and California-based investor Timothy Draper, who donated $1 million, according to the fourth-quarter reports.\n\nSFA Fund showed a notable burn rate between July and December of last year, spending $63.7 million and ending the year with about $3.5 million in cash on hand. The group\u2019s advisers have said they are raising money at a fast clip this year and will be able to help Haley compete through the coming contests.\n\nBiden showed a cash advantage at year\u2019s end\n\nThe Biden For President committee raised $33 million in the third quarter and ended the year with $45.9 million in cash on hand, besting the Trump campaign. Unlike Trump, President Biden has not been forced to spend down his campaign cash in a competitive primary, as he has faced only nominal opposition from candidates such as Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and author Marianne Williamson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Biden and Trump are raising money through their joint fundraising committees. The Biden Victory Fund reported more than $69 million in contributions in the fourth quarter alone, while the Trump Save America joint fundraising committee raised more than $75 million in the second half of the year.\n\nThe Biden Action Fund \u2014 a joint effort between the Biden campaign, the Democratic National Committee and state committees \u2014 raised over $5 million in the second half of the year. Together, Biden\u2019s committees and the DNC ended the year with a war chest of $117 million. (The Biden Action Fund had $11 million in cash on hand at the end of the year, while the Biden Victory Fund had $37.5 million left over.)\n\nWhile Democrats are optimistic about their general-election prospects based on their current cash-on-hand advantage, Trump will have the opportunity to tap into a new pool of donations if and when he signs certain fundraising agreements with the Republican National Committee and state committees. TJ Ducklo, senior adviser for communications on the Biden campaign, argued in a statement late Wednesday that while Trump \u201clights money on fire\u201d paying his expenses, the Biden-Harris campaign \u201cis hard at work talking to the voters who will decide this election and building the campaign infrastructure to win in November.\u201d\n\nThe Trump team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on their filings."}

Choose your plan ArrowRight Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said last week that a joint Egyptian-Japanese archaeological mission will study, document and restore granite blocks that once made up the exterior of the pyramid of Menkaure, the smallest of the three major pyramids.\n\nIn videos posted on Facebook, Mostafa Waziry, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said that the pyramid \u2014 built around 2490 B.C. \u2014 was the only one of the country\u2019s 124 or so pyramids to have a granite external cladding. It has \u201cfive or six layers\u201d of granite blocks, but originally had 16 or more, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaziry said the restoration work would take at least three years and described it as the \u201cproject of the century.\u201d\n\nBut many observers did not share in the hype. The videos, which showed workers digging up blocks at the base of the pyramid, drew sharp criticism online and fueled concerns from experts that the attempt at restoration was more akin to desecration.\n\nOne commenter asked, \u201cHow can you think it\u2019s your job to alter the pyramid after 4,500 years?\u201d Another pleaded, \u201cPlease respect the past, do not make Disneyland from ancient legacy.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Menkaure pyramid is a part of a UNESCO World Heritage site, UNESCO said in an email that it was unaware of the project and had \u201cwritten to the Egyptian authorities to ask them for more information.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWaziry and the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement shared by Monica Hanna, an archaeologist and Egyptologist at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, a group of archaeologists called the project \u201centirely unscientific\u201d and accused those behind it of chasing publicity over legitimate archaeological inquiry. They stressed that documentation cannot occur at the same time as the excavation shown in the video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProceeding with the project \u201cis tantamount to tampering with Egyptian antiquities and undermining its antiquity and history,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt listed several concerns, including that \u201cno archaeological or historical evidence exists\u201d as to the blocks\u2019 original position on the pyramid, and asserts that they did not fall from it \u201cbut were left by the pyramid\u2019s workmen as unfinished business.\u201d Trying to refine the crude blocks left around the pyramid and use them as cladding would be \u201cblatant interference with the work of the ancient Egyptians,\u201d the statement said.\n\nKathlyn Cooney, a professor of Egyptian art and architecture at the UCLA, pointed to the difference between conservation, which \u201cpreserves an object in the state it is in,\u201d and restoration, which \u201cimproves it, changes it, beautifies it\u201d \u2014 and \u201cshould be avoided at all costs.\u201d\n\nShe said in an email that the facade of the Menkaure pyramid was left unfinished, which \u201cteaches us about his kingship [and] the political affairs of the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy putting blocks back, we will destroy all that data,\u201d Cooney said. \u201cAnd for what?

We agreed it was a shame that thoughtless, careless people procreate without intention, without marriage and without adequate income when it is so easy to prevent.

You were judging women who take the exact path Jennifer took as \u201cthoughtless, careless people.\u201d You weren\u2019t not talking about her, for sure.

I know from decades of personal experience that where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way to not procreate. Maybe if we attached more stigma to thoughtless, careless reproduction, people would think twice before doing it. And burdening the rest of us with all the related ills.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: Actually, no, the writer does not have a point. And I\u2019ve even said myself, over and over, that the time to have a baby is when people want a child and are prepared to care for one. That can be true at the same time it\u2019s true that stigmatizing women is judgmental.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn individual choice does not track one-to-one with a societal outcome. So talking about a Jennifer or a Whoever as being irresponsible, audibly in a social situation, is very different from saying generally that it\u2019s better for people to procreate with intention. Which it is. Duh.\n\nWhen the individual choice is made, then it\u2019s time to shut up the judgy voice and root for the humans involved. Shaming people out of behaviors? Been there, tried that, with many traumas and no progress. The teen birthrate since 1991 has plunged, amid less stigma.

Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight Then came one minivan after another, which he used to shuttle their kids to sports games and church until one day they were grown and out of the house, the friend said. Gill, a 56-year-old trade association executive, bought his second Jeep a few months ago, directly from the dealership this time, a consolation for empty-nesting. He told his friends all about it, how its gray exterior shined.\n\nEarly Monday evening, he drove that Jeep to pick up Kristina, now his wife, at her law office in downtown Washington. He called her to say he was waiting downstairs. She replied that she was on her way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen a man climbed into Gill\u2019s Jeep and shot him.\n\nMichael \u201cMike\u201d Gill was one of two people shot in a spate of carjackings in D.C. and suburban Maryland that began Monday and went on overnight \u2014 a rampage that authorities said was carried out by one man, who was killed by police a few hours before dawn Tuesday. On Wednesday, Gill remained hospitalized in critical condition. The other shooting victim, Alberto Vasquez Jr., a 35-year-old who loved reading to his young daughters, died from his wound.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a rare combination of personal humility and amazing effectiveness,\u201d said Chris Giancarlo, a former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission who was Gill\u2019s boss for several years there. Giancarlo, a close friend of Gill\u2019s who shared the story about the Jeeps, added: \u201cHe really is one of the more remarkable people of everybody I\u2019ve had the pleasure to work with.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man identified by authorities as the carjacker, Artell Cunningham, 28, of Suitland, Md., committed or attempted to commit at least four carjackings in addition to the attack on Gill, according to police. They said he also fired shots at two occupied police vehicles in separate locations while officers from several departments urgently searched for him for hours.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said they believe Cunningham was in the throes of a psychiatric crisis when the crimes occurred.\n\n\u201cIt was a mental thing going on with him,\u201d said a woman who answered the phone at a residence listed as the home of Cunningham\u2019s mother. \u201cThey\u2019re investigating it,\u201d she said, and declined to comment further.\n\nAccording to a D.C. police affidavit filed in court, Cunningham threatened to kill officers in 2021 after they encountered him wandering in the hallway of an apartment building and trying to enter an apartment where his siblings were. He was not prosecuted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she arrived downstairs from her office, Gill\u2019s wife, Kristina, found him sprawled on the sidewalk in the 900 block of K Street NW, blood pooling around his head and one foot still in the Jeep. She held his hand until the ambulance arrived.\n\nAbout a mile away and less than two hours later, Erin Catherall, 26, parked her white Mercedes-Benz in front of her friend\u2019s residence in Northeast Washington. She popped open the trunk to retrieve a duffle bag full of clothing she planned to give away. Suddenly, a man dressed in all black ran up to her, standing uncomfortably close near 5th and K streets NE.\n\n\u201cCan I get your car keys, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked, according to Catherall.\n\nHe repeated the request several times, she said, while lifting his shirt to show a silver-colored handgun tucked in his waistband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first, Catherall, who works as a consultant and has lived in D.C. for three years, said the juxtaposition of his seemingly benign question against the threat of his gun left her dumbstruck. \u201cHe was oddly kind of polite,\u201d she said. \u201cI was very confused about what he initially wanted.\u201d\n\nShe said the assailant turned to her friend, who was on the sidewalk, and flashed the gun at her as well. Catherall said she was holding her car keys in her hand. Then she and her friend ran and called out for help, the car trunk still open.\n\nCunningham ran off, leaving the vehicle, police said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the next day that Catherall realized that 10 minutes later and five blocks away, the same man had carjacked someone else \u2014 Vasquez, who was fatally shot.\n\nVasquez\u2019s father, Jacob Walker, 52, said he was told that Vasquez had handed over his keys before Cunningham shot him. That didn\u2019t surprise him, Walker said, because he knew his son was not a fighter. Plus, Vasquez was just learning to walk again after a bad car crash in 2022. \u201cI wonder if that is why he didn\u2019t run away from the shooter,\u201d Walker said.\n\nVasquez had lived in the D.C. area since he was 11. Walker described him as a boy who loved sports, who was crowned homecoming king in high school, and who grew into a man devoted to his family and two daughters, ages 10 and 7. Walker said the family has not yet told the girls what happened to their dad. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do the best we can.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn all of this, I have been thinking of the impact that it has on everyone. Not only my family, but the shooter\u2019s family, and the other gentleman\u2019s family, the one that is clinging to his life,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThere is also the police officers who have to deliver the news. \u2026 We are normalizing. That should not be normal.\u201d\n\nLess than three hours after Vasquez was slain near the NoMa-Gallaudet Metro station, Cunningham carjacked a ride-hailing driver in Takoma Park in Montgomery County, stealing a Toyota Camry, police said. Then he attacked the driver of a Nissan Rogue in Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s University Park area.\n\nAuthorities said that about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, someone in a Nissan shot at a Maryland State Police cruiser stopped at the scene of a disabled vehicle along southbound Interstate 95 at Route 198. The trooper was climbing out of the cruiser when a bullet struck its hood. He was not injured. A half-hour later, according to D.C. police, the Nissan was used in a drive-by shooting of a marked D.C. police cruiser on D.C. 295 at Exit 1. At least one bullet struck the driver\u2019s-side door, police said. The officer was not hurt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 4:30 a.m., police said they located the Nissan, with no one in it, on Annapolis Road in the New Carrollton area of Prince George\u2019s County. While officers were looking for the driver, a man walked up to them and displayed two firearms, according to Thomas Lester, a spokesman for the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s Office. Lester said both officers fired at the man, later identified as Cunningham, who was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s Office identified the officers who shot Cunningham as Byron Purnell, a sergeant with six years on the force, and Carlos Batenga, a corporal who they said has \u201ca total of 5 years of law enforcement experience.\u201d\n\nEfforts to reach them for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nOn Wednesday, as word of Gill\u2019s grave condition circulated among his friends in Washington, they described him fondly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Bennett, a former chairman of the D.C. Board of Elections during part of Gill\u2019s three terms as an appointee to the board, recounted long nights together in a conference room awaiting election results. They would order some type of chicken, one of Gill\u2019s favorite foods, and invariably joke about who got to eat the last piece. They talked about their kids, how to handle the transition from high school to college, and how to make the District\u2019s elections more fair.\n\nWhen Bennett\u2019s daughter died from bone cancer, he said, Gill made a point to show that he cared.\n\nAt work, Gill\u2019s current and former bosses described him as instrumental in some of their biggest professional achievements.\n\nAt the Housing Policy Council, a trade association where he serves as a senior vice president, the association\u2019s president, Ed DeMarco, described him as smart, witty, and outgoing: \u201cIt is a joy to see an individual that is equally passionate and dedicated to their professional life and to their personal life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring his time as chief of staff to Giancarlo, the former chairman said, Gill was key in facilitating the agency\u2019s first collective bargaining agreement with its union, instituting a new pay and performance system that helped address pay inequality, and was \u201cmaster of relations with Capitol Hill,\u201d where he had worked in the past.\n\n\u201cI truly believe that whatever was accomplished, if anything was accomplished during my term, 95 percent of the credit goes to Mike Gill, who did it quietly without asking for any kudos for himself,\u201d Giancarlo said.\n\nGiancarlo said he and Gill, both fathers of three kids, had become close friends through their trips across the country and the world. He soon learned that Gill spent Sunday mornings at church with his family and Sunday afternoons taking walks with them through wooded paths in Northwest Washington. Sometimes, he made sure to take only one of his kids on the walk if he wanted to dive deeper into their lives.\n\nGiancarlo also described a true partnership between Gill and his wife, Kristina: \u201cThis is a really happy marriage, a real combination of two people that love and respect each other.\u201d\n\nHe said he had never seen Gill prouder than when his wife, after taking some time off to be with their kids, was promoted to partner at her law firm.\n\n\u201cI knew she would do it,\u201d Gill said, according to Giancarlo."}

Paul D. Ryan, the party\u2019s vice-presidential nominee in 2012, kept dividing Americans into \u201cmakers\u201d and \u201ctakers,\u201d the former being productive taxpayers and the latter what Rand, in her didactic novel \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d referred to as the leeches, looters and moochers. A few weeks before the election, the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, was caught on tape writing off the 47 percent of the population who paid no income taxes as people who are \u201cdependent on government\u201d and would never vote for him.\n\nRepublicans have moved on from that mind-set, partly because Romney\u2019s remarks were immediately recognized as an election-defining gaffe and partly because Donald Trump, four years later, accelerated the party\u2019s shift toward a new voting base without college degrees. Ryan repudiated his old rhetoric before becoming House speaker. Romney, now a senator from Utah, has sponsored a proposal for a federal child benefit that includes households with earnings too low to pay income taxes.\n\nBut the party\u2019s old way of thinking hasn\u2019t completely died out. Some Republicans are slipping back into old habits as they oppose a bipartisan tax bill. The new legislation, which passed the House by a wide margin on Wednesday evening but awaits a vote in the Senate, extends some business tax breaks that would otherwise expire and expands the tax credit for children. Inflation has eroded a lot of the credit\u2019s value in recent years. The bill protects it from further erosion during the next two years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bill also makes the credit more generous to parents with low incomes \u2014 and that\u2019s what has caused controversy on the right. Current law gives the credit only to households that report income this year, so as to encourage work. The bill loosens this requirement. If a family\u2019s income drops from one year to the next, for example, the bill would let it use the higher year\u2019s income to qualify for a bigger credit.\n\nFollow this author Ramesh Ponnuru 's opinions Follow\n\nThe net effect of the bill on work is a subject of reasonable debate. The \u201clookback\u201d provision, for one, might cause some households to drop out of the labor force, though they would still be able to draw benefits based on the previous year\u2019s work. On the other hand, it might make some households more eager to earn, because one year\u2019s work would bring them two years of credits.\n\nFor many of the conservative opponents, though, the empirical claims are secondary to a principled argument: They think it\u2019s wrong to provide benefits to households that don\u2019t pay income taxes. That\u2019s \u201cwelfare,\u201d according to the editors of the Wall Street Journal, the Heritage Foundation and former vice president Mike Pence\u2019s new think tank. They mean it to be a fighting word.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn making this argument, these conservatives are going back to 47-percent-ism. But it was always foolish to fixate on who pays income taxes and who doesn\u2019t. Back in 2012, Romney was drawing on a vein of conservative thought that held that people who don\u2019t pay income taxes will become carefree supporters of bigger government. U.S. history doesn\u2019t bear out that worry: The percentage of nonpayers has gone up and down without having any obvious effect on voting behavior. Besides, the income tax isn\u2019t the only tax on labor: For most Americans, payroll taxes are a heavier burden.\n\nSupposedly, payroll taxes finance Social Security and Medicare while income taxes fund most of the rest of the federal government. But that\u2019s an accounting fiction: Income taxes have helped pay for old-age benefits and payroll taxes have helped pay for the military. If FICA comes out of your paycheck, you\u2019re a taxpayer. And if the government takes less out of your paycheck or gives you a bigger refund, you\u2019re getting tax relief.\n\nThen there\u2019s a final fear raised against any expansion of the child credit for households with no income-tax liability: It\u2019s a step toward a universal basic income, which conservatives generally find revolting. It\u2019s welfare for everyone, after all. And there are proponents of UBI who say the child credit is a step toward their goal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that political thinking is confused. The child credit, under this bill, would continue to go only to households with kids where at least one parent has recently been employed. The weak spot of a universal basic income is that it would have the government give money to people who are neither employed nor raising kids. If we had a large child credit linked to work, the case for a UBI for everyone else would rest on its least-sympathetic recipients."}

The posters will be released weekly over the course of this Lenten season leading up to Easter.\n\nSitting next to one of Francis\u2019 closest advisers, Cardinal Michael Czerny, Maupal said he never sought out official recognition from the Vatican but was \u201cproud and honored\u201d to have been asked to depict Francis\u2019 message in art.\n\n\u201cRepresenting Christian values via art has always been one of the greatest goals of painting and sculpture,\u201d Maupal told reporters. \u201cI have tried to synthesize the profound concepts expressed by the Holy Father through pictorial language in a simple, easily readable style.\u201d\n\nIn the first poster released on Thursday, Francis is shown walking through a desert field of upturned nails, hauling a wheel barrel with a heavy sack and the word \u201cFaith\u201d written on the sack. \u201cThrough the desert, God leads us to freedom,\u201d reads the text, taken from the title of the pope\u2019s message.\n\nMaupal gained broad attention a year after Francis was elected in 2013, with the first graffiti art of the pope as a flying, white caped \u201cSuper Pope,\u201d \u2014 a spinoff on Hollywood\u2019s Superman \u2014 clutching his black satchel with the word \u201cValues\u201d on it. The graffiti appeared on buildings of the Borgo Pio neighborhood near the Vatican.\n\nInitially, Rome\u2019s \u201cdecorum\u201d police scrubbed the images away.\n\nBut they continued to appear, each more embracing of Francis\u2019 message than the last.\n\nIn one, Francis is shown on a ladder playing a game of tic tac toe, using peace signs for the zeroes, as a Swiss Guard peers around the corner to keep watch. In another, Francis is shown dangling from a harness like a window-washer, trying to clean the sky of pollution.\n\nOver time, Maupal became somewhat part of the establishment as far as the Vatican was concerned. In 2022, Francis met with him, and that same year Maupal started collaborating with the Vatican newspaper, L\u2019Osservatore Romano. On Thursday, in addition to his place on the podium, the Vatican released a short biographic note about his art and his work in schools and prisons.\n\nAsked about his evolution, Maupal said he never considered himself a \u201crebel artist,\u201d or the type of graffiti artist who remains anonymous because his artwork is, legally speaking, defacing a public space. Each mural is signed \u201cMaupal,\u201d but the artist has never hidden his identity.\n\n\u201cIf I do something on the street, I recognize that it\u2019s an invasion, because the street belongs to everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cSo convinced of this, from my very first work, everyone knew my first name and my last name.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout seeking out officialness, I\u2019ve followed my path, and now I find myself here,\u201d he said."}

Mercedes said Thursday the 39-year-old British driver has activated a release clause in that new deal that will allow him to join Ferrari in 2025.\n\n\u201cI have had an amazing 11 years with this team and I\u2019m so proud of what we have achieved together. Mercedes has been part of my life since I was 13 years old,\u201d Hamilton said in a team statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where I have grown up, so making the decision to leave was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make. But the time is right for me to take this step and I\u2019m excited to be taking on a new challenge.\u201d\n\nHamilton moved from McLaren to Mercedes in 2013 and won six of his seven titles with the Silver Arrows. His 103 race victories are an F1 record, but his last win was in the penultimate race of the 2021 season as Mercedes has struggled to get its new car up to speed against rival Red Bull.\n\nNews first broke early Thursday about Hamilton\u2019s move, but it took the remainder of the day for the teams to address the speculation. Mercedes, with comment from both Hamilton and team principal Toto Wolff, finally said Hamilton was leaving and moments later Ferrari posted a team statement that said simply \u201cScuderia Ferrari is pleased to announce that Lewis Hamilton will be joining the team in 2025, on a multi-year contract.\u201d\n\nNext came a statement from current Ferrari driver Carlos Sainz Jr., who had been in talks on a contract extension but negotiations had seemed to stall near the end of last year.\n\n\u201cFollowing today\u2019s news, Scuderia Ferrari and myself will part ways at the end of 2024,\u201d Sainz wrote. \u201cWe still have a long season ahead of us and, like always, I will give my absolute best for the team and for the Tifosi all around the world. News about my future will be announced in due course.\u201d\n\nHamilton will finish his run at Mercedes alongside current teammate George Russell. He will be teammates at Ferrari with Charles Leclerc, who in December agreed to a long-term extension.\n\nHamilton will be 40 when he moves into a red and black uniform to represent Ferrari. His last championship was in 2020 and he was enroute to a record-breaking eighth title in the 2021 season finale until a controversial finish gave the title to Max Verstappen, who has since gone on to win three consecutive titles as Red Bull has surpassed Mercedes as the top team in F1.\n\nFerrari, meanwhile, has not won a drivers\u2019 title since Kimi Raikkonen in 2007.\n\nThe Hamilton move is fairly stunning, even after prolonged negotiations on the extension he signed last year led to speculation he was considering a move to another team. During one news conference last season, Leclerc was asked about the rumors of a new teammate at Ferrari and turned to Hamilton, laughed, and said \u201cHello, Lewis.\u201d\n\nStill, Hamilton signed the Mercedes extension and insisted he wanted to end his career with his current team because of \u201cunfinished business\u201d and a desire to help Mercedes rebuild its struggling team.\n\nInstead, Wolff said both sides knew their relationship \u201cwould come to a natural end at some point, and that day has now come.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn terms of a team-driver pairing, our relationship with Lewis has become the most successful the sport has seen, and that\u2019s something we can look back on with pride; Lewis will always be an important part of Mercedes motorsport history,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cWe accept Lewis\u2019s decision to seek a fresh challenge, and our opportunities for the future are exciting to contemplate. But for now, we still have one season to go, and we are focused on going racing to deliver a strong 2024.\u201d\n\nHamilton also praised Wolff for his leadership.\n\n\u201cI will be forever grateful for the incredible support of my Mercedes family, especially Toto for his friendship and leadership and I want to finish on a high together,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI am 100% committed to delivering the best performance I can this season and making my last year with the Silver Arrows, one to remember.\u201d\n\nMercedes won only one race in 2022 \u2014 and it was a Russell win \u2014 as the team admittedly badly missed in the design of its new car. Mercedes has spent the past two years trying to improve the car and was winless last season, although Hamilton finished third in the driver standings with six podium finishes.\n\nLeclerc ended last season with three podiums in the last four races as Ferrari began to show signs of being able to contend with Red Bull.\n\nThere had been reports for much of last season that Hamilton was being personally courted by Ferrari chairman John Elkann, but former Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo said Thursday the Hamilton signing was \u201cunexpected.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it can be useful not only for the competitiveness of the team but that it also represents a way to attract attention to the Scuderia, which was needed,\u201d said Montezemolo, who led Ferrari from 1991 to 2014 when the team won six drivers titles and eight constructors championships with Michael Schumacher setting records.\n\n\u201cHamilton is a great champion who will want to end his career by winning the world title. Leclerc is seeking his first title, so it will be fun,\u201d Montezemolo continued. \u201cBut with two No. 1s, it will be even more important to have a winning car \u2014 that will be key, otherwise this choice could end up being a big risk.\u201d\n\nF1\u2019s preseason testing begins in Bahrain on Feb. 21 and the first race is in Bahrain on March 2.\n\n___\n\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing"}

Hardly grateful, the former president regularly tears into Fox for what he sees as disloyalty, even ripping his former White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, now a Fox contributor.\n\nThe discontent illustrates the ongoing importance of Fox News as an agenda-setter that frequently drives, and not simply reflects, Republican politics. No one can get to the top of the GOP\u2019s hill without it.\n\nIt\u2019s also a testament to Fox\u2019s power and influence, said Brian Stelter, media critic and author of two books about Fox News.\n\nIn a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d appearance, Haley suggested her questioners seemed eager to \u201ccoronate\u201d Trump. Shortly before DeSantis ended his own campaign, he said that conservative media outlets like Fox are afraid to challenge the ex-president for fear of losing their audience.\n\nThe past few months were a hard fall for DeSantis, once the beneficiary of so much attention that the Florida governor signed bills for the network\u2019s cameras. He\u2019s made 47 appearances on Fox since last September. Haley had 45 appearances in that time, and Trump six.\n\n\u201cI think they were ready to move on from Trump, but the base of the party was not,\u201d said Erick Erickson, whose conservative talk show airs on 45 stations across the country. \u201cAt the end of the day, these are their viewers and they don\u2019t want to alienate them.\u201d\n\nLONGTIME COMPLAINTS FROM DESANTIS\n\nThe DeSantis campaign was upset about Fox\u2019s town hall with Trump before the Iowa caucuses, when anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum received criticism for treating their subject gently.\n\nTrump had demanded \u2014 and received \u2014 a 9 p.m. Eastern time slot on Fox for a Jan. 10 town hall to blunt the impact of DeSantis and Haley, appearing in their only one-on-one debate the same time on CNN. Fox held separate pre-Iowa town halls for DeSantis and Haley, but at 6 p.m. before prime time.\n\nThe DeSantis team felt Trump received little pushback from Fox when he decided to skip debates. They were angry that surrogates for the former president showed up at post-debate \u201cspin rooms\u201d even with the candidate absent, said a person close to the campaign who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity.\n\nFrustration boiled over when DeSantis\u2019 campaign manager, James Uthmeier, felt that a Fox graphic didn\u2019t show the extent of the candidate\u2019s appearances in Iowa. \u201cFox has turned into full-blown Trump TV,\u201d Uthmeier wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nFox did not make an executive available for an interview for this story. But a representative said that Trump surrogates were on scene post-debate because they had been booked for appearances by other networks. The 6 p.m. town halls weren\u2019t as much a disadvantage as it seemed, since they followed \u201cThe Five,\u201d Fox\u2019s most-watched show.\n\nOn Jan. 16, the day after the Iowa caucus, Fox\u2019s Laura Ingraham urged both DeSantis and Haley to clear the field for Trump.\n\n\u201cIf she drops out today, if she came to terms with the fact that the GOP is a populist party, if she started vigorously campaigning for Trump, she could perhaps rebuild some of the trust that she\u2019s lost with the GOP base,\u201d Ingraham said.\n\nDuring her testy \u201cFox & Friends\u201d appearance on the morning of the New Hampshire primary, Haley rebuffed host Brian Kilmeade when he asked what would constitute a strong showing for her that day. Asked by Ainsley Earhardt if she would withdraw if she lost New Hampshire, Haley said she would not. Kilmeade later repeated the same question.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how much y\u2019all want to coronate Donald Trump,\u201d Haley said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s not what America wants. America wants a choice.\u201d\n\nKilmeade told her, \u201cI really wonder why you think we\u2019re the enemy.\u201d\n\nOne possibility: she had watched Trump give Kilmeade a tour of his plane earlier in New Hampshire. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re in fightin\u2019 shape,\u201d Kilmeade said as he greeted the former president. \u201cHow much weight did you lose?\u201d\n\n\u201cI get their annoyance,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a right to be annoyed by it, (with Fox) essentially pushing them to bow to a reality that they were not prepared to acknowledge.\u201d\n\nA Fox spokeswoman noted that, in response to Kilmeade\u2019s \u201cenemy\u201d comment, Haley said \u201cbecause I\u2019ve looked at the media,\u201d implying a broader criticism. She and DeSantis aren\u2019t staying away, though; both accepted invitations to appear on Fox after making their criticisms.\n\nDuring an interview with New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Haley surrogate, Fox\u2019s Harris Faulkner pushed back when Sununu questioned whether Trump\u2019s age had affected his cognitive abilities \u2014 a frequent Fox topic when President Joe Biden is the subject.\n\n\u201cThe guy is nearly 80 years old,\u201d Sununu said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s 77,\u201d Faulkner replied.\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s nearly 80,\u201d Sununu said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the math later.\u201d\n\nFaulkner admonished Sununu for calling Trump a coward for not debating. \u201cNo name calling,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do name calling.\u201d\n\nNEW ELECTION, SAME FOX MANAGEMENT\n\nThis is the first presidential campaign since the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against the network for spreading lies in its post-2020 election coverage, which Fox settled for $787 million last year. Reams of internal documents released as part of that case showed how Fox executives and personalities greatly feared losing Trump fans in their audience by telling them things they didn\u2019t want to hear.\n\nThe same management is in place now.\n\nLast week, a half hour after a New York jury ordered Trump to pay writer E.

(AP) \u2014 Damian Lillard was greeted with a lengthy standing ovation by an appreciative Portland crowd when he was introduced for Milwaukee\u2019s game against the Trail Blazers on Wednesday night.\n\nLillard, who spent 11 seasons with the Blazers and still has a home in Portland, played his first game in the city since the offseason trade that sent him to the Bucks.\n\nThe sellout crowd at the Moda Center feted Lillard with cheers. He responded with by applauding the fans and held up his hands in a heart shape before his Bucks teammates danced around him.\n\nBut the celebration was muted at the end of the night by the Blazers\u2019 119-116 surprise victory over the Bucks.\n\nIn a news conference before the game, Lillard said his return was surreal.\n\n\u201cEven though I knew I was coming here as a visitor, once I got to my house and took my son to school this morning, it was almost like you forget that this is road game,\u201d he said to more than three dozen reporters.\n\nLillard said he spoke that morning to former teammate CJ McCollum, who played nine seasons with the Blazers before he was traded to New Orleans in 2022.\n\n\u201cHe called me and he was like, \u2018Hey man, embrace it. It\u2019s going to be emotional. We put our time in and we put our work in. We had moments and it was a lot of years of us giving everything we had, and we were appreciated.\u2019 When he came back, he was like, \u2018It was that moment, I felt the appreciation for everything that we put into it,\u2019\u201d Lillard said.\n\nAn eight-time All-Star, Lillard averaged 32.2 points with the Blazers last season. He became just the seventh player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in a game \u2014 that number has since increased to nine \u2014 when he finished with 71 against the Houston Rockets last February. He averaged 25.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 6.7 assists during his time with the Blazers.\n\nBut Portland won only four playoff series in Lillard\u2019s tenure, getting to the Western Conference Finals just once. The team went 33-49 last season, the second consecutive year it finished well outside the playoff picture.\n\nWith Milwaukee, Lillard came in averaging 25.1 points and 6.8 assists. Last week, Milwaukee fired coach Adrian Griffin after only 43 games and hired veteran Doc Rivers to take over with the goal of another NBA title in mind.\n\nLillard said it has been great being part of a team that has \u201ctasted winning and wants to get back to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaying with Giannis (Antetokounmpo) it\u2019s been great. I think playing with another top 75 players, two-time MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, championship Finals MVP, I\u2019m just able to feel what a luxury it is to have a guy as dominant as he is on floor,\u201d Lillard said.\n\nHe would not rule out a possible return to the Blazers someday.\n\nA kid in the stands held a sign directed at Lillard that said: \u201cGo get your ring then come back home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think because of how I feel about Portland, how I feel about the organization here, my time that I spent here, in my mind I\u2019ve always felt that\u2019s how my career would end,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now I\u2019m just in the space of like, this is where I am now. I\u2019m in Milwaukee. I want an opportunity to contend, and our team has an opportunity to contend this years and years to come.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba"}

Planned cuts also have sparked walkouts by employees at other venues, including the New York Daily News and Forbes magazine.\n\nThe Messenger was launched last May and spent heavily \u2014 some would say excessively, given the current media climate \u2014 in hopes of becoming a media heavyweight.\n\nThe company hired experienced journalists from major organizations, including The Associated Press, entered into multimillion-dollar office leases in New York, Washington D.C. and Florida, and ambitiously aimed to draw enough web traffic to reach a monthly audience of 100 million readers.\n\nAt its best, the outlet garnered only a quarter of that figure. It never turned a profit, and it burned through its cash as its ad revenues slumped.\n\nCritics said Finkelstein was relying on an outdated business model that relied on social media distribution and searches to attract eyeballs.\n\nBuzzFeed News, a Pulitzer Prize-winning online news outlet, was a previous victim. CEO Jonah Peretti announced last April that the outlet was shutting down after failing to turn a profit, saying that he\u2019d been slow to accept that \u201cthe big platforms wouldn\u2019t provide the distribution or financial support required to support premium, free journalism purpose-built for social media.\u201d"}

Alana Trissel, 17, said state Rep. Jim Lucas asked the students what brought them to the Capitol and began to defend gun rights.\n\nLucas, a Republican from Seymour, and the group then conversed outside the elevator and one of the students filmed the interaction, as was first reported by the Statehouse File, a student journalism news site at Franklin College in Franklin, Indiana.\n\nIn the video, Lucas told the students that people have to protect themselves and referenced failures of law enforcement to prevent mass casualties during school shootings in Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas,\n\nIn discussing places where firearms are banned, Lucas said people aren\u2019t \u201ctruly free\u201d unless they can defend themselves. A student off camera asked Lucas if he means carrying a firearm. Just over six minutes into the 10-minute video, Lucas said, \u201cI\u2019m carrying right now,\u201d and holds open his suit jacket exposing a holstered handgun. It was not immediately clear what kind of gun Lucas was carrying.\n\n\u201cNothing about someone carrying a gun makes me feel safe,\u201d a student said off camera after Lucas lifted his jacket.\n\nThe Associated Press could not immediately reach Lucas on Wednesday and left messages with his press secretary and at his Facebook page. Phone numbers in public records listed with his name were not connected.\n\nIn public Facebook posts on Tuesday night and on Wednesday, Lucas didn\u2019t describe his actions. He said the conversation \u201cwas respectful, but it was clearly facts, reason and logic vs. plain emotion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fear for, and pity those that are being indoctrinated to fear that which is their best means of self-defense,\u201d he added in a post Wednesday, in which he also linked to news articles about the Parkland and Uvalde killings in the comments section. \u201cPeople are also being indoctrinated to depend on government for their \u2018safety,\u2019 even when shown that government has clearly ruled that government doesn\u2019t have the duty to protect us.\u201d\n\nTrissel said that the conversation took a \u201cturn for the worst\u201d after he showed the weapon. When asked by a student why he feels the need to carry a gun, Lucas said \u201cto be able to defend myself.\u201d\n\nTrissel disputed Lucas\u2019 claim that the group\u2019s argument was based on emotion, and she said she felt talked over.\n\n\u201cSince a state legislator had shown a weapon, I felt all the more powerless,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt scared. I felt alone. I was timid and almost petrified with fear.\u201d\n\nIndiana lawmakers and their staff are allowed to carry handguns in the Capitol and on complex grounds. A bill introduced this year would extend that right to some statewide elected officials and their staff.\n\nThe video shows Lucas telling the students to go to a gun range and learn how to shoot, before Trissel interrupts him and asks if he has lost anyone to gun violence. Lucas said he has defended his family twice with a firearm and did not elaborate.\n\nLucas eventually begins to walk away and asked, \u201cAnybody else have any rational concerns they\u2019d like to address?\u201d When the conversation began again, he walked away.\n\nTrissel said after speaking to Lucas and other state representatives about gun control, she left the Capitol feeling unheard.\n\nLucas was in the news last summer when he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drunken driving charges after police said he crashed his pickup truck through an interstate highway guardrail and drove away. Lucas, who was first elected to the Legislature in 2012, was allowed to keep his position; state law only prohibits those with felony convictions from holding elected office.\n\nLucas is a prominent supporter of loosening gun laws and sponsored a bill last year that established a state-funded handgun training program for teachers.\n\nAccording to a report from The Republic of Columbus, Indiana, Lucas told students at an event in 2020 that gun control laws won\u2019t prevent mass killings at schools and that he was carrying at the moment. He then asked if that scares anyone in the audience, the report says.\n\nHe has faced controversy several times in the past for what critics called racist social media posts."}

YouTube, which is owned by Google, did not attend the hearing despite its status as one of the most popular platforms among teens.\n\nThe disturbing video from Pennsylvania follows other horrific clips that have been broadcast on social media in recent years, including domestic mass shootings livestreamed from Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; and Buffalo, New York \u2014 as well as carnages filmed abroad in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the German city of Halle.\n\nMiddletown Township Police Capt. Pete Feeney said the video in Pennsylvania was posted at about 10 p.m. Tuesday and online for about five hours, a time lag that raises questions about whether social media platforms are delivering on moderation practices that might be needed more than ever amid wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and an extremely contentious presidential election in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another example of the blatant failure of these companies to protect us,\u201d said Alix Fraser, director of the Council for Responsible Social Media at the nonprofit advocacy organization Issue One. \u201cWe can\u2019t trust them to grade their own homework.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for YouTube said the company removed the video, deleted Mohn\u2019s channel and was tracking and removing any re-uploads that might pop up. The video-sharing site says it uses a combination of artificial intelligence and human moderators to monitor its platform, but did not respond to questions about how the video was caught or why it wasn\u2019t done sooner.\n\nMajor social media companies moderate content with the help of powerful automated systems, which can often catch prohibited content before a human can. But that technology can sometimes fall short when a video is violent and graphic in a way that is new or unusual, as it was in this case, said Brian Fishman, co-founder of the trust and safety technology startup Cinder.\n\nThat\u2019s when human moderators are \u201creally, really critical,\u201d he said. \u201cAI is improving, but it\u2019s not there yet.\u201d\n\nRoughly 40 minutes after midnight Eastern time on Wednesday, the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a group set up by tech companies to prevent these types of videos from spreading online, said it alerted its members about the video. GIFCT allows the platform with the original footage to submit a \u201chash\u201d \u2014 a digital fingerprint corresponding to a video \u2014 and notifies nearly two dozen other member companies so they can restrict it from their platforms.\n\nBut by Wednesday morning, the video had already spread to X, where a graphic clip of Mohn holding his father\u2019s head remained on the platform for at least seven hours and received 20,000 views. The company, formerly known as Twitter, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExperts in radicalization say that social media and the internet have lowered the barrier to entry for people to explore extremist groups and ideologies, allowing any person who may be predisposed to violence to find a community that reinforces those ideas.\n\nIn the video posted after the killing, Mohn described his father as a 20-year federal employee, espoused a variety of conspiracy theories and ranted against the government.\n\nMost social platforms have policies to remove violent and extremist content. But they can\u2019t catch everything, and the emergence of many newer, less closely moderated sites has allowed more hateful ideas to fester unchecked, said Michael Jensen, senior researcher at the University of Maryland-based Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, or START.\n\nDespite the obstacles, social media companies need to be more vigilant about regulating violent content, said Jacob Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that social media has become a front line in extremism and terrorism,\u201d Ware said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to require more serious and committed efforts to push back.\u201d\n\nNora Benavidez, senior counsel at the media advocacy group Free Press, said among the tech reforms she would like to see are more transparency about what kinds of employees are being impacted by layoffs, and more investment in trust and safety workers.\n\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, this month laid off hundreds of employees working on its hardware, voice assistance and engineering teams. Last year, the company said it cut 12,000 workers \u201cacross Alphabet, product areas, functions, levels and regions,\u201d without offering additional detail.\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Beatrice Dupuy and Mike Balsamo in New York, and Mike Catalini in Levittown, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

(AP) \u2014 Actor Alec Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to an involuntary manslaughter charge in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer during a rehearsal on a Western movie set in New Mexico.\n\nCourt documents filed Wednesday show Baldwin entered the plea in state district court in Santa Fe, waiving an arraignment that had been scheduled to take place remotely by video conference the next day.\n\nBaldwin, the lead actor and a co-producer on the Western movie \u201cRust,\u201d was pointing a gun at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal outside Santa Fe in October 2021 when the gun went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza.\n\nA grand jury in Santa Fe indicted Baldwin in January after prosecutors received a new analysis of that gun, renewing a charge that prosecutors originally filed and then dismissed in April 2023. Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison if convicted.\n\nBaldwin remains free pending trial under conditions that include not possessing firearms, consuming alcohol or leaving the country. Baldwin can have limited contact with witnesses when it comes to promoting \u201cRust,\u201d which has not been released for public viewing. Baldwin is prohibited from asking members of the \u201cRust\u201d cast or crew to participate in a related documentary film.\n\nBaldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the gun fired.\n\n\u201cHalyna and I had something profound in common, and that is that we both assumed the gun was empty ... other than those dummy rounds,\u201d Baldwin told George Stephanopoulos in an interview broadcast in December 2021 on ABC News.\n\nThe grand jury indictment provides special prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis with two alternative standards for pursuing the felony charge against Baldwin.\n\nOne would be based on the negligent use of a firearm. A second alternative for prosecutors is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Baldwin caused the death of Hutchins without due caution or \u201ccircumspection,\u201d also defined as \u201can act committed with total disregard or indifference for the safety of others.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of the gun conducted by Lucien and Michael Haag of Forensic Science Services in Arizona concluded that \u201cthe trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer of the evidence revolver.\u201d\n\nAn earlier FBI report on the agency\u2019s analysis of the revolver found that, as is common with firearms of that design, it could go off without pulling the trigger if force was applied to an uncocked hammer, such as by dropping the weapon. The gun eventually broke during testing.\n\nMorrissey and Lewis dismissed the earlier charge after they were informed the gun might have been modified before the shooting and malfunctioned.\n\nThe grand jury heard from a \u201cRust\u201d crew member who was a few feet (meters) from the fatal shooting and another who walked off the set before the shooting in protest of working conditions. Weapons forensics expert Michael Haag, a Mississippi-based movie armorer and a detective with the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office also testified.\n\n\u201cRust\u201d weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed also has been charged with involuntary manslaughter, with a jury trial scheduled to start Feb. 22. She has pleaded not guilty to that charge and a second charge of tampering with evidence in Hutchins\u2019 death.\n\nGutierrez-Reed also was charged with carrying a gun into a downtown Santa Fe bar days before she was hired to work as the armorer on \u201cRust.\u201d She has pleaded not guilty to that charge, too.\n\nThe fatal shooting of Hutchins resulted in a series of civil lawsuits, including wrongful death claims filed by members of Hutchins\u2019 family, centered on accusations that Baldwin and producers of \u201cRust\u201d were lax with safety standards. Baldwin and other defendants have disputed those allegations.\n\n\u201cRust\u201d assistant director and safety coordinator David Halls pleaded no contest to unsafe handling of a firearm last March and received a suspended sentence of six months of probation. He agreed to cooperate in the investigation of the fatal shooting."}

Please say a prayer for her.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cLove and Mercy,\u201d the 2014 film about Wilson that drew in part on Melinda Wilson\u2019s memories, she is played by Elizabeth Banks.\n\nMelinda Ledbetter was a Pueblo, Colorado, native who grew up in Whittier, California, and had worked for years as a model before taking a job as a sales representative at a Cadillac dealership in Los Angeles. One day, in the mid-1980s, Brian Wilson turned up, looking to buy a car. As he recalled in his memoir from 2016, \u201cI Am Brian Wilson,\u201d he was immediately attracted to Ledbetter and impressed that she didn\u2019t treat him like a celebrity.\n\n\u201cMelinda looked straight at me when I was introducing myself, stayed calm, didn\u2019t do one thing or the other, and that made me feel normal,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOne of the world\u2019s most revered musicians, Wilson struggled with mental health and substance abuse issues that upended his career in the 1960s and left him dependent on others. At the time he met Ledbetter, Wilson was under the close supervision of psychologist Dr. Eugene Landy, whom Ledbetter and others believed was exploiting and mistreating him. She and Landy feuded for years before Landy was barred in 1992 from any contact with Wilson.\n\nFour years later, she and Wilson married. (Brian Wilson was previously married to Marilyn Rovell, with whom he had daughters Carnie and Wendy, part of the million-selling vocal group Wilson Phillips).\n\nMelinda Wilson was cited by her husband and others for getting him proper medical treatment, and encouraging her husband to complete his intended masterpiece from the \u201860s, \u201cSmile.\u201d In a 2007 interview with The Washington Post, she said she was able to help Wilson because he was ready to help himself.\n\n\u201cI was in the right place at the right time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the concept that you can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t get him to drink.\u201d"}

(AP) \u2014 Travis Kelce is happy to have Taylor Swift on the Kansas City Chiefs bandwagon heading to the Super Bowl.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t evident by their on-field smooch after the AFC title game.\n\nOn the latest episode of their \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast, the Chiefs tight end and his brother, Eagles center Jason Kelce, joked about how the 12-time Grammy winner has come along at just the right time. Swift began dating the younger Kelce after he invited her to a game earlier this season, and she has been a frequent attendee at Chiefs games ever since.\n\n\u201cShout out to the newest member of the Chiefs Kingdom, Swift, who has officially reached the Super Bowl in her rookie year,\u201d Jason Kelce said in the podcast released Wednesday, before Travis added with a laugh: \u201cShout out to Tay. Thanks for joining the team.\u201d\n\nWhether Swift makes it to the Super Bowl against the 49ers on Feb. 11 in Las Vegas remains to be seen.\n\nSwift is scheduled to resume her Eras Tour next week with four shows in Tokyo. The finale is scheduled for Saturday night and should end around 10 p.m. local time, or about 5 a.m. in Las Vegas. If she took a private plane between the two cities, Swift could cover the distance in roughly 12 hours, giving her plenty of time to make it to Allegiant Stadium before kickoff.\n\nSpeaking of flights, American Airlines and United Airlines got on board, so to speak, with the Taylor-and-Travis romance this week. Flight 1989 \u2014 Swift was born that year and it\u2019s the title of her fifth studio album \u2014 will run twice from Kansas City to Las Vegas next week, while Flight 87 \u2014 Kelce\u2019s jersey number \u2014 leaves from Kansas City the day after the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cTo our customers who are huge sports fans, look what you made us do,\u201d American said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nKelce and Swift have tried to keep their relationship out of the spotlight, though it has become increasingly difficult. That\u2019s been especially true during game broadcasts, when networks have received pushback from NFL fans for showing too much of the \u201cShake It Off\u201d singer\u2019s in-suite celebrations, often with Brittany Mahomes, wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nStill, the Swift effect appears to be real when it comes to expanding the NFL audience.\n\nCBS, which aired the Chiefs\u2019 17-10 win over Baltimore on Sunday, shattered the AFC title game record with 55.473 million viewers in the afternoon window; the previous record was 54.85 million for the Jets-Steelers game in the late window in 2011. That represented an uptick of 17% over last year\u2019s early conference championship game between San Francisco and Philadelphia.\n\nIn fact, the Chiefs-Ravens game was the most-watched non-Super Bowl program on CBS since the 1994 Winter Olympics.\n\nThat isn\u2019t all due to Swift, of course. The Chiefs, who are headed to their fourth Super Bowl in five years, are one of the league\u2019s most visible franchises. Mahomes and Kelce have played charity golf matches, the latter has hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and both have become almost ubiquitous in TV ads selling everything from insurance to soup.\n\nChiefs coach Andy Reid said last week that he appreciates the way Kelce has focused on his job amid everything else.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really seen it affect him in any way,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything with his relationship, with his off-the-field stuff, with the commercials, \u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019 all that stuff. He just goes. I think all that plays into what he is. That\u2019s just part of it. He does all that stuff real easy. I don\u2019t think that gets him out of his personality and he has to change at all.\u201d\n\nKelce has certainly been playing his best during the playoffs this season. He had seven catches for 71 yards in a wild-card win over Miami, five catches for 75 yards and two scores in a divisional win in Buffalo, and then he ripped apart the Ravens\u2019 seemingly impregnable defense last weekend with 11 catches on 11 targets for 116 yards and a score.\n\nAlong the way, the four-time All-Pro passed Jerry Rice for the career record for postseason receptions with 156. He matched Rice with his record eighth playoff game of at least 100 yards receiving. And his 21 playoff starts are easily a franchise record.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot for Swift \u2014 and the Chiefs \u2014 to celebrate.\n\n\u201cListen, she\u2019s been great,\u201d Reid said on SiriusXM this week. \u201cI knew her before, from Philadelphia. Her dad played at Delaware and was a big football fan and good guy. So I had met him there, and her. And so that was the last thing Trav wanted to hear, that I knew her before him. She told him, \u2018I know your coach,\u2019 and he went: \u2018Oh, God. Come on!\u2019\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a good girl,\u201d Reid added, \u201cand I\u2019m happy for Trav. And there have been no distractions that way at all. And Trav\u2019s handled it right. She\u2019s handled it right. And we just move forward. So it hasn\u2019t been a problem at all.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"}

Jordan and Ronald Washington, an accused accomplice, have pleaded not guilty to murder.\n\nRincon told jurors in the men\u2019s trial that Jam Master Jay, born Jason Mizell, was in his studio\u2019s lounge area on the evening of Oct. 30, 2002, playing a football video game and talking business with him and another aide, when the door opened. In walked Jordan, the rap star\u2019s godson, Rincon said.\n\n\u201cHe kind of walked directly to Jay and gave \u2014 like, half a handshake, with an arm. And at the same time, that\u2019s when I hear a couple of shots,\u201d Rincon testified. He said he was looking down at his ringing phone as the gunfire erupted, then looked up again.\n\n\u201cAnd then I see Jay just fall,\u201d he said.\n\nThen, Rincon said, he felt pain in his left leg and realized that he\u2019d been shot and that the 37-year-old hip-hop luminary was gravely wounded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to tend to my wound, and at the same time, I\u2019m trying to give Jay attention \u2014 asking him: Is he OK? Can he talk? Whatever \u2014 and he is just not responding,\u201d Rincon testified.\n\nHe said that during the shooting, Washington was at the studio door, telling the other aide to get on the ground and stay there. Both suspects fled down a hallway toward the building\u2019s back door and fire escape, he said.\n\nThe rap star had a gun, which was sitting by his side on a sofa armrest during the 10-to-15-second encounter, Rincon said.\n\nRincon, who goes by Tony, was the first eyewitness to testify in the long-awaited trial over the death of Mizell. The DJ helped rap gain a wider audience through his role in Run-DMC, the 1980s powerhouse group that notched the genre\u2019s first gold and platinum albums and was known for such hits as \u201cIt\u2019s Tricky\u201d and its take on Aerosmith\u2019s \u201cWalk This Way.\u201d\n\nThe trial opened Monday, and on Tuesday, Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall ruled that Jordan\u2019s rap lyrics \u2014 which include first-person accounts of violence and drug dealing \u2014 can\u2019t be used against him at trial, as prosecutors sought.\n\nJordan, known as \u201cLittle D,\u201d and Washington, who\u2019s nicknamed \u201cTinard\u201d and was a childhood friend of Mizell\u2019s, were arrested in 2020. Prosecutors say the two had been planning a cocaine deal with the rap star and killed him because they were about to get cut out.\n\nWashington\u2019s lawyers have said authorities had no clue who killed Mizell and that they brought a case held together only with \u201ctape and glue.\u201d Jordan\u2019s attorneys have said he was at his then-girlfriend\u2019s home at the time of the shooting.\n\nWhile questioning Rincon Wednesday, defense lawyers emphasized that he repeatedly told investigators that he hadn\u2019t quite seen and couldn\u2019t identify the gunman. He maintained the same even while giving the Daily News of New York a 2007 interview.\n\nRincon said he \u201comitted the truth\u201d because he was scared for himself and his mother, particularly after \u2014 according to him \u2014 Jordan approached them at Mizell\u2019s funeral to ask Rincon whether he\u2019d seen the gunman. (He said no.)\n\nRincon said he also struggled to fathom what had happened.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand what I saw,\u201d Rincon said, about how someone he knew \u2014 and who knew Mizell \u2014 could have killed him. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was hard for me to grasp.\u201d\n\nHe finally named Jordan and Washington to authorities around 2017. At the time, he also told investigators that Mizell had uttered \u201cOh\u201d and an expletive as the shots were fired.\n\nWhen asked why he finally did so, Rincon said he thought of Mizell\u2019s surviving family.\n\n\u201cI felt that his wife and his children needed closure, and I felt that they should know what took place,\u201d said Rincon, who gave composed but heavy-hearted testimony, at times speaking softly or taking heavy breaths. Washington, 59, and Jordan, 40, showed no visible emotion as he pointed to them out in court.\n\nRincon had started doing various tasks at Mizell\u2019s studio at 17 and considered him a music-business mentor. A college student in his mid-20s at the time of the shooting, Rincon sought counseling afterward and moved out of state, he said.\n\n\u201cAre you still scared today?\u201d asked Mark DeMarco, a lawyer for Jordan.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Rincon said."}

(AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed Disney\u2019s free speech lawsuit against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, dealing a setback to the company\u2019s hopes of regaining control of the district that governs Walt Disney World after it was taken over by the governor\u2019s appointees.\n\nU.S. District Judge Allen Winsor in Tallahassee said in his decision that Disney lacked standing in its First Amendment lawsuit against the Republican governor and the secretary of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity. The judge also said Disney\u2019s claim against DeSantis\u2019 appointees to the Disney World governing district lacked merit.\n\nDisney said it plans to appeal the federal judge\u2019s decision. A separate lawsuit over who controls the district is still pending in state court in Orlando.\n\nDisney had argued that legislation signed by DeSantis and passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature that transferred control of the Disney World governing district from Disney supporters to DeSantis appointees was in retaliation for the company publicly opposing the state\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law. The 2022 law banned classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades and was championed by DeSantis, who had used Disney as a punching bag in speeches on the campaign trail until he recently suspended his campaign for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\n\nDisney supporters had run the district, which provides municipal services such as firefighting, planning and mosquito control, for more than five decades after the Legislature created it in 1967.\n\nFILE - Republican presidential candidate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a campaign event at Wally\u2019s bar, Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024, in Hampton, N.H. A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed Disney\u2019s First Amendment lawsuit against Gov. Ron DeSantis, leaving the company\u2019s hope of regaining control of a district that governs Walt Disney World in its fight in another state court challenge. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)\n\nWinsor, who was appointed to the bench by President Donald Trump in 2019, said in his decision that Disney didn\u2019t have standing to sue the governor because DeSantis already had picked the appointees to the board of the governing district.\n\n\u201cBecause Disney seeks injunctive relief, it must allege an imminent future injury ... and it has not alleged facts showing that any imminent future appointments will contribute to its harm,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nIn dismissing the claim against the DeSantis appointees to the district\u2019s board, Winsor wrote that when a law on its face is constitutional, plaintiffs can\u2019t make free-speech claims challenging it because they believe lawmakers acted with unconstitutional motives. The law that revamped Disney World\u2019s district didn\u2019t single out Disney by name but rather special districts created before the ratification of the Florida Constitution, a group that included the Disney district and a handful of other districts, he said.\n\n\u201cHere, similarly, no one reading the text of the challenged laws would suppose them directed against Disney,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThe laws do not mention Disney.\u201d\n\nThe DeSantis-appointed chairman of the revamped district, Martin Garcia, called the lawsuit a distraction. He said now that it is behind them, board members can focus on making appropriate changes to the district\u2019s operations \u201cto promote transparency and accountability while bringing more prosperity to more people in Florida.\u201d\n\nDisney said the case was too important for it to end, with serious implications for the rule of law.\n\n\u201cIf left unchallenged, this would set a dangerous precedent and give license to states to weaponize their official powers to punish the expression of political viewpoints they disagree with,\u201d Disney said in a statement.\n\nThe governor\u2019s press secretary, Jeremy Redfern, said the judge\u2019s decision supported DeSantis\u2019 belief that Disney doesn\u2019t have a right to its \u201cown special government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe days of Disney controlling its own government and being placed above the law are long gone,\u201d Redfern said.\n\nBefore control of the district changed hands from Disney allies to DeSantis appointees early last year, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with Disney shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees claimed the \u201celeventh-hour deals\u201d neutered their powers, and the district sued the company in state court in Orlando to have the contracts voided.\n\nDisney has filed counterclaims that include asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable.\n\nSince the takeover of the district by the DeSantis appointees, about 50 of its 370 employees have departed, with many complaining that the district has become politicized and the backgrounds of the five DeSantis appointees have been distracting.\n\nDisney, which employs more than 75,000 workers in central Florida, has said it plans to make $17 billion in investments at Disney World over the next decade that will create an additional 13,000 jobs.\n\nBut Disney CEO Bob Iger last year described the actions taken by DeSantis and the Florida Legislature as \u201canti-business\u201d and \u201canti-Florida.\u201d Last year, Disney scrapped plans to build a new campus in central Florida and relocate 2,000 employees from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development following a year of attacks by DeSantis and Republican lawmakers.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mike Schneider on X: @MikeSchneiderAP."}

That caused sportsbooks to drop the opening number that favored the Niners by 2 or 2 1/2 points to 1 or 1 1/2 points.\n\nFanDuel Sportsbook opened the Niners as 2 1/2-point favorites, and that number was 1 1/2 on Wednesday.\n\nCaesars Sportsbook had San Francisco as a 3-point favorite last week in a hypothetical matchup with the Chiefs. But then Kansas City followed a 27-24 upset victory over Buffalo by shutting down Lamar Jackson as Kelce dominated and Taylor Swift cheered from a stadium suite.\n\nThe 49ers had to rally from 24-7 down at home to beat Detroit 34-31. That was the second week in a row San Francisco had to come back to win after previously defeating Green Bay 24-21.\n\n\u201cSo they haven\u2019t looked good,\u201d said Adam Pullen, Caesars assistant trading director. \u201cJackson had a few errors, but I think the Chiefs had a more impressive win. So I think that led to us opening at 2, opening even lower than what we predicted the week before. The money\u2019s been pretty steady on the Chiefs so far, so we\u2019re at 1 1/2.\u201d\n\nBetMGM public relations manager John Ewing said 71% of the bets and 78% of the money has come on the Chiefs on the betting spread, pushing the number on the 49ers from 2-point favorites to just a point. It was even more pronounced on the money line, with 84% of the bets and 79% of the money going to KC.\n\nSurprised?\n\n\u201cNo, not given the recent play by Kansas City as underdogs here in the last two games in the postseason, winning both of those and looking good doing it,\u201d Ewing said. \u201cSo we are not surprised that they\u2019re getting the action right now.\u201d\n\nPROS STILL CARRY THE DAY\n\nProfessional bettors, otherwise known as sharps, affect betting lines for all sports. The casual gambler? Not so much.\n\nBut the Super Bowl is one event where the casuals make up a much larger share of the money.\n\nIt still doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cPublic money won\u2019t move the line,\u201d Ewing said. \u201cGenerally, the public likes to bet with their heart.\u201d\n\nLAS VEGAS\u2019 SUPER DEBUT\n\nPullen moved to Las Vegas in 1990 shortly after UNLV\u2019s basketball team won the national championship and the city was all about the Rebels.\n\nThe Super Bowl being in Vegas wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar at that time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s come a long way from being just UNLV Runnin\u2019 Rebel basketball and boxing to what it is now hosting every major sporting event,\u201d Pullen said. \u201cSo, yeah, that\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d\n\nGOING BIG\n\nA Michigan bettor put $1 million at Caesars on the 49ers on the money line at minus-120.

The move drew strong criticism from state and national leaders, including Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Florida Gov. and presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, both Republicans.

(AP) \u2014 A grainy sonar image recorded by a private pilot has reinvigorated interest in one of the past century\u2019s most alluring mysteries: What happened to Amelia Earhart when her plane vanished during her flight around the world in 1937?\n\nNumerous expeditions have turned up nothing, only confirming that swaths of ocean floor held no trace of her twin-tailed monoplane. Tony Romeo now believes his new South Carolina-based sea exploration company captured an outline of the iconic American\u2019s Lockheed 10-E Electra.\n\nArchaeologists and explorers are hopeful. But whether the tousled-haired pilot\u2019s plane lies at the roughly 16,000-foot (4,800-meter) depth remains to be seen. And debates abound about the proper handling of whatever object is discovered.\n\nArchivists are hopeful that Romeo\u2019s Deep Sea Vision is close to solving the puzzle \u2014 if for no other reason than to return attention to Earhart\u2019s accomplishments.\n\nAmelia Earhart\u2019s plane is seen at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 16, 2010, after an overhaul of one of the museum\u2019s original galleries, the \u201cPioneers of Flight\u201d exhibit. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nRegardless, the search is on for the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHow did deep sea vision detect the object that could be Earhart\u2019s plane?\n\nRomeo wanted more of an adventure than his commercial real estate career. His father flew for Pan American Airlines, his brother is an Air Force pilot and he has a private pilot\u2019s license himself. Hailing from an \u201caviation family,\u201d he\u2019d long held interest in the Earhart mystery.\n\nRomeo said he sold his real estate interests to fund last year\u2019s search and buy a $9 million underwater drone from a Norwegian company. The state-of-the-art technology is called the Hugin 6000 \u2014 a reference to its ability to break into the deepest layer of the ocean at 6,000 meters (19,700 feet).\n\nA 16-person crew began a roughly 100-day search in September 2023, scanning over 5,200 square miles (13,468 square kilometers) of seafloor. They narrowed their probe to the area around Howland Island, a mid-Pacific atoll between Papua New Guinea and Hawaii.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until the team reviewed sonar data in December that they saw the fuzzy yellow outline of what resembles a plane.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we came out with an image of a target that we believe very strongly is Amelia\u2019s aircraft,\u201d Romeo told The Associated Press.\n\nA model of the Lockheed Model 10 Electra that Amelia Earhart was flying during an attempt to make a flight around the world in 1937 is shown in Atchison, Kan. on Wednesday, March 21, 2012. (Eric Keith/The St. Joseph News-Press via AP)\n\nThe next step is taking a camera underwater to better examine the unidentified object. If the visuals confirm the explorers\u2019 greatest hopes, Romeo said the goal would be to raise the long-lost Electra.\n\nUltimately, Romeo said his team undertook the costly adventure to \u201csolve aviation\u2019s greatest unsolved mystery.\u201d An open hatch could indicate that Earhart and her flight companion escaped after the initial impact, Romeo said, and a cockpit dial could lend insight into what, exactly, went wrong.\n\nFrom alien abduction to Japanese execution, theories abound\n\nEarhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared while flying from New Guinea to Howland Island as part of her attempt to become the first female pilot to circumnavigate the globe. She had radioed that she was running low on fuel.\n\nAn undated file photo shows American aviatrix Amelia Earhart. (AP Photo, File)\n\nThe Navy searched but found no trace. The U.S. government\u2019s official position has been that Earhart and Noonan went down with their plane.\n\nSince then, theories have veered into the absurd, including abduction by aliens, or Earhart living in New Jersey under an alias. Others speculate she and Noonan were executed by the Japanese or died as castaways on an island.\n\n\u201cAmelia is America\u2019s favorite missing person,\u201d Romeo said.\n\nDeep Sea Vision\u2019s is hardly the first foray. David Jourdan said his exploration company Nauticos searched in vain on three separate expeditions between 2002 and 2017, surveying an area of seafloor about the size of Connecticut. Those efforts were preceded by a $1 million hunt in 1999 from Nevada-based Dana Timmer. As recently as 2014, Timmer had not given up and sought to raise nearly $2 million for another go.\n\nBetween 1988 and 2002, the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery made six trips to a different island in the western Pacific Ocean under the impression that Earhart crash-landed on a flat reef 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) south of Hawaii.\n\nHillary Clinton, then the U.S. Secretary of State, encouraged the group in 2012 when it launched a new search for the wreckage fueled by analysis of a 1937 photo believed to show the Lockheed Electra\u2019s landing gear jutting out of the island\u2019s shoreline.\n\n\u2018We need to see more\u2019\n\nA flight suit jacket designed by Amelia Earhart is seen on display at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 16, 2010, after an overhaul of one of the museum\u2019s original galleries, the \u201cPioneers of Flight\u201d. The jacket is from a suit called the \u201cNinety-Nines Flying Suit.\u201d (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nMaritime archaeologist James Delgado said Romeo\u2019s potential find would change the narrative, but \u201cwe need to see more.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s drop some cameras down there and take a look,\u201d said Delgado, senior vice president of the archaeological firm SEARCH Inc.\n\nDelgado said Romeo\u2019s expedition employed world-class, cutting-edge technology that was once classified and is \u201crevolutionizing our understanding of the deep ocean.\u201d\n\nBut he said Romeo\u2019s team must provide \u201ca forensic level of documentation\u201d to prove it\u2019s Earhart\u2019s Lockheed. That could mean the patterns in the fuselage\u2019s aluminum, the configuration of its tail and details from the cockpit.\n\nJourdan, of Nauticos, would have expected to see straight wings and not swept wings, like the new sonar suggests, as well as engines. But that could be explained by damage to the aircraft or reflections distorting the image, he acknowledged.\n\n\u201cIt could be a plane. It certainly looks like a plane. It could be a geological feature that looks like a plane,\u201d he said.\n\nDorothy Cochrane, an aeronautics curator at the National Air and Space Museum, said Romeo\u2019s crew searched in the right place near Howland Island. That\u2019s where Earhart desperately sought a runway when she disappeared on the last leg of her flight.\n\nIf the object really is the historic aircraft, the question for Cochrane will be whether it is safe to raise. How much of the machinery is still intact would be determined in part by how smoothly Earhart landed, she added.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you have to really look at this image and say, \u2018What have we got here?\u2019\u201d said Cochrane.\n\nWhat if Earhart\u2019s Lockheed electra has been found?\n\nIf the fuzzy sonar images turn out to be the plane, international standards for underwater archaeology would strongly suggest the aircraft remain where it is, said Ole Varmer, a retired attorney with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a senior fellow at The Ocean Foundation.\n\nAn original, unpublished personal photo of Amelia Earhart dated 1937, along with goggles she was wearing during her first plane crash are seen Friday, Sept. 9, 2011, at Clars Auction Gallery in Oakland, Calif. (AP Photo/Ben Margot, File)\n\nNonintrusive research can still be conducted to reveal why the plane possibly crashed, Varmer said.\n\n\u201cYou preserve as much of the story as you can,\u201d Varmer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the wreck. It\u2019s where it is and its context on the seabed. That is part of the story as to how and why it got there. When you salvage it, you\u2019re destroying part of the site, which can provide information.\u201d\n\nRaising the plane and placing it in a museum would likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars, Varmer said. And while Romeo could conceivably make a salvage claim in the courts, the plane\u2019s owner has the right to deny it.\n\nEarhart bought the Lockheed with money raised, at least in part, by the Purdue Research Foundation, according to a blog post by Purdue University in Indiana. And she planned to return the aircraft to the school.\n\nRomeo said the team believes the plane belongs in the Smithsonian. Acknowledging the \u201cuncharted territory\u201d of potential legal issues, he said his exploration company will \u201cdeal with those as they come up.\u201d\n\nFinley reported from Norfolk, Virginia.

So, what can viewers expect?\n\nSome new, some old. Executive producers Raj Kapoor, Ben Winston, and Jesse Collins are returning for their fourth year \u2014 evolving the show from their first, which required completely reimagining the Grammys for COVID-19. In 2021, they had the idea to turn musicians into each other\u2019s audiences when there couldn\u2019t be one, a concept that has informed every Grammys since.\n\nFor example: artists sit at tables near the front of the stage to give the sense that the musicians and the audience as \u201cjust having a really lovely evening together,\u201d Winston told The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone away from the big, grandiose, massive theaters with rows and rows and rows of people and actually try to make a really beautiful, bespoke concert every year.\u201d\n\nHe says there will continue to be no close ups of musicians as the winners are read out \u2014 \u201cand then people rewind to see the disappointment in people\u2019s faces,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed that because it becomes a bit too competitive. We\u2019ve really just tried to make it a loving room for the music community.\u201d\n\nSome elements of the stage \u2013 like the gramophone in the middle \u2013 will remain the same. \u201cI really like the ideal of keeping elements of last year, but then changing key parts of it,\u201d he says \u2013 building off of what has succeeded in the past and making appropriate alterations for the new year.\n\nSimilarly, comedian Trevor Noah will host for a fourth time. \u201cThere\u2019s never a hesitation, never a hiccup. There\u2019s never a stumble,\u201d says Recording Academy CEO and President Harvey Mason jr. of their returning host. \u201cHe relates so well to the artists and to the music community in my mind, because he\u2019s a fan and he\u2019s an appreciator and a lover of music.\u201d\n\nBut what\u2019s new in 2024, and what should viewers keep an eye out for? Here are five burning questions \u2014 and answers.\n\nWOMEN RULE MAJOR CATEGORIES. HOW WILL THAT TRANSLATE TO THE GRAMMY STAGE?\n\nWinston says \u201cbest pop solo performance\u201d will likely be the first award of the night \u2014 remarkable because every nominee in the category is a woman.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the same throughout the show, really \u2014 it\u2019s dominated by women,\u201d he says, joking that he brought up doing \u201cladies\u2019 night at the Grammys with only women performers,\u201d which was quickly shot down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about the mix of talent we have, and that\u2019s based on the nomination this year, which skew heavily female,\u201d says Kapoor. \u201cThat is something we\u2019re really celebrating. It\u2019s almost unprecedented.\u201d\n\nMason agrees, crediting the inclusion of so many women to the changing demographics at the Recording Academy.\n\n\u201cWe have so many great women nominees leading some of the general feeling categories, which to is a direct result of a lot of the changes that we\u2019ve been making at the academy,\u201d he says.\n\nLast year, the organization announced over 2,400 diverse music creators joined their voting bloc \u2014 50% are people of color, 46% are under the age of 40, and 37% are women.\n\nWHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM THE PERFORMANCES?\n\nWinston says there will be between \u201c12 to 15 performers \u2014 it depends on if the memoriam counts as one or three.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe likes to put an arc through our show beyond just seeing performances on the stage,\u201d Mason says of Winston. \u201cIt feels like teamwork at all times \u2014 each artist brings their creative ideas; they have a creative director from their team collaborate with a creative director from our team \u2014 so it is this incredible mashup of ideas to produce the final results you see on TV.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S DIFFERENT IN 2024?\n\nWinston says that for some artists, his team has created short films to play before their performances in order to \u201ctell the story of the artist\u2019s year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to put the spotlight on them and the significance of the moment that the audience are about to witness,\u201d he says, to provide helpful context for a general audience.\n\nThere are three new categories at the 2024 Grammy Awards as well, including the first-ever best African music performance award. Burna Boy, who is among the announced performers, is nominated in the category.\n\nKapoor points out, too, that this is the second year in a row that the Grammys are collaborating with a visual artist for its design: this year is Dave McLeod, a digital artist from the fine art world.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE DEAL WITH AI?\n\nLast year, the Recording Academy announced a series of changes to the Grammy Awards to better reflect an evolving music industry. Of those newly instituted guidelines, protocols involving technological advancements in machine learning sparked headlines: \u201cOnly human creators\u201d could win the music industry\u2019s highest honor in a decision aimed at the use of artificial intelligence in popular music.\n\nWhat has been the public reaction \u2013 and how will artists respond? \u201cI haven\u2019t heard much yet \u2013 I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll hear more after the show,\u201d says Mason. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure how we treat AI next year will be different than how we treat it next year. Right now, the way our awards team functions, there wouldn\u2019t be any music that was not eligible in any of the categories \u2014 so voters were able to vote with confidence that the screening has already taken place.\u201d\n\nWHO MIGHT MAKE HISTORY AT THE GRAMMYS?\n\nThat\u2019s impossible to predict, but there are certainly a few contenders: if Taylor Swift takes home album of the year, she\u2019d break the record of the artist with the most wins, ever, with four.\n\nIf Victoria Mon\u00e9t \u2019s \u201cHollywood\u201d wins best traditional R&B performance, her daughter Hazel Mon\u00e9t will become the youngest Grammy winner in history at 2 years old. Karol G could become the first female artist to ever win in the best m\u00fasica urbana album category if she wins for \u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito.\u201d Jack Antonoff could tie Babyface as the producer with the most consecutive wins in the producer of the year, non-classical category with a third win in 2024.\n\nKelly Clarkson could break the record for most best pop vocal album wins if she gets her third trophy for her 2023 album \u201cChemistry.\u201d Kendrick Lamar could extend his record in the best rap performance category if he wins for a seventh time for \u201cThe Hillbillies,\u201d his track with his cousin Baby Keem.\n\nThere are likely many more examples \u2013 we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\n\n___\n\nFor more Grammys coverage, visit https://apnews.com/hub/grammy-awards"}

His 2002 death remains one of rap\u2019s most infamous slayings.\n\nIn her 14-page order, Brooklyn Federal Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall traced the evolution of hip-hop over five decades, referencing tracks from over a dozen artists before ultimately finding the lyrics inadmissible.\n\n\u201cFrom the genre\u2019s nascence as an oral tradition, rap artists have played the part of storytellers, providing a lens into their lives and those in their communities,\u201d Hall wrote.\n\nProsecutors had sought to introduce several lines written by Jordan that described first-person accounts of violence and drug dealing, including: \u201cWe aim for the head, no body shots, and we stick around just to see the body drop.\u201d\n\nThose lyrics didn\u2019t detail the specific crime, Hall wrote, but \u201cmerely contain generic references to violence that can be found in many rap songs.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to similar lines written by rappers Nas, Ice Cube and Vince Staples, along with interviews with artists like Fat Joe and Future who have publicly discussed the distance between their art and real lives.\n\nDiving further into the genre\u2019s past, Hall cited the political activism of artists like A Tribe Called Quest and Queen Latifah, along with the role \u201cgangsta rap\u201d played \u201cas a portal for others to see into America\u2019s urban centers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Court cannot help but note that odious themes \u2013 including racism, misogyny, and homophobia \u2013 can be found in a wide swath of genres other than rap music,\u201d she added in a footnote, even referencing lyrics from the Rolling Stones and Jason Aldean, a controversial county music star.\n\nThe use of rap lyrics in criminal prosecutions has become a contentious subject in several high-profile cases, including the ongoing racketeering trial of Young Thug. In that case the judge allowed the lyrics to be presented at trial \u2014 a decision that defense attorneys say amounts to racist \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d meant to poison a jury already skeptical of rap music.\n\nIn her ruling on Tuesday, Hall wrote that courts should be \u201cwary\u201d about allowing the use of hip-hop lyrics against criminal defendants because \u201cartists should be free to create without fear that their lyrics could be unfairly used against them at a trial.\u201d\n\nShe said there could be specific exceptions in cases where lyrics discuss the precise details of a particular crime.\n\nJordan and an accomplice, Ronald Washington, are accused of confronting Mizell in his recording studio in 2002, then shooting him in the head. The prosecution argues it was an act of revenge for cutting them out of a drug deal.\n\nThe killing had frustrated investigators for decades, but prosecutors said they made key strides in the case over the last five years, conducting new interviews and ballistic tests and getting witnesses to cooperate.\n\nDefense lawyers have claimed the government dragged its feet in indicting Washington and Jordan, making it harder for them to defend themselves.\n\nBoth men have pleaded not guilty, as has a third defendant who was charged this past May and will be tried separately."}

(AP) \u2014 Hal Buell, who led The Associated Press\u2019 photo operations from the darkroom era into the age of digital photography over a four-decade career with the news organization that included 12 Pulitzer Prizes and some of the defining images of the Vietnam War, has died. He was 92.\n\nFILE - Former Associated Press Vice President and Executive News Photo Editor Hal Buell addresses family and friends gathered at the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine for the memorial service for photographer Eddie Adams on Oct. 21, 2004, in New York.

His final two months were spent with her and her husband, and he died in their home with his daughter at his side.\n\n\u201cHe was a great father, friend, mentor, and driver of important transitions in visual media during his long AP career,\u201d Barbara Buell said. \u201cWhen asked by the numerous doctors, PT, and medical personnel he met over the last six months what he had done during his working life, he always said the same thing: \u2018I had the greatest job in the whole world.\u2019\u201d\n\nColleagues described Buell as a visionary who encouraged photographers to try new ways of covering hard news. As the editor in charge of AP\u2019s photo operations from the late 1960s to the 1990s, he supervised a staff that won a dozen Pulitzers on his watch and he worked in 33 countries, with legendary AP photographers including Eddie Adams, Horst Faas and Nick Ut.\n\nFILE - South Vietnamese National Police Chief Brig Gen.

But that was the very thing Buell encouraged.\u201d\n\nBuell made the crucial decision in 1972 to run Ut\u2019s photo of a naked young girl fleeing her burning village after napalm was dropped on it by South Vietnamese Air Force aircraft. The image of Kim Phuc became one of the most haunting images of the Vietnam War and came to define for many all that was misguided about the war.\n\nAfter the image was transmitted from Saigon to AP headquarters in New York, Buell examined it closely and discussed it with other editors for about 10 minutes before deciding to run it.\n\nFILE - In this June 8, 1972, file photo taken by Huynh Cong \u201cNick\u201d Ut, South Vietnamese forces follow behind terrified children, including 9-year-old Kim Phuc, center, as they run down Route 1 near Trang Bang after an aerial napalm attack on suspected Viet Cong hiding places. (AP Photo/Nick Ut, File)\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any objection to the picture because it was not prurient. Yes, nudity but not prurient in any sense of the word,\u201d Buell said in a 2016 interview. \u201cIt was the horror of war. It was innocence caught in the crossfire, and it went right out, and of course it became a lasting icon of that war, of any war, of all wars.\u201d\n\nUt was just 20 when he made the iconic photo that won him the Pulitzer Prize. Without Buell\u2019s support, he said, the photo might never had become a symbol of the war.\n\n\u201cHe thought it was powerful, and he wanted to get it out right away,\u201d Ut said by phone Tuesday.\n\nFILE - Heavily armed African American students leave Straight Hall at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., on April 20, 1969, after barricading themselves in the building led by Ed Whitfield, far right, demanding a degree-granting African American Studies program.

(AP Photo/Sal Veder, File)\n\nOut of the Army two years later, he joined AP\u2019s Chicago bureau as a radio writer, and a year later, in 1957, was promoted to the photo desk in AP\u2019s New York office.\n\nBuell returned to Tokyo at the end of the decade to be supervisory photo editor for Asia and came back to New York in 1963 to be AP\u2019s photo projects editor.

Buell implemented the transition from a chemical darkroom where film was developed to digital transmission and digital news cameras.

Rubenstein, a Baltimore native, would take over as the team\u2019s controlling owner, and he\u2019s assembled an investment team that includes Ares co-founder Michael Arougheti.\n\nThe Angelos family has been in control of the Orioles since 1993, when Peter Angelos purchased the team for $173 million. Angelos\u2019 son John is the team\u2019s current chairman. The team recently reached a deal on a new lease extension at Camden Yards. Maryland officials approved that long-term agreement after months of negotiations.\n\nThe deal extended the lease for 30 years, with an option to end it after 15 if the team does not receive approval from state officials for development plans next to the ballpark.\n\nPrior to forming Carlyle in 1987, Rubenstein practiced law in Washington. From 1977-81, he was a deputy assistant for domestic policy to President Jimmy Carter. After graduating from Duke in 1970, he attended University of Chicago Law School.\n\nThe sale agreement, which requires approval from major league owners, was first reported by Puck.\n\nThe Orioles are coming off a 101-win season and their first AL East title since 2014. With young stars like Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson \u2014 and another top prospect on the way in Jackson Holliday \u2014 the future looks as bright as it has in a while for a team that hasn\u2019t won a World Series since 1983.\n\nOne sore spot with fans is the club\u2019s payroll, which has remained low, and it\u2019s been another quiet offseason for the team so far. If the new ownership group is able to keep Baltimore\u2019s young core together, the Orioles could have a lengthy window of contention.\n\nWhen Peter Angelos first took control of the Orioles, they had recently started playing at Camden Yards, the downtown venue that revolutionized the way baseball parks were built. The Orioles spent aggressively, at least for a little while, and won the division in 1997 with future Hall of Famers Cal Ripken, Roberto Alomar, Mike Mussina and Harold Baines.\n\nAfter that, Baltimore didn\u2019t make the postseason again until 2012, when the Orioles began a renaissance under manager Buck Showalter. They eventually had to rebuild again, losing at least 108 games in 2018, 2019 and 2021 \u2014 a streak interrupted only by the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.\n\nEven as the team posted the best record in the American League last year, there were ominous signs, such as a New York Times piece in which Angelos was quoted as saying: \u201cWhen people talk about giving this player $200 million, that player $150 million, we would be so financially underwater that you\u2019d have to raise the prices massively.\u201d\n\nA sale must be approved in a vote of at least 75% by the 30 major league teams.

Google will find it through a new partnership aimed at saving water in New Mexico", "domain": "apnews.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMITuzgEw4fQo", "text": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 New Mexico is teaming up with Google to hunt for leaky water pipes using satellite imagery as the drought-stricken state prepares for a future in which growing demand puts more pressure on already dwindling drinking water supplies.\n\nState officials made the announcement Tuesday as they rolled out a 50-year plan that includes nearly a dozen action items for tackling a problem faced by many communities in the western U.S., where climate change has resulted in warmer temperatures and widespread drought.\n\nNew Mexico is the first state to partner with Google for such an endeavor, state officials said, noting that the payoff could be significant in terms of curbing losses and saving municipalities and ratepayers money over the long term.\n\nThe water plan notes that some systems in New Mexico are losing anywhere from 40% to 70% of all treated drinking water because of breaks and leaks in old infrastructure.\n\nThe plan calls for using new technology and remote sensing techniques to conduct an inventory of water loss across more than 1,000 public water systems in the state this year. Aside from being able to detect leaks in real time, the information will help to prioritize repair and replacement projects, officials said.\n\nGov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Native American leaders and other experts gathered at the state Capitol to provide an overview of the plan, which has been years in the making. Lujan Grisham, who had campaigned more than four years ago on creating a long-term plan to guide management of the finite resource, warned that New Mexico will likely have 25% less water available in five decades.\n\nLujan Grisham, who is entering her second term, praised residents for existing conservation efforts but said New Mexico has to do better and be more creative about tapping what she called \u201can ocean of brackish water.\u201d That water, she said, can be used for industrial purposes so that businesses can continue to contribute to the state\u2019s economy while limiting impacts on drinking water supplies.\n\nShe pointed to computer chip manufacturer Intel, which for years has been recycling the water it uses at its factory near Albuquerque.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to make that choice between safe drinking water and your business,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe have the chance here to do both and that\u2019s exactly the path we\u2019re on.\u201d\n\nSome environmental groups have raised concerns about Lujan Grisham\u2019s plan to underwrite development of a strategic new source of water by buying treated water that originates from the used, salty byproducts of oil and natural gas drilling. They contend that it will help to encourage more fossil fuel development in what is already the No. 2 producing state in the U.S.\n\nWater from oil and gas drilling can be viable for certain applications, and all industries \u2014 including oil and gas \u2014 have to reduce their overall use and protect current supplies, the governor said Tuesday.\n\nState lawmakers who attended the governor\u2019s news conference vowed that the budget being hashed out during the current legislative session will include more money for water infrastructure projects. One proposal calls for funneling another $100 million to the state water board to disperse for shovel-ready projects.\n\nIn 2018, New Mexico rolled out a water plan that included details about policies at the time, historical legal cases and regional water plans. While it offered an inventory of the state\u2019s needs, critics said it fell short of laying out a concrete path for how to solve New Mexico\u2019s water problems.\n\nAside from addressing antiquated infrastructure, New Mexico\u2019s new plan calls for cleaning up contaminated groundwater, spurring investments in desalination and wastewater treatment, and improving mapping and monitoring of surface and groundwater sources.\n\nRebecca Roose, the governor\u2019s senior infrastructure adviser, described the plan as a set of guideposts that can help the state keep moving forward on water policy and infrastructure investments.\n\n\u201cWe see a path forward around our water conservation, around making sure we have the water availability that we need \u2014 driven by science \u2014 cleaning up and protecting our water and watersheds,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this is going to live and evolve and grow.\u201d"}

Those looking for tea leaves will, however, seize on the exact phrasing of the Fed\u2019s statement that may have offered a slight inkling the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is adjusting its stance.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.\u201d\n\nBefore markets could go off to the races, the Fed also threw a cautionary comment into the statement.\n\n\u201cThe Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range (of its overnight lending rate) until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Best Cartoons on the Economy View All 182 Images\n\nThe move, widely expected, was nonetheless watched closely as the first meeting of 2024 for a sign that the Fed is nearing rate cuts. Most observers believe it will happen in late spring, but there is a small chance of a reduction in rates at the central bank\u2019s next meeting in March. That now seems like wishful thinking.\n\nIndeed, Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to take a March cut completely off the table in his comments at his press conference, saying it was \u201cprobably not the most likely case or the base case.\u201d\n\nPowell said that while inflation has come down in the past six months, with the core rate excluding energy and foods of the metric he most closely watches down to the Fed\u2019s 2% target, he and the other members of its monetary policy committee wants to see a little more confirmation of the trend.\n\nOver 12 months, the core rate has come down to 2.9%, he pointed out, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re wanting to see more data. You\u2019ve had six good months, but what is really going to shake out.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he suggested that if \u201cwe saw an unexpected weakening in the labor market that would certainly weigh on moving sooner.\u201d\n\nMarkets sold off after the announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down a modest 70 points but that drop hastened as Powell spoke, with the average about 200 points lower by 3 p.m.\n\n\u201cI am not surprised the Fed maintained current rates,\u201d said Greg Friedman, principal and CEO of Peachtree Group, a real estate investment firm. \u201cI expect they will be very data-driven on when and if they will cut rates, but if they do, it will be in the latter half of the year.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Fed began raising rates in earnest in 2022 and they are now at the highest level in two decades.\n\nBut recent economic data \u2013 from the fourth quarter report on gross domestic product to last week\u2019s benign reading on inflation \u2013 has supported the narrative of a resilient economy that has overcome the drag of high interest rates and a labor market that remains good but not so strong as to ignite wage inflation.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has been very fortunate that the economy has not only held up, but also been pretty strong, while at the same inflation has gone down,\u201d said Brian Henderson, chief investment officer at BOK Financial. \u201cHowever, they do need to be careful about holding rates up too far, too long.\u201d\n\n\n\nEconomists are predicting a slowdown this year. But that was also the case in 2023, when the majority forecast a recession that never materialized. The American consumer, the bedrock of the economy, has simply continued spending. Although credit card usage and balances have soared, causing some to say consumers are in financial duress, they have also seen their incomes rise and their assets such as homes and stocks go up.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a record level of new credit card authorizations,\u201d said Charlie Wise, senior vice president of research at credit reporting firm TransUnion. But, he adds, \u201cConsumers have more income to pay their debt.\u201d\n\nAverage credit card balances per person hit $6,400 at the end of 2023, Wise said, slightly higher than the peak of $6,300 seen in 2008 when the country was grappling with the Great Recession. But, accounting for inflation, \u201cthe level back then was clearly much higher.\u201d\n\n\n\nThose who have pressed for the Fed to cut early believe the overnight lending rate set by the Fed is too high, given that the most recent three-month reading on inflation favored by Powell is now around 2% \u2013 or the same as the target set by policymakers. Even housing costs, one of the laggards in showing signs of disinflation, are stabilizing or coming down, as in the case of apartment rents."}

Yet the rate of total syphilis cases across U.S. states and the District of Columbia \u2013 including all stages of the infection and congenital syphilis \u2013 rose by 17%, CDC figures show, with the total number of cases increasing 80% compared with 2018.\n\n[ READ: Congenital Syphilis Soars Amid \u2018Missed Opportunities\u2019 ]\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022, the rate of chlamydia cases held largely steady, and the rate of gonorrhea infections fell 9.2%. A drop in total gonorrhea cases was the first in at least a decade, according to a statement from Dr. Laura Bachmann, acting director of the CDC\u2019s Division of STD Prevention. But Bachmann said officials would examine whether it marked \u201ca true decline in infections\u201d or was tied to changes in diagnoses and reporting.\n\nThe continued growth in syphilis cases is of particular concern, especially in light of potential funding cuts that could hamper efforts to curb sexually transmitted diseases: The country\u2019s 207,255 cases marked its highest total since 1950, according to the CDC, while the rate of primary and secondary syphilis cases \u2013 when the disease is particularly contagious \u2013 rose by 9% from 2021 to 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, cases of congenital syphilis \u2013 which occurs when a mother passes a syphilis infection to her baby while pregnant and can result in the infant\u2019s death \u2013 surged by more than 30% year over year to 3,755, and the rate of 102.5 cases per 100,000 live births is the highest reported since 1991. There were 282 stillbirths and infant deaths related to congenital syphilis in 2022, and five states \u2013 Texas, California, Arizona, Florida and Louisiana \u2013 accounted for nearly 60% of congenital syphilis cases that year.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. syphilis epidemic worsened yet another year, and swift action is urgently needed to slow the curve,\u201d Bachmann said.\n\nBy race and ethnicity, CDC data shows the rate of chlamydia infections in 2022 was highest among Black individuals at 1,113.3 cases per 100,000, while Asians had the lowest rate at 100.6 per 100,000. Black individuals also had the highest rate of reported gonorrhea cases in 2022 at 585.9 infections per 100,000 people, while Asians had the lowest rate at 39.8 per 100,000. American Indian and Alaska Native people had the highest rate of primary and secondary syphilis cases in 2022, at 67 per 100,000. The rate of congenital syphilis also was highest in connection with American Indian and Alaska Native mothers in 2022, at 644.7 cases per 100,000 live births.\n\n[ READ: The U.S. Hasn\u2019t Seen Syphilis Cases This High Since 1950 ]\n\nNotably, public health efforts to mitigate sexually transmitted infections were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the CDC urges caution when interpreting trends from that time period, as factors such as \u201cchanges in access to sexual health care, as well as disruptions in public health services\u201d, can impact the number of cases reported. For example, the CDC says reduced screening and a focus on other infections may have impacted how many chlamydia cases were reported.\n\nThese are the states with the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases per 100,000 population in 2022, according to available figures from the CDC and based on cumulative cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis."}

Tales about secret organizations plotting to take over the world, about the good guys working to save it, and about the proof that, if you knew where to look, was hiding in plain sight.\n\nTo Ramona, her boyfriend Don's tales of conspiracy theories sounded like a movie. A lot of it didn\u2019t make much sense, but Ramona would nod along anyway. Don enjoyed telling his stories and showing off what he\u2019d read online. He always knew the answer.\n\nThe pair met while still in high school. They worked at the same fast-food place in Ramona's hometown in western Tennessee. They started dating a few years later. Don was a big guy, good with engines, somebody who could fix anything. Ramona had always wanted to be a teacher and was enrolled at a nearby college. Sometimes she struggled with anxiety, but with Don she felt safe.\n\nThe couple moved in together as COVID-19 swept the globe. To Don, the pandemic and the global response to it were filled with clues pointing to some kind of conspiracy, orchestrated by America's leaders and the media. Maybe the virus was accidentally leaked from a lab; maybe it was a bioweapon. Don also suspected the lockdowns had a nefarious purpose, and he believed the vaccines were unsafe, perhaps designed to kill.\n\nDon\u2019s wild stories had seemed innocent and even silly before, but in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic they suddenly seemed plausible. At a scary time, when questions about the virus outnumbered answers, the conspiracy theories filled in some of the blanks.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\n\u201cI have a lot of fear about what I can\u2019t control,\u201d Ramona, now 23, said of her vulnerable mindset as COVID-19 spread. Ramona agreed to tell her story to The Associated Press after she detailed her experiences on a forum for recovering conspiracy theorists. The AP is not fully identifying Ramona or her ex-boyfriend to protect her privacy and safety. \u201cThe stuff he was telling me, it made me feel like at least we understood. He had an explanation for what was going on. I didn\u2019t realize what I was getting into.\u201d\n\nThis alternate reality nourished by these conspiracy theories would transform Ramona\u2019s life, sending her down a dark path of paranoia and loneliness that upended her life and spun her dreams of the future into turmoil. Convinced that a \u201cNew World Order\u201d was already underway, she fell into a trap that has ensnared millions of Americans and even, at times, hijacked the nation's politics.\n\nIsolated from friends and family, distrustful of the explanations offered by officials and the media, Ramona and Don began to prepare. The military might try to put Americans like them in concentration camps run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. They had to be ready to flee.\n\nThe couple began stockpiling food and supplies. Don started a \u201cgo-bag\u201d containing survival gear. He used their modest savings to buy a rifle, a handgun and ammunition.\n\nOne cold day in January 2021, Don read about a power outage in Vatican City on one of his conspiracy theory websites. The couple discussed what it might mean: Perhaps the Pope had been secretly arrested for his role in the conspiracy to control the world. Or maybe the bad guys had knocked out the power so they could smuggle child sex victims in or out of the Vatican.\n\nEither way, the outage meant something big was happening. There are no coincidences. Just clues to be deciphered.\n\nA few hours later, Ramona was in the bedroom when the lights in their Tennessee home flickered and then went out. Don started yelling. Ramona says he sounded almost exhilarated.\n\n\u201cHe comes running into the bedroom,\u201d Ramona recalled. \u201cHe says, 'Honey, we gotta go. This is it!\u2019\u201d\n\nThey loaded their guns and the dog into the car and drove into the darkness.\n\nDOWN THE RABBIT HOLE\n\nThe AP spoke with more than a dozen people whose lives were disrupted by conspiracy theories \u2014 either because they believed them or because a close loved one did.\n\nMany spoke of the social isolation that comes from spending more and more time on conspiracy theory websites and message boards.\n\nThey talked about money lost to investment scams or products that claimed to reverse aging or cure COVID-19. They talked about a mounting sense of paranoia and distrust as they began to lose faith in their community and their fellow Americans.\n\nFormer believers said conspiracy theories offered them meaning when they felt empty, even if those promises proved to be hollow themselves.\n\n\u201cI was suicidal before I got into conspiracy theories,\u201d said Antonio Perez, 45, a Hawaii man who became obsessed with Sept. 11 conspiracy theories and QAnon until he decided they were interfering with his life two years ago. Back then, when he first found other online conspiracy theorists, he was ecstatic. \u201cIt\u2019s like: My God, I\u2019ve finally found my people!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I got a sense of self-importance\u201d from conspiracy theories, Perez said. He believed that he alone \u201cwas figuring everything out. It all ties into wanting to be a hero.\u201d\n\nBelief in conspiracy theories is a common, and usually harmless, part of people's instinctive need to identify threats and explain the unknown. They can be an entertaining diversion for many, though for some, obsessive interest in these claims can lead to social isolation, paranoia and distrust.\n\nSuch beliefs also create their own community.\n\nWebsites, streaming podcasts, online forums and Facebook groups have created virtual refuges for conspiracy theorists. They are places to speculate and swap information without worrying about the mockery of outsiders, virtual clubs where, for a few hours at least, the unseen forces behind the headlines can be seen and understood.\n\nSimilar online communities have sprouted for the family members and loved ones left behind when someone is consumed by conspiracy theories such as QAnon.\n\nOn forums on Reddit and other sites, they mourn lost relationships and bemoan the fantasy worlds that consumed their loved ones.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve really been missing my mom lately,\u201d reads a post from a woman whose mother fell into QAnon. Another post mourns a relationship with a brother, lost to the conspiracy theory: \u201cI miss his goofy laugh most of all.\u201d\n\nPeople choose what to believe. They build a worldview day by day, using it to understand the past and present and to make decisions for the future. But if people pick the wrong stories, they risk lying to themselves, and to each other.\n\n\u201cWe are the stories we tell ourselves,\u201d said John Llewellyn, a professor at Wake Forest University who studies conspiracy theories and why people believe what they believe. \u201cWe\u2019ve landed on the moon, and now we\u2019ve got artificial intelligence \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 but no matter how advanced we get, we still have to deal with the human brain.\u201d\n\nBut the stories people tell themselves aren\u2019t always the same as the truth, and the difference, as Ramona found, can be the difference between freedom and a prison.\n\nRAMONA\u2019S STORY\n\nWhen Ramona was a little girl, her father worked as an auctioneer. One day he brought home an antique school desk that didn\u2019t sell.\n\nWhen Ramona\u2019s friends came over, they played school, with Ramona always taking the role of teacher. When she was alone, she would line up her stuffed animals and \u201cteach them whatever I had learned at school that day,\u201d she recalls. She didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but she was hooked.\n\nRamona was studying for her education degree and living in the dorms when the pandemic hit. Don was working at the local auto plant. When Ramona's classes went online, he urged her to drop out. He was making good money, enough for Ramona to quit her job and leave college. Ramona didn\u2019t want to give up on her education, so as a compromise she transferred to a smaller, local college to be closer to Don during the pandemic. Soon, she had moved in with him.\n\nAlone and isolated because of lockdowns, Ramona read and talked more and more about conspiracy theories. Though Ramona and her boyfriend didn't use the word themselves, their views were consistent with QAnon, the sprawling conspiracy theory that claims Donald Trump is fighting a secret, satanic cult of world leaders and celebrities intent on world domination. The QAnon thinking goes that this group, known as the \u201cCabal,\u201d not only controls world events but also traffics children for sexual exploitation, and consumes human blood in order to extend their lives.\n\nInitially inspired by an anonymous online poster who claimed, without evidence, to have insider government information, QAnon has become a nexus for several related conspiracy theories relating to COVID-19, Trump and U.S. elections.\n\nAs the pandemic wore on, Ramona's anxiety increased. She worried about her future, about her aging father and what a bout of COVID-19 would do to his bad lungs.\n\nShe had had many friends in college, but because of the lockdowns and her relationship with Don, she spoke to them less and less. Don went to work every day, leaving Ramona with little companionship. \"He\u2019d be at work for eight to nine hours a day. I\u2019d have nothing to do,\u201d she said, but dig deeper and deeper down into the bizarre and frightening stories she found online.\n\nThe conspiracy theories didn\u2019t do much to help Ramona\u2019s anxiety, but they did offer answers. They provided an outlet for her fears and gave her the idea that if she just did enough research, perhaps she could have power over them. She joined Facebook groups dedicated to QAnon. She started visiting online chat rooms and forums dedicated to conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cThe world is scary enough without conspiracy theories,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you believe them, at least they can give you answers. If you\u2019re scared of the unknown,\u201d conspiracy theories offer \u201can answer, no matter how farfetched it is.\u201d\n\nTRAINING FOR ARMAGEDDON\n\nRamona and Don spent much of the pandemic preparing for a grim future. QAnon lore prophesied that the forces of good, led by Trump, would triumph over the forces of evil in a final battle known as the \u201cStorm.\u201d Ahead of the Storm, QAnon believers say, all power will be cut, perhaps worldwide, as well as most means of communication.\n\nQAnon adherents call this time the \u201c10 Days of Darkness.\u201d\n\nThe couple began practicing for their escape with drills designed to test their readiness. When Don gave the word, they would scramble to get dressed and load their essentials into the car. Often the training exercises were prompted by something Don had read online.\n\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019d just be laying there on the couch and he\u2019d say, \u2018I think we need to get the stuff ready,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cUsually he\u2019d have been scrolling on his phone before and he\u2019d seen something that would make the lightbulb go off.\u201d\n\nOn the night the power went off, Ramona helped load the dog, the go-bag and the guns into the car. They planned to head to Ramona's parents' house, but when they got to the main road, they saw blue lights flashing up ahead. Two police cruisers were parked along the shoulder.\n\nDon eased the car close and put it in park. He told the others that he wanted to ask the police what was going on.\n\n\u201cStay inside,\u201d he told Ramona. \u201cDon\u2019t get out of the car. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\nHe walked to the squad car. A policeman rolled down his window. There was a quick exchange before Don turned around and walked back to the couple's car, his face set in a grim expression that to Ramona could have been anger, could have been fear.\n\nDon said the officers told him a semitruck had hit a transformer. Power was out for a good chunk of town.\n\n\u201cDoes this mean we should go home?\u201d Ramona asked.\n\nNo, Don said. He didn\u2019t believe the officers\u2019 explanation. With the outage in Vatican City, it was too much of a coincidence.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what they\u2019re telling us,\u201d Don told Ramona and his brother. \u201cThat\u2019s just what they want us to believe.\u201d\n\nThey drove on and as they rounded a bend, they saw the neon glow of a strip mall up ahead. Cars were lined up at a fast-food drive-thru. People were picking up a late dinner, while she and Don were driving off to confront the end of the world.\n\nDon turned the car around and headed home.\n\nThe next day, he dismissed the incident as just another drill and said he hadn't actually been frightened.\n\nRamona had a harder time moving on from the episode. Her mind went over Don\u2019s explanations. Why would the police lie about a power outage? What would an outage in rural Tennessee have to do with Vatican City?\n\n\u201cI started to think: Maybe this is all a hoax,\u201d she said. But when she confessed these creeping doubts to Don, he shook his head. Stay strong, he said. \u201cKeep the faith,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cThe storm is coming.\u201d\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed, Don came up with new drills. He would wake Ramona in the middle of the night and tell her they had to pack the car and leave immediately, only to tell her it had all been a test. He\u2019d hide in closets and jump out when Ramona walked by. If she cried out in surprise, he\u2019d get angry and tell her she had to harden herself if she was to survive the end times.\n\nThe drills just made her more anxious, more easily startled. To this day she hates practical jokes and sometimes worries that someone is hiding behind a door to surprise her.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do when the military comes to put you in a FEMA camp?\u201d he asked her after one of his drills made her break down in tears.\n\nESCAPE\n\nAt first, conspiracy theories helped Ramona make sense of the world. But now her anxiety was increasing. The constant drills, the steady stream of content about child sex trafficking and satanic sacrifices were too much.\n\nWatching funny videos on TikTok had been one of Ramona\u2019s favorite ways to relax. That diversion no longer worked. Seeing people laugh or goof off just made her sad. \u201cI\u2019d just think: Does this person know what\u2019s coming?\u201d\n\nSometimes Ramona couldn\u2019t catch her breath. She worried about the future. She didn't sleep well.\n\n\u201cFor hours at night, I\u2019d just be scrolling and searching and reading. The more I read, the more anxious I got,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also began to think more and more about how none of the predictions and prophecies laid out in QAnon lore had come true. Trump wasn\u2019t reelected in a landslide in 2020. Vaccinated people weren\u2019t turning into zombies. There had been no public executions of \u201cCabal\u201d members on the National Mall in Washington. The 10 days of darkness did not arrive. The storm hadn't come.\n\nAbout this time, one of Ramona\u2019s friends told her she would be taking a break from social media \u2014 a \u201ccleanse,\u201d she called it \u2014 to see if it helped her mental health. Ramona was curious. On some level, she knew her social media habits were connected to her anxiety. On a whim, she decided to join her friend. She now believes some part of her brain saw it as a way out.\n\n\u201cDoomscrolling is how I used to cope with it,\u201d she said, referring to her anxiety.\n\nThe \u201ccleanse\u201d stretched from days into weeks, and Ramona felt her mind unclench. She felt more present. Her thoughts less troubled, her mind wandered. She looked up old friends and thought more hopefully about the future.\n\nBut habits are hard to break. After weeks of ignoring her feed, Ramona logged back on to Facebook. She missed the sense of community she had found in QAnon forums \u2014 the people, not the beliefs \u2014 and wanted to reconnect.\n\n\u201cThere was nowhere to go. It was just gone,\u201d she said. \u201cAt that point, I think I\u2019d decided that I didn\u2019t need it anymore.\u201d\n\nDon wasn't happy when Ramona told him she was done with conspiracy theories. He also wasn't pleased when she mentioned that she wanted to go back to school and finish her degree.\n\nOne day the arguments turned violent, Ramona said. Don had always made Ramona feel safe and protected, but after he hit her, she knew that would never be true.\n\nIt was the final clue she needed.\n\n\u201cI started to realize I had to get out,\" she says.\n\nShe moved out and stayed on friends' couches for a while and then a few months later reenrolled in college. She reconnected with friends and made some new ones, too. She started hanging out with an old high school friend. They started dating after a few months. They got married in 2022.\n\nRamona last spoke to Don about two years ago. She had just gotten vaccinated against COVID-19. When she told him, she could hear him crying softly over the phone.\n\n\u201cHe told me: \u2018Well, you\u2019re going to die within a year,\u2019\u201d Ramona recalls.\n\nThat year passed, and then another. Ramona graduated and got a job teaching fifth grade. Her days and thoughts are filled with students and lesson plans, instead of late-night drills and go-bags, and storms that never came."}

While Tornetta held just nine Tesla shares, the deal had also been criticized by major pension fund California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (CalSTRS) and proxy advisory firms, who viewed the deal as too large.\n\nMusk's 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1% of Tesla's equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of escalating operational and financial goals. Tornetta argued that shareholders were not told how easily the goals would be achieved when they voted on the package.\n\nTesla achieved the financial goals, helping make Musk one of the world's wealthiest people.\n\nTornetta claimed the pay was not necessary to incentivize Musk to achieve success for Tesla, as Musk already owned around 22% of the automaker's stock.\n\nWHAT WAS MUSK'S DEFENSE?\n\nTesla's board argued in court filings that the pay package was needed to align Musk's incentives with shareholders and to keep him focused on the company as it ramped up production of the Model 3. It argued that Musk did not receive any compensation other than the stock options and that if Tesla had not achieved the targets in the pay package, Musk would not have received any money.\n\nShareholders were told that the goals tied to Musk's pay were \"challenging\" yet \"attainable.\"\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nMusk is likely to appeal, experts said. Before that can happen, the judge will have to finalize the ruling and decide on compensation for the lawyers who represented Tornetta on a contingency basis.\n\nEven without the pay package, Musk benefited from his 22% ownership share of Tesla's stock at the time the package was adopted in 2018. Since then, Tesla's stock has risen about 10-fold, raising the value of his stake by more than $100 billion.\n\nCAN TESLA PAY MUSK RETROACTIVELY?\n\nMusk said in January that discussions on a new pay package with the board were on holding pending the outcome of the case over the 2018 package.\n\nThe plaintiff's legal team has said in court documents that the board could adopt a new plan to pay Musk for his work for the last five years, saying that this plan would have to be reasonable.\n\nExperts said any such payment would likely pale in comparison with the stock grant and could lead to more legal headaches.\n\nJesse Fried, an executive pay expert and professor at Harvard Law School, said that while Delaware courts sometimes allow boards to make modest \"gift\" payments to executives for past performance, shareholders could easily sue over such a payment to Musk, claiming it was a waste of corporate resources.\n\n\"Musk has already generated value for the shareholders. If they were to write a check to him now for $10 billion for past performance, what exactly do the shareholders get from that?\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York and Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"}

December\u2019s gain was revised down to 158,000 from 164,000 originally.\n\n\u201cProgress on inflation has brightened the economic picture despite a slowdown in hiring and pay,\u201d said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. \u201cWages adjusted for inflation have improved over the past six months, and the economy looks like it's headed toward a soft landing in the U.S. and globally.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Best Cartoons on the Economy View All 182 Images\n\nDespite the lower-than-expected number, hiring held up across companies of all sizes and industry sectors, with the notable exception of the information industry, where 9,000 jobs were lost.\n\nThe ADP report comes two days ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s monthly jobs report for January, with consensus estimates for about a 180,000 gain in payrolls after December\u2019s better-than-expected 216,000 increase. But seasonal variations and adjustments that happen every January could affect the projections.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the government said that the number of job openings edged up slightly at year\u2019s end, to 9 million from 8.9 million a month earlier.\n\n\u201cThe January jobs report will likely show that the labor market started the year on a solid note,\u201d said Lydia Boussour, EY senior economist. \u201cWe expect nonfarm payrolls to increase 275,000 \u2013 above consensus expectations for a 185,000 gain \u2013 with a 230,000 increase in private sector employment and a 45,000 gain in public sector employment. Large seasonal shifts in employment and the annual benchmark revisions will inject some noise into the January data.\u201d\n\n\n\nA strong number and a moderation in wage growth would leave the Federal Reserve on hold, as most economists predict, when they issue their statement later Wednesday on interest rate policy. Observers will be parsing the words of Chairman Jerome Powell when he holds his post-meeting press conference.\n\n\u201cThe ideal result is that the labor market cools, and wage gains slow without massive layoffs, keeping money in people\u2019s pockets, supporting consumer demand, and capping consumer credit delinquencies,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers. \u201cBut the second consecutive month of increasing job openings supports wage increases, thereby boosting labor costs and working against the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target, likely tilting Powell\u2019s talking points toward hawkish,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nThe strong job market and U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter led the International Monetary Fund to boost its projections of global economic growth this year. The IMF said Tuesday that it now sees global growth of 3.1% this year \u2013 an increase from 2.9% from its last projection in October \u2013 and 3.2% in 2025."}

Monthly e-cigarette sales in the country increased from 15.5 million units in 2020 to 22.7 million in 2022, according to a recent study cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and they are the most common tobacco product used by young people.\n\nWhile proponents contend e-cigarettes can help users of traditional, more harmful cigarettes kick the habit, critics say the packaging of such devices \u2013 along with fruit and candy flavors they\u2019re often offered in \u2013 target children, who can become addicted to nicotine and put themselves at risk of inhaling other harmful materials by using the devices.\n\n\n\nCDC researchers last year published a study showing an estimated 7.7% of middle and high school students, or about 2 million in total, were current e-cigarette users in 2023. More than 60% of youth e-cigarette users used disposable vapes, with popular brands including Elf Bar and Esco Bar. In the U.K., where officials also hope to stop refillable vapes from being sold in child-friendly flavors and packaging, 9% of 11- to 15-year-olds reportedly use vapes.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration regulates e-cigarettes in the U.S., authorizing products on a case-by-case basis that involves an assessment of the risk they\u2019ll be used by young people. So far, the FDA has approved only 23 e-cigarette products and devices, effectively rendering unauthorized products often found on store shelves illegal and manufacturers and retailers subject to enforcement. Yet that enforcement has proved challenging: Citing data from analytics firm Circana, The Associated Press reported late last year that more than 11,500 unique vaping products were being sold in U.S. stores, up from 9,000 products in June.\n\n\n\nGlobally, as many as 121 countries or territories regulate electronic nicotine delivery systems, based on a 2023 World Health Organization report. That includes 33 countries that have moved to ban their sale, and 87 that have implemented regulations such as age restrictions on sales, bans on advertising and prohibiting vaping in public indoor areas.\n\n\n\nCountries That Have Banned the Sale of Vapes/Electronic Cigarettes:\n\n\n\nArgentina\n\nBrazil\n\nBrunei Darussalam\n\nCabo Verde\n\nCambodia\n\nNorth Korea\n\nEthiopia\n\nGambia\n\nIndia\n\nIran\n\nIraq\n\nJordan\n\nLaos\n\nMalaysia\n\nMauritius\n\nMexico*\n\nNicaragua\n\nNorway\n\nOman\n\nPanama\n\nQatar\n\nSingapore\n\nSri Lanka\n\nSuriname\n\nSyria\n\nThailand\n\nTimor-Leste\n\nTurkey\n\nTurkmenistan\n\nUganda\n\nUruguay\n\nVanuatu\n\nVenezuela\n\n(*Mexico's ban reportedly was deemed unconstitutional but appears to remain broadly in place.)"}

But a side gig can also be a gateway to a new full-time income stream.\n\nRead on to learn about three people who turned their side gigs into full-time, six-figure businesses.\n\n\n\n1. Derek Jacobson: Search Engine Optimization Consultant\n\nDerek Jacobson is an SEO consultant based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. After college, he began working as an SEO specialist (as a full-time employee) before deciding to venture into freelancing.\n\n\"I started freelancing in 2014 initially to increase my income with the goal of eventually doing it full-time,\" Jacobson says. \"I was already doing SEO for my full-time job so I figured I could do freelancing on the side. I created an Upwork profile and began sending out two to five job proposals per day.\"\n\nIt took Jacobson a few months to land his first client but once he did, it got easier. \"Having quality referrals and testimonials goes a long way toward building trust with prospective clients,\" Jacobson says.\n\nAfter about a year of moonlighting as a freelancer, Jacobson had doubled his hourly rate and was no longer sending out proposals. He would instead receive five to 10 interview requests per week from Upwork.\n\n\n\nJonathan Conklin Photography\n\nAt that point, he left his full-time job and took on a 30-hour-per-week contract position that allowed him more time to freelance.\n\n\"This was a necessary step to build up enough side income to cover my monthly expenses,\" Jacobson says. And it worked. By the end of his second year freelancing, he had earned six figures.\n\n\"It took me two full years to hit six figures after starting my side gig. I left my previous job once I was able to replace 75% of my income. I also made sure to have two additional clients lined up for when I left my contract job,\" he says.\n\nIn 2016, Jacobson founded Emerald Consulting. Over the last seven years, he's worked with world-renowned brands like Christian Dior, 3M and Adobe and become a top-rated service provider on Upwork, where he charges $150 per hour.\n\nFor anyone who wants to build a six-figure income from the ground up, Jacobson says, \"My advice is to figure out what you do better than anyone else and create a side gig around that. Figure out where your ideal customers or clients are and do everything you can to land that first gig.\"\n\n2. Anna Burgess Yang: Content Marketer and Journalist\n\nB.Hines Photography\n\nAnna Burgess Yang, a full-time freelance content marketer and journalist based out of Chicago, was an executive at a financial technology company for 15 years.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, however, she realized she wanted to do something completely different. She ended up leaving her executive role and entering the world of content marketing.\n\n\"I'd never heard of content marketing, but ran across a job posting from a marketing agency looking for blog writers. The pay was terrible, but I was permitted to republish the work in my own portfolio,\" Burgess Yang says.\n\nAfter a few months, she had a solid portfolio and was able to land a full-time job at a content marketing agency. But leaving an executive role and \"starting over\" resulted in a huge drop in her salary, so she continued freelancing on the side to supplement her income.\n\n\"My first clients were via industry connections. I took on a role as a freelance journalist at a banking publication with a monthly column and editorial assignments,\" Burgess Yang says. \"Additionally, when I announced my departure from my fintech job on LinkedIn, another industry connection reached out and asked if I would write for his company's blog.\"\n\nWith a new full-time job and two steady freelance clients, Burgess Yang wasn't seeking more work but was maintaining a steady presence on LinkedIn. In September 2021, a LinkedIn post she published about The Great Resignation went viral. That resulted in her getting two new freelance clients and got her thinking about freelancing full time.\n\n\"I began to feel the itch to strike out on my own, though I wasn't really sure what that would look like or when I would make that happen,\" Burgess Yang says.\n\nShortly after, in October 2022, she lost her agency job.\n\n\n\n\"Instead of looking for another full-time role, I decided to make the leap. I'd been thinking about it for months but kept telling myself the time wasn't right. Suddenly, I had the opportunity to really give it a go, so I took the chance on myself,\" Burgess Yang says.\n\nThat leap of faith paid off. In her first year of freelancing full time, she earned $115,000.\n\n\"Networking was everything for me. When I announced on LinkedIn that I was going to start freelancing full time and was taking on clients, people immediately reached out to me. This was the result of years of networking and building relationships,\" Burgess Yang says.\n\n3. Melissa Ripp: Marketing and PR Consultant\n\nMiriam Bulcher Photography\n\nMelissa Ripp from Door County, Wisconsin, started her marketing company, Peapod, back in 2007.\n\n\"It was a way to supplement my income while I was working at a very low-paying (but fulfilling) nonprofit organization as their marketing director,\" Ripp says. She also wanted to make sure that marketing services were available to anyone who needed them in her underserved local area.\n\nIn 2010, Ripp and her now-husband moved to Chicago where she found herself in a scarce job market. She ended up getting a waitressing job and freelancing while looking for a full-time job.\n\n\"That was the first time I really saw that with my three freelance clients, I was actually making just as much as I had in my nonprofit leadership role. That was an incredibly energizing realization, but it was also very scary,\" she says.\n\nShe ended up getting another full-time job shortly after, as she wasn't quite ready to take the leap, but continued to run Peapod as a side gig.\n\nBy the end of 2017, Ripp decided she was ready.\n\n\"I spent the next four months getting my ducks in a row \u2013 formally applying for an LLC, getting a business checking account and looking for in-house contract roles that I could apply for while I was building up my business,\" she says.\n\nShe ended up finding a six-month, 35-hour-per-week contract role that began in May 2018. Her previous corporate leadership role consistently required 50- to 60-hour weeks, so this gave her the free time she needed to make Peapod a full-time endeavor.\n\nTo get the ball rolling, Ripp leaned heavily into her network.\n\n\"I reached out to everyone I could in my network,\" she says. \"I must have sent a hundred personalized emails, but they worked. Within my first month of full-time business ownership, I landed three new clients.\"\n\nBy November 2018, Melissa was freelancing full time. And Peapod had its first six-figure year in 2020.\n\nIf you want to build a six-figure income but aren't sure where to start, Ripp recommends asking yourself questions like:\n\nWhat kind of work lights you up?\n\nWhat kind of clients do you love working with \u2013 not just because they're in a particular industry, but because of the way you feel when you're working with them?\n\nWhat tasks do you find yourself procrastinating on?"}

Bush.\n\nBenitez also criticized California's handling of the more than 1 million annual ammunition background checks, calling the 11% rejection rate \"too high.\"\n\nCalifornia appealed the decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and Benitez rejected its request for a stay that would allow background checks during that process.\n\n\"These laws were put in place as a safeguard and a way of protecting the people of California--and they work,\" state Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat. \"Background checks save lives.\"\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, renewed his criticism of Benitez for having issued multiple decisions favoring firearms owners, including a Sept. 2023 ruling that voided California's ban on high-capacity gun magazines.\n\n\"Like clockwork, Judge Benitez has yet again put his personal politics and fealty for the gun lobby over the Constitution and common sense,\" Newsom said. \"California will fight this extremist, illogical, and incoherent ruling as we defend our life-saving measures that are proven to keep our communities safe.\"\n\nPlaintiffs in the case included Kim Rhode, who has won three Olympic gold medals in shooting events, and the California Rifle & Pistol Association.\n\nChuck Michel, the group's president and general counsel, called the decision a \"big win,\" saying California had \"blocked many eligible people from getting the ammunition they need, which is the true political intent behind most of these laws.\"\n\nNO HISTORICAL ANALOGUES\n\nCalifornia voters had in 2016 approved a ballot measure requiring gun owners to undergo initial background checks to buy ammunition, and pay $50 for a four-year ammunition permit.\n\nLegislators amended the measure to require background checks for each ammunition purchase, starting in 2019.\n\nIn his Jan. 30 decision, Benitez rejected California's reliance on dozens of laws dating back to 1789 as \"historical analogues\" for ammunition checks, including restrictions on ammunition possession by enslaved people, Indians and others.\n\nThe judge said it made little sense to argue that \"these repugnant historical examples of prejudice and bigotry\" against people who were not afforded constitutional rights justified similar restrictions now against people who enjoy those rights.\n\nFederal courts have issued divergent Second Amendment rulings since a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that expanded the right of people to arm themselves in public.\n\nThe court said judges shouldn't use the normal way of assessing a law's constitutionality when assessing firearms restrictions, and should instead see if they were \"consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.\"\n\nBenitez stopped short of endorsing the four-year ammunition permit, but said it would be \"a more reasonable constitutional approach than the current scheme.\"\n\nThe judge had also blocked the background checks requirement in April 2020. A federal appeals court asked him to revisit that ruling in light of the 2022 Supreme Court decision.\n\nShira Feldman, director of constitutional litigation at the gun control advocacy group Brady, called Benitez's decision \"an attack on the concept of life-saving background check systems.\"\n\nThe case is Rhode et al v Bonta, U.S. District Court, Southern District of California, No. 18-00802.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler, Bill Berkrot and David Gregorio)"}

Here are five specific issues he identified to Congress:\n\nChinese Hackers Preparing to \u2018Wreak Havoc\u2019\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s hackers are positioning on American infrastructure in preparation to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities, if or when China decides the time has come to strike,\u201d Wray said.\n\n\n\nThe Week in Cartoons Jan. 29 - Feb. 2 View All 16 Images\n\nHe added in his dramatic statement that China isn\u2019t just focused on political and military targets.\n\n\u201cWe can see from where they position themselves across civilian infrastructure that low blows aren't just a possibility in the event of conflict \u2013 low blows against civilians are part of China's plan.\u201d\n\nTikTok and the Chinese Government\n\nWray during the hearing was asked to describe the risks of the Chinese-owned social media site TikTok.\n\n\u201cThe most important starting point is the role of the Chinese government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe app's parent company is effectively beholden to the Chinese government and that is what, in turn, creates a series of national security concerns in the PRC government's ability to leverage that access or that authority.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe specifically cited data collection on millions of users that could be used for \u201call sorts of intelligence operations or influence operations.\u201d\n\nTikTok\u2019s algorithm makes it particularly able to be used for influence operations to sow divisiveness and discord, according to Wray.\n\n\u201cThat's something that we wouldn't readily detect, which makes it even more of a pernicious threat,\u201d he said.\n\nElection Interference\n\nWhile Wray said that Americans could be confident in the U.S. election system, he did pinpoint elections as an increasing target for enemies.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmericans can be confident in our election system and our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am also mindful of the fact that our adversaries are getting more and more sophisticated, and that there are more and more foreign adversaries who want to get in on this game.\u201d\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Disinformation\n\n\u201cObviously, AI will enhance some of the same information warfare that we've seen from our foreign adversaries for quite some time,\u201d Wray said.\n\nCyberattacks and disinformation warfare can work in tandem, Wray warned. He cited efforts from Iran in the 2020 presidential election, where two Iranian nationals were involved in a cyber-enabled campaign to intimidate and influence American voters.\n\nHe also noted that AI can enhance foreign adversaries abilities to collect personal data and feed it into disinformation and influence operations.\n\nHeightened Terrorist Risk\n\n\u201cWe are, since Oct. 7, in a heightened threat environment from various forms of terrorist risk,\u201d Wray warned, alluding to Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel last year.\n\n\n\nHe said that the biggest risk doesn\u2019t actually stem from an attack from groups in the Middle East but rather an individual here in the U.S. who could be motivated by the events taking place."}

But regulating those AI-generated images may pose more challenges than many realize, as only 10 states have directly outlawed some form of the practice amid the rapid growth of artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nThe pornographic and digitally altered images of the superstar singer-songwriter and musician spread last week on social media websites such as X, formerly Twitter. The images were deepfakes, a relatively new term for a seemingly realistic but manipulated video or photo produced by a form of AI. The technology first appeared in late 2017, and subsequent code-sharing has made it more widely available for use, according to the nonprofit Organization for Social Media Safety.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem is that the technology has become less expensive, more accessible and the products of the technology more believable, while the laws and the protections have not evolved as quickly,\u201d says Judith Germano, an adjunct professor and distinguished fellow at NYU School of Law. \u201cSo we need laws, standards, guardrails and political and public discourse that addresses this very serious problem, which has existed for years and seems to become more prevalent as a form of sexual exploitation, abuse, manipulation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is currently no federal law against disseminating such content. However, some legal professionals believe \u201csuch illicit practices may not require new legislation, as they already fall under a patchwork of existing privacy, defamation or intellectual property laws,\u201d according to an article by Law.com.\n\nBut the proliferation of such deepfakes is getting the attention of government officials \u2013 both nationally and at the state level. On Oct. 30, 2023, President Joe Biden issued an executive order directing \u201cthe establishment of new standards for AI safety and security\u201d while also ordering the Office of Management and Budget to \u201cconsider the risks of deepfake image-based sexual abuse of adults and children\u201d in its upcoming AI procurement guidelines.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, at least the 10 states below now have legislation that specifically targets those who create and share explicit deepfake content, as reported by USA Today. Many laws were passed in the last year or so, and outline penalties ranging from fines to possible jail time for offenders.\n\n\n\nThe attempts to combat deepfake practices are not perfect. Germano says some of the state laws require an \u201cillicit motive,\u201d which she notes could put a high burden on the victim to prove their case. States also need to discern, she says, whether their existing laws related to subjects such as privacy, harassment and defamation are enough, or \u201cshould be better defined or expanded.\u201d Most states, for example, have specific laws against revenge porn, a form of cyber sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s a combination of the need for states to have better expertise in how to properly define deepfakes and what appropriate remedies are, so that they are developing laws that are broad enough to address the serious harms, but not stifling other less nefarious uses of the technology,\u201d Germano says.\n\n\n\nDespite the challenges that lawmakers and regulators face, she notes how important it is that the harmful practice is getting more notice."}

I made a promise to give him $20 million more, that will be to the super PAC,\" the Nevada-based owner of Budget Suites of America said in an interview.\n\nThe commitments, which have not been previously reported, show some big money is coalescing around Trump, the runaway frontrunner to clinch the Republican presidential nomination to face Democrat Joe Biden in the November general election.\n\nBigelow's donations also highlight the unusual role some political donors are playing as Trump faces four pending criminal cases this year.\n\nThose cases include two over his efforts to reverse his 2020 presidential election loss, one over his handling of classified documents upon leaving office and another over his hush money payments to a porn star.\n\nBigelow, who also founded Bigelow Aerospace and funds investigations into extraterrestrial life, said he felt Trump was being unfairly targeted in the criminal cases and that his sympathy towards the former president had motivated the donation.\n\n\"I was just sympathetic. They didn't solicit anything from me,\" Bigelow said. The $20 million would be spread out but \"starts right away,\" he added.\n\nThe Justice Department says it acts without political bias.\n\nAll of Trump's Republican rivals, bar former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, have dropped out of the race, and Trump is all but assured of clinching the nomination.\n\nTrump and his team have been seeking to peel wealthy benefactors away from Haley, making calls trying to convince donors to switch sides. Trump has gone so far as to warn the donors they would be banished from his orbit if they made further donations.\n\nBigelow initially backed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for the Republican nomination, but dropped him in part over his strict anti-abortion policies.\n\nBILLS AND FINES\n\nFor all of Trump's political success, however, his legal costs are rapidly mounting.\n\nTrump was hit last week with an $83 million verdict in a defamation case brought by writer E. Jean Carroll, and a judge is set to rule any day now on the New York Attorney General\u2019s request for $370 million in penalties for his misrepresentations to banks about his net worth.\n\nThe New York Times reported earlier on Tuesday that pro-Trump groups spent some $50 million on legal bills and \"investigation-related\" expenses in 2023. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm that figure.\n\nBigelow said he could not remember the exact name of the entity to which he sent the $1 million, but Trump's Save America PAC has been an important vehicle for paying his legal fees. When asked whether he was considering donating more to help pay Trump's legal fees, Bigelow declined to comment.\n\nBigelow said he had dinner with Trump on Monday night at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.\n\n\"It was supposed to be one hour. It was over two hours. And we still ran out of time,\" Bigelow said, declining to provide details of their conversation.\n\nBigelow said he was concerned about turmoil in the Middle East and felt confident in Trump's capacity to navigate crises given his 2017-2021 term in the White House.\n\n(Reporting by Alexandra Ulmer; Additional reporting by Jack Queen; Editing by Ross Colvin and Stephen Coates)"}

However, our membership has steadfastly supported the prohibition on impermissible recruiting contacts, booster involvement in recruiting prospects and the use of NIL offers as recruiting inducements.\u201d\n\nThe latest legal attack on the NCAA came a day after the University of Tennessee's chancellor ripped the association for investigating the school for potential recruiting violations related to NIL deals struck between athletes and a booster-funded and run organization that provides Volunteers athletes a chance to cash in on their fame.\n\nThe NCAA already is facing a lawsuit by a group of state attorneys general challenging the association's transfer rules, plus it is the defendant in antitrust suits targeting employment status for athletes and billions in television revenue that schools and conferences make off big-time college sports.\n\nNCAA President Charlie Baker and college sports leaders have been pleading for federal lawmakers to regulate NIL compensation and provide an antitrust exemption that would allow the association to govern without constantly being dragged into the court.\n\nEarlier this month, the NCAA approved a set of NIL regulations aimed at creating transparency in the market for athletes and protecting them from potential bad actors.\n\nMeanwhile, Baker also is pushing for rule changes that would allow schools to bring NIL activities in-house and even allow some schools to directly pay their athletes through trust funds.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was revealed the NCAA was investigating Tennessee and The Vol Club, an NIL collective run by Spyre Sports Group. Tennessee's recruitment of five-star quarterback Nico Iamaleava from California and his NIL contract with Spyre is among the deals receiving scrutiny from the NCAA.\n\nTennessee Chancellor Donde Plowman wrote a scathing letter to Baker shortly after school officials met with NCAA representatives to discuss the allegations earlier this week. She said leaders of collegiate sports owe it to students and their families to act in their best interest with clear rules \u2014 and the NCAA is nowhere close to providing that.\n\n\u201cInstead, 2 1/2 years of vague and contradictory NCAA memos, emails and \u2018guidance\u2019 about name, image and likeness (NIL) has created extraordinary chaos that student-athletes and institutions are struggling to navigate,\u201d Plowman wrote in the letter released Tuesday. \u201cIn short, the NCAA is failing.\u201d\n\nThe university's president and athletic director and the governor of Tennessee had her back Wednesday morning.\n\nAthletic director Danny White shared the state attorney general\u2019s post of the lawsuit on social media within 20 minutes, writing that he appreciated Skrmetti standing up for the rights of athletes.\n\n\u201cAt Tennessee, we are always going to work to support our student-athletes\u2019 rights and give them all the tools needed to succeed on and off the field,\u201d White tweeted. \u201cThis is what strong leadership looks like!\u201d\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee also applauded the University of Tennessee for being \u201cnothing but forthcoming with the NCAA.\"\n\n\u201cAnd I thank Chancellor Donde Plowman for taking a stand on behalf of all universities and student athletes,\u201d Lee said in a statement.\n\nPlowman was cheered by Tennessee fans during a pregame ceremony Tuesday night before the fifth-ranked Volunteers lost in men\u2019s basketball to South Carolina.\n\nFacing pressure from numerous states legislatures, the NCAA lifted its ban on athletes profiting from their names, images and likenesses in 2021 but did so with no detailed rules and regulations.\n\nThe association still had in place an interim NIL policy that fell back on previous broad rules against recruiting inducements, pay-for-play and boosters being involved in recruiting of athletes. The NCAA issued several clarifications of the policy and guidance to members over the next 18 months, including identifying third-party entities promoting a school\u2019s athletic department as boosters.\n\nThe lawsuit suggests that even those rules break antitrust laws.\n\n\u201cThe NCAA\u2019s NIL-recruiting ban violates federal antitrust law, thwarts the free market, and unfairly limits student-athletes,\u201d Miyares, the Virginia AG, wrote on social media. \u201cWe\u2019re taking them to court.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll"}

(AP) \u2014 A man accused of beheading his father in suburban Philadelphia posted a gruesome video on social media that shows him holding up the severed head and railing against the government, authorities said Wednesday.\n\nJustin Mohn, 32, who is charged with first-degree murder and abusing a corpse, was armed and had jumped a fence at a National Guard facility about 100 miles (160 kilometers) away when he was arrested late Tuesday, hours after the killing, a Guard spokeswoman said.\n\nThe father, identified as Michael F. Mohn, was found decapitated in the bathroom of the home in Levittown where his son also lived.\n\nThe YouTube video, more than 14 minutes long, showed Justin Mohn picking up the head and identifying his father by name. Police said it appeared he was reading from a script as he encouraged violence against government officials and called his father a traitor to his country.\n\nMichael Mohn was a federal employee, an engineer with the geoenvironmental section of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened to learn of the tragic death of our teammate Michael Mohn. ... Our thoughts and prayers are with the Mohn family and we are focused on supporting our grieving employees at this time,\u201d the district said in a statement. It referred any further questions to law enforcement.\n\nPolice said Michael Mohn\u2019s wife, Denice Mohn, arrived home and found the body about 7 p.m. Tuesday. Officers found the body, a machete and bloody rubber gloves, according to a police affidavit. Denice Mohn told police her husband\u2019s white Toyota Corolla and her son were missing.\n\nIn a statement, YouTube said the video, which was uploaded and not livestreamed, was removed for violating its graphic violence policy and Justin Mohn\u2019s channel was shut down. Police said the video was online for about five hours.\n\nMohn, who also was arrested on a weapons possession charge, was arraigned Wednesday and held without bail with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 8. Police and prosecutors were expected to release additional details at a news conference Friday.\n\nAn attorney for Mohn wasn\u2019t listed in court records, and a message seeking comment on his behalf was left at a phone listing for him. The district court office said it had no record of a lawyer representing him.\n\nMohn embraced violent anti-government rhetoric in writings he published online going back several years. In August 2020, Mohn published an online \u201cpamphlet\u201d in which he tried to make the case that people born in or after 1991 \u2014 his birth year \u2014 should carry out what he termed a \u201cbloody revolution.\u201d He also complained at length about a lawsuit that he lost and encouraged assassinations of family members and public officials.\n\nIn the video posted after the killing, he described his father as a 20-year federal employee. He also espoused a variety of conspiracy theories and rants about the Biden administration, immigration and the border, fiscal policy, urban crime and the war in Ukraine.\n\nMohn drove his father\u2019s car to Fort Indiantown Gap, where he was taken into custody, Capt. Pete Feeney of the Middletown Township Police Department said. Officials at the facility were told late Tuesday that Mohn\u2019s cellphone had pinged nearby, according to Angela Watson, communications director for the Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.\n\nHe was walking and had a gun when he was caught, Watson said. She said he has never been a member of the Pennsylvania National Guard.\n\nThe house where Michael Mohn's body was found is in a suburban development of single-family homes. No one answered the door there Wednesday.\n\nNeighbors out walking dogs described Justin Mohn as a regular walker in the development, someone they recognized for his odd behavior.\n\nBart DeHaven said he called police a handful of times since the summer after Justin Mohn sat on a raised manhole cover in a park directly across the street from his home and stared at his house.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just sad,\u201d DeHaven said Wednesday morning. \u201cHe should have got some kind of help.\u201d\n\nCarrie McCarthy said she saw him walking frequently and sitting in the wooded area in the neighborhood. She said someone sent her the YouTube video, which left her stunned.\n\n\u201cI screamed. I totally screamed,\u201d she said. \u201cI opened the video and I was like, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s the guy I see every day, and I knew something was unhinged with him.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile living in Colorado in 2017, Mohn allegedly harassed employees at the Colorado Springs credit union where he once worked, threatening to sue the business for $10 million unless it agreed to a $2 million settlement. He also allegedly threatened to publish false statements about them or come to the credit union and make false statements to provoke police to attack the employees and then film it.\n\nThree employees sought protection orders against Mohn but dropped the case under a settlement in which he promised not to contact them and they paid him $10,000. As part of the case, the workers had submitted the lines from a song or poem written by Mohn that they felt was threatening, entitled \u201cMen Don\u2019t Get No Warning Shot.\u201d\n\nIn one email submitted as evidence, Mohn accused his co-workers of tampering with evidence in a disciplinary matter against him in 2016 and said the state\u2019s civil rights division was investigating.\n\nA man who lived in apartments with Mohn about a decade ago in Colorado Springs recalled hearing Mohn talk at length about conspiracy theories. Davis Rebhan said he left the living situation shortly after Mohn became volatile one night and damaged the walls and other objects.\n\nMohn\u2019s only visitor during the year they lived together was his father, who visited for a weekend, Rebhan said.\n\n\u201cI got nothing from that visit that would have made me ever think this would happen,\u201d Rebhan said. \u201cThere was nothing that would lead me to believe that Justin didn\u2019t care about his dad. And it was really clear that his dad cared about him because it was clear he had these issues and his dad still came across the country to stay with him.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Mohn sued Progressive Insurance, alleging he was discriminated against and later fired from a job at an agency in Colorado Springs because he was a man who was intelligent, overqualified and overeducated. A federal judge said Mohn provided no evidence to indicate he was discriminated against because he was a man \u2014 in the length of his training or in being denied promotions to jobs. Progressive said it fired him because he kicked open a door. An appeals court upheld the finding that Mohn did not suffer employment discrimination.\n\nMohn worked for Progressive from October 2016 until August 2017 and sued the company after his employment ended, spokesperson Jeff Sibel said via email. He did not offer any further comment.\n\n___\n\nAP reporters Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania, Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia, Amy Beth Hanson in Helena, Montana, Colleen Slevin in Denver and Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg contributed.\n\n___\n\nThis story has corrected the name of the victim's wife to Denice Mohn, not Denise Mohn."}

Instead, there are other concrete steps investors can undertake to positively influence investment outcomes with certainty.\n\nThese include keeping fees low, maintaining minimal turnover and ensuring your holdings are well diversified. Each of these factors plays a crucial role in the overall performance of your investments.\n\n\n\nLow fees reduce the amount of your returns that are eaten up by costs, leaving more of your money to grow over time. Minimal turnover, or less frequent trading within the fund, leads to lower transaction costs and potential tax-efficiency. A well-diversified portfolio reduces risk by spreading investments across various assets, sectors or geographies.\n\nVanguard, as one of the nation's largest asset managers, excels in each of these areas. With a robust lineup of 267 mutual funds, Vanguard has established itself as a leader in providing investment options that are both accessible and effective for beginners.\n\nThe firm's unique structure as a shareholder-owned company allows it to focus on continually cutting fees, further benefiting its investors.\n\n\"Beginner investors should consider Vanguard funds for their low costs, diversification across asset classes and regions, simplicity, and robust investor education resources,\" says Sean August, CEO of The August Wealth Management Group. \"In addition, Vanguard's reputable status and client-owned mutual structure helps instill trust and prioritizes investor interests.\"\n\nHere are seven of the best Vanguard funds for beginner investors:\n\nFund Expense ratio Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (ticker: VFIAX) 0.04% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTSAX) 0.04% Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTIAX) 0.11% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (VBTLX) 0.05% Vanguard Target Retirement 2070 Fund (VSVNX) 0.08% Vanguard Balanced Index Fund Admiral Shares (VBIAX) 0.07% Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund (VDIGX) 0.3%\n\nVanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX)\n\nAugust recommends that beginner investors undertake a two-step process when selecting funds for their portfolio. \"Firstly, assessing the fund's investment objective is crucial to ensure alignment with personal investment goals, whether it involves growth, income or a combination of both,\" August says. \"Next, evaluate the fund's risk profile to match it with your risk tolerance, and compare expense ratios.\"\n\nFor younger investors looking for long-term growth and willing to take higher risk, a 100%-domestic-equity fund like VFIAX could be a viable core holding. This mutual fund tracks the S&P 500 index for a low 0.04% expense ratio and has returned 12% annualized over the trailing 10 years. It requires a $3,000 minimum investment, but it can be accessed in ETF form for around $451 per share.\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTSAX)\n\n\"We believe investors can benefit from the diversification of a market-weighted portfolio that provides exposure to the broader market,\" says Sophoan Prak, a certified financial planner at Vanguard. \"For example, investors who buy VTSAX obtain broad exposure to large-, mid- and small-cap U.S. companies, providing a good representation of the broader domestic market.\"\n\nThe CRSP U.S. Total Market Index tracked by VTSAX is meant to serve as an all-encompassing barometer of the investable U.S. market. It includes the stocks found in the S&P 500, but also thousands of other mid- and small-cap stocks excluded by the index. Historically, VTSAX has returned similar to VFIAX, with an 11.4% 10-year annualized return. The fund also charges a 0.04% expense ratio.\n\nVanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTIAX)\n\n\"For even broader diversification, investors can benefit from including international stocks to their portfolio mix,\" Prak says. \"Vanguard's research supports having approximately a 40% exposure to international stocks in order to create a portfolio that is less volatile over the long term.\" For broad exposure to the international market, investors can buy VTIAX.\n\nThe FTSE Global All Cap ex U.S. Index tracked by VTIAX currently spans over 8,300 stocks from both developed and emerging markets. The former includes countries like Japan, the U.K., Canada, France, Switzerland and Germany, whereas the latter encompasses countries like China, India, Mexico and Brazil. VTIAX charges a 0.11% expense ratio and requires a $3,000 minimum investment.\n\nVanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (VBTLX)\n\n\"Your investment goals, time horizon and risk tolerance should be the driver for your portfolio's overall stock and bond asset mix,\" Prak says. \"If you're closer to retirement, consider adding some bonds to the asset mix to reduce the volatility of the portfolio.\" Historically, high-quality bonds have helped investors reduce volatility and drawdowns during recessions and times of market crisis.\n\nFor affordable bond exposure, Vanguard offers VBTLX, which tracks the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index. This mutual fund is meant to provide broad exposure to over 10,000 U.S. government Treasurys, mortgage-backed securities and investment-grade corporate bonds of various maturities. Currently, it pays a 4.3% 30-day SEC yield and charges a 0.05% expense ratio.\n\n\n\nVanguard Target Retirement 2070 Fund (VSVNX)\n\n\"Mutual funds offer a great way to gain broad exposure to a basket of securities,\" Prak says. \"The average person may not have the time or expertise to analyze and build a portfolio of individual stocks and bonds to reap the diversification benefits mutual funds can provide.\" For even greater simplicity, beginner investors can stay totally hands-off by buying a Vanguard target-date fund like VSVNX.\n\nCurrently, this fund allocates around 90% to U.S. and international stocks, and 10% to U.S. and international bonds. However, as the years go by, VSVNX will gradually adjust its allocation to become more conservative. This entails reducing stocks and increasing bonds. Thus, as investors age and their risk tolerance and time horizon change, VSVNX will adapt accordingly. The fund charges 0.08%.\n\nVanguard Balanced Index Fund Admiral Shares (VBIAX)\n\nAs its name suggests, this fund takes a more balanced approach, employing a strategy of 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds for a 0.07% expense ratio.\n\nThe stock side of VBIAX tracks the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index used by VTSAX, whereas the bond side tracks the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index used by VBTLX. This balance has historically helped VBIAX achieve a 10-year annualized return of 7.7% while minimizing volatility and drawdowns, compared to a 100%-equity fund. This fund also has a $3,000 minimum investment requirement.\n\nVanguard Dividend Growth Fund (VDIGX)\n\n\"Less experienced investors may benefit from focusing on well-diversified funds with an emphasis on higher-quality securities,\" says David James, managing director at Coastal Bridge Advisors. \"Inevitably, the markets will correct at some point and that is likely to touch any newbie's nerves, but knowing that you own high-quality securities can help them get through a tough period of time.\" For a focus on quality, consider VDIGX."}

So, the U.S. military is taking a hard look at its own military readiness and trying to play catch-up in a critical area: its logistics network.\n\nThe equipment from Talisman Sabre included roughly 330 vehicles and trailers and 130 containers in warehouses in Bandiana, in southeastern Australia, the Army says.\n\nThe amount of equipment, which the United States military has not previously acknowledged, is enough to supply about three logistics companies, with as many as 500 or more soldiers, focused on ensuring supplies reach warfighters.\n\nIt's the kind of materiel that's needed for a future drill, a natural disaster, or in a war.\n\n\"We're looking to do this more and more,\" Army General Charles Flynn, the top Army commander in the Pacific, told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\"There's a number of other countries in the region where we already have agreements to do that,\" he added, without naming specific countries.\n\nReuters interviews with more than two dozen current and former U.S. officials found that American military logistics in the Pacific is one of the greatest U.S. vulnerabilities in any potential conflict over Taiwan.\n\nU.S. war games have concluded that China would likely try to bomb jet fuel supplies or refueling ships, crippling U.S. air and sea power without having to battle heavily armed fighter jets or sink America's fleet of surface warships, according to current and former officials and experts.\n\nIn response, the United States is trying to spread its military logistics hubs across the region - including warehouses in Australia, officials told Reuters.\n\nAsked about Reuters' conclusions, the Pentagon said that the Department of Defense is working with allies to make U.S. forces more mobile and distributed.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington did not directly address the Reuters report, but a spokesperson said the United States should \"stop enhancing military contact with the Taiwan region\" and \"stop creating factors that could heighten tensions in the Taiwan Strait.\"\n\nThe Australian embassy in Washington referred questions to the Ministry of Defense, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCritics say Washington's network is still too concentrated and that the government hasn't put enough money or urgency toward the effort.\n\n\"When you really dig down a couple of layers, the intel community is blinking red as far as for the next five years. And yet some of these timelines (to address the risks) are 10, 15, 20 years long,\" said Congressman Mike Waltz, a Republican who leads the House subcommittee overseeing military logistics and readiness.\n\n\"There's a mismatch there.\"\n\nRISKS FOR THE U.S.\n\nThe U.S. military's logistics arm, U.S. Transportation Command (TransCom), has had a major success: funneling more than 660 million pounds of equipment and over 2 million rounds of artillery to the Ukrainian military in its war with Russia.\n\nSupporting Taiwan, roughly 100 miles from the coast of China, would be orders of magnitude harder, U.S. officials and experts acknowledge.\n\nThe U.S. has not formally said it would intervene if China were to attack Taiwan but President Joe Biden has repeatedly suggested he would deploy U.S. troops to defend the island.\n\nXi has ordered his military to be ready to take Taiwan by 2027, U.S. officials say. But many analysts see that as an attempt to galvanize his military rather than a timeline for invasion.\n\nA senior U.S. military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said supplies of ammunition are at the top of the list of priorities in the Indo-Pacific, followed by fuel, food and spare parts for equipment. \"If we run out of the things to shoot ... that's going to be an immediate problem,\" the official said, adding planning for a Taiwan contingency was already well underway.\n\nU.S. officials warn that in a major conflict Navy ships could quickly run out of missile defenses.\n\nIn a war game run for Congress in April, China prepared for an amphibious assault on Taiwan with massive air and missile strikes against U.S. bases in the region. That included the U.S. naval base on the Japanese island of Okinawa and the Yokota Air Base in western Tokyo.\n\nThe potential impact of attacks on U.S. logistics hubs, refueling ships and aerial refueling tankers, was a \"wake up call\" for many lawmakers, said Becca Wasser at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank, which ran the war game.\n\n\"China is going to purposely go after some of the logistics nodes to make it difficult for the United States to sustain operations in the Indo-Pacific,\" Wasser said.\n\nTo address such vulnerabilities, the U.S. military is looking to places like Australia as more secure locations to stockpile equipment, even as it expands cooperation with the Philippines, Japan and other partners in the Pacific.\n\nThe Biden administration announced in July the United States would also create an interim logistics center in Bandiana, Australia, with the aim of eventually creating an \"enduring logistics support area\" in Queensland.\n\nAccording to an internal U.S. military document seen by Reuters, the facilities in Bandiana could hold more than 300 vehicles and had 800 pallet positions.\n\nIn July, the U.S. Air Force carried out Mobility Guardian 23, an exercise in the Indo-Pacific with Australia, Canada, France, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom that included practicing air refueling and medical evacuations.\n\nThe military used the opportunity to leave behind equipment, including in Guam. That gear helped forces there deal with fallout from the recent Typhoon Mawar but would also be useful in any future conflict, said Air Force Major General Darren Cole, the director of operations at Air Mobility Command.\n\nCole noted his command was responsible not just for disaster relief but contingencies \"all the way up to full combat operations, full scale major war.\"\n\nFROM 'JUST IN TIME' TO 'JUST IN CASE'\n\nThere has been a shift in the United States military's thinking. For decades, the United States has not had to worry about a foreign power targeting its logistics bases. That allowed planners to focus on efficiency, adopting the \"just-in-time\" logistics model common among private-sector manufacturers.\n\nThat approach led to the cost-saving decision to create mega-bases, like Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Ramstein was safe from Taliban and Islamic State attacks.\n\nBut a conflict with China could make mega bases, which include Camp Humphreys near Seoul, prime targets. This risk is prompting the switch to a more costly approach to logistics that includes dispersing U.S. stockpiles and pre-positioning supplies around the region.\n\n\"Instead of planning for efficiency, you probably (need) to plan for effectiveness, and move from 'Just in time' to 'Just in case,'\" said Rear Admiral Dion English, one of the Pentagon's top logistics officers.\n\nThe U.S. did this in Europe after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, pre-positioning stocks and investing in bases and airfields that deploying U.S. troops could use if needed. In the five years leading up to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Pentagon requested $11.65 billion in funding from Congress to preposition equipment in Europe.\n\nBy contrast, a Reuters analysis of the Pentagon's budget request found that the military currently plans to only ask for $2.5 billion from fiscal year 2023 to 2027 to preposition equipment and fuel and improve logistics in Asia. The Pentagon has an annual budget of about $842 billion currently.\n\nAnother costly problem is the aging fleet of U.S. transport ships. The average age of the ships designed to carry heavy cargo, like tanks, into a conflict zone is 44 years with some older than 50 years.\n\nOne blistering analysis by CNAS concluded: \"The Department of Defense has systematically underinvested in logistics in terms of money, mental energy, physical assets, and personnel.\"\n\nSenator Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the Pentagon and Congress needed far more focus on Pacific bases and logistics.\n\n\"Our ability to deter conflict in the Western Pacific over the next five years is not close to where it needs to be,\" he told Reuters.\n\n(Reporting by Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali; Editing by Don Durfee and Claudia Parsons)"}

Tina Kotek, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and Multnomah County Chair Jessica Vega Pederson made the declaration for a 90-day period during which collaboration and response will come from a command center downtown. The three governments are directing their agencies to work with first responders in connecting people addicted to the synthetic opioid with resources including drug treatment programs and to crack down on drug sales.\n\n\u201cOur country and our state have never seen a drug this deadly addictive, and all are grappling with how to respond,\u201d Kotek said in a statement.\n\nThe declaration is a recommendation from a governor-established task force that met for several months last year to determine ways to rejuvenate downtown Portland.\n\nPeople addicted to fentanyl who interact with first responders in Portland\u2019s downtown in the next 90 days will be triaged by this new command center. Staff can connect people with various resources from a bed in a drug treatment center to meeting with a behavioral health clinician to help with registering for food stamps.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\n\u201cWe cannot underestimate the tremendous value of bringing leaders from different disciplines in a room on a daily basis who all account for a different part of the solution,\u201d Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said in a statement.\n\nMike Myers, the director of Portland\u2019s Community Safety Division, will head the city\u2019s command team. Nathan Reynolds, deputy policy chief at the state\u2019s Office of Resilience and Emergency Management, will be the state\u2019s incident commander.\n\nThe effort also extends the Portland Police Bureau\u2019s partnership with Oregon State Police to jointly patrol downtown streets for fentanyl sales. It additionally kicks off information campaigns centered on drug use prevention and recovery programs across the region. The county will expand outreach and training on how to administer Narcan, an overdose-reversal drug.\n\nThe program doesn\u2019t establish any goals to measure success. Kotek said the next 90 days will provide a road map for the next steps.\n\nThe synthetic opioid addiction and overdose crisis that has gripped the U.S. for over two decades has left governments at the federal, state and local levels scrambling for solutions.\n\nAt the state level, Oregon lawmakers have introduced a new bill that would undo a key part of the state\u2019s drug decriminalization law. Public opinion has soured on it as public drug use has become more visible because of growing homelessness.\n\nAnd President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced last fall that China was telling its chemical companies to restrict shipments to Latin America and elsewhere of the materials used to produce fentanyl, which is largely finished in Mexico and then smuggled into the U.S."}

Getting a full tank of gas takes mere minutes, but charging an EV is more time-consuming. Furthermore, the exact amount of time required to charge an EV can vary dramatically based on different factors. Completing the task can take as little as 15 minutes or as long as 40 hours or more.\n\nSo, which variables play a role in determining how long it takes to charge an electric car? A lot depends on the battery size and the charger you use. The chargepoint speed also impacts the time it takes to refuel an EV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet's take a closer look at the factors affecting EV charging time.\n\nThe Bigger the Battery, the Longer the Charging Time\n\nThe battery provides the energy needed to power an EV's motor. The larger the battery is, the more energy it can store, so battery size is directly related to driving range. Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) have much smaller batteries than all-electric models, which is reflected in the driving range differences between the two types of vehicles. PHEVs typically travel up to 40 or so miles on electric power, while fully electric vehicles from brands like Lucid and Tesla have driving ranges that can exceed 400 miles.\n\n\n\nTesla Inc. Tesla Home Charger\n\nSince smaller batteries store less energy than larger ones, it takes less time to recharge them. As a result, PHEVs, with their relatively tiny batteries, can be charged in as little as two hours at home using a Level 2 charger. All-electric cars have more robust batteries than their PHEV counterparts and may require seven hours or more of refueling time using Level 2 charging.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's some more information about driving range and Level 2 charging time regarding popular plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles:\n\nAs the table above illustrates, the vehicles with the most range (and, as a result, the biggest batteries) tend to take the most amount of time to charge.\n\nCharging Method Impacts Charging Time\n\nThere are different ways of charging EVs. Let's examine each approach and look at how the charging times vary.\n\nLevel 1 Charging\n\nCharging your EV at home is convenient since you can do it overnight. At home, you can charge using a 120-volt connection. This is known as Level 1 charging and is the slowest way to charge your EV.\n\nWith this charging method, you recoup only 3 to 5 miles of driving range per hour. That means it can take 5 hours or more to charge a PHEV. The charging time for a fully electric vehicle can run as long as 30 to 50 hours or more.\n\nHere are some Level 1 charging times for popular EVs and plug-in hybrids:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPowertrain\n\nTop All-Electric Driving Range\n\nLevel 1 Charging Time\n\n2023 Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid\n\nPHEV\n\n37 miles\n\n10.5 hours\n\n2024 Kia Niro EV\n\nEV\n\n253 miles\n\n57 hours\n\n2024 Nissan Leaf\n\nEV\n\n212 miles\n\n60 hours\n\n\n\nThe table shows that Level 1 charging can take two days or more for some all-electric vehicles. For that reason, some EV manufacturers recommend against using this charging method.\n\nLevel 2 Charging\n\nLevel 2 charging operates at a higher rate than Level 1. In residential applications, this type of charging requires a 240-volt outlet. Level 2 charging is also found in commercial settings; in that situation, a 208-volt outlet is required.\n\nIf you're using Level 2 charging at home, it may or may not involve a wall box. Installing a wall box hastens the charging process, making it significantly quicker than it would otherwise be. Level 2 charging is also available at some workplaces and public charging stations. With this type of charging, you can charge a fully electric vehicle to 80% from empty in 4 to 10 hours. With a PHEV, Level 2 charging can take 1 to 2 hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe've already looked at some Level 2 charging times for popular vehicles, but let's examine a few more to give us an even better sense of how long it takes to charge using this very popular method.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDirect Current (DC) Fast Charging\n\nWhether you're recouping range on a Tesla or a Kia, DC fast charging is the quickest way to refuel your EV. It requires a 480-volt connection, so it's not viable for home use. Also, not all EVs are equipped for DC fast charging; while the newest models typically facilitate this type of refueling, some older models may not.\n\nYou'll find DC fast charging stations at shopping centers, supermarkets, theaters and coffee shops. Refueling an all-electric vehicle to 80% with this charging method takes as little as 20 minutes to one hour. Most plug-in hybrids aren't equipped to handle DC fast charging.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNote that most EV manufacturers recommend charging to no more than 80% when DC fast charging is employed for everyday use; this is done to preserve the life of the battery. Exceptions can be made on long road trips. Also, the charging speed at DC fast chargers slows down significantly once you've charged to 80% capacity. This is done to protect the battery.\n\n\n\nFord Motor Company 2023 Mustang Mach-E GT\n\nNot all fast chargers are cut from the same cloth. The charging speed will depend on the power output of the DC fast charger. That output ranges from 15 kW to over 350 kW; the higher the output, the quicker the refueling time.\n\nJust as output varies among DC fast chargers, so too does the charging rate vary among vehicles. You can only refuel a vehicle's battery at the maximum charging rate the vehicle will accommodate. For example, if your vehicle's maximum charging rate is 130 kW, you won't charge it any faster by using a 350-kW DC fast charger.\n\nWith DC fast charging, the battery's current amount of charge can also impact charge time. The charging time will obviously take longer if, for example, you are charging from 5% versus from 25%. Also, the charging time will slow down considerably if you're refueling your EV past 80% capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLastly, weather and environmental conditions can impact DC fast charging times. Colder temperatures can increase the amount of time it takes to replenish the charge in your EV's battery."}

It requires a significant commitment of time and effort to screen hundreds of stocks based on metrics like price-to-book, price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios.\n\nFor the shortlisted value candidates, investors must then conduct in-depth research into each company's fundamentals, including a thorough analysis of financial statements and a deep dive into their competitive advantages. Essentially, this process can be akin to a full-time job, demanding a high level of expertise and dedication.\n\nAn increasingly popular alternative to this labor-intensive process is investing in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that focus on value stocks. These ETFs employ various strategies to construct a portfolio of value stocks, whether it's following an external index, using a proprietary rules-based methodology or relying on the active discretion of the fund manager.\n\nEach of these approaches aims to systematically isolate the \"value premium,\" as identified by economists Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, a factor recognized as a driver of long-term investment returns.\n\n\"The value premium is underpinned by straightforward logic: All else being equal, paying a lower price for a stock and its future cash flows can lead to higher expected returns,\" says Marlena Lee, global head of investment solutions at Dimensional Fund Advisors. \"Solutions designed around the drivers of higher expected returns \u2013 including value \u2013 can be a sensible way to orient portfolios to potentially outperform benchmarks.\"\n\nBy investing in these value ETFs, individuals can benefit from the principles of value investing without the exhaustive work of stock picking and analysis. It allows investors to leverage the expertise of seasoned professionals, often at increasingly lower costs. This approach democratizes access to value investing, making it more feasible for a broader range of investors.\n\nHere are seven of the best value ETFs to buy and hold in 2024:\n\n\n\nFund Expense ratio Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Value ETF (ticker: SCHV) 0.04% Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (AVLV) 0.15% Roundhill Acquirers Deep Value ETF (DEEP) 0.80% Dimensional U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (DFSV) 0.31% Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (AVUV) 0.25% Dimensional Emerging Markets Value ETF (DFEV) 0.43% Avantis All Equity Markets Value ETF (AVGV) 0.26%\n\nSchwab U.S. Large-Cap Value ETF (SCHV)\n\n\"If you are looking at a long-term, buy-and-hold retirement investment, consider a passive value ETF,\" says Anessa Custovic, chief investment officer at Cardinal Retirement Planning Inc. \"These will track an index and have lower fees than an actively managed ETF.\" A great example is SCHV, which uses the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index for its benchmark at a 0.04% expense ratio.\n\nSCHV's portfolio is highly diverse, with over 500 holdings at present. The ETF's index is market-capitalization-weighted, which results in a tilt toward large-cap value stocks. Notable top holdings in SCHV currently include Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Procter & Gamble Co. (PG).\n\nAvantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (AVLV)\n\n\"Large-cap companies represent a big portion of investors' allocations, and while segments of the U.S. large-cap market today are trading at valuations well above historical averages, this isn't the case for all companies in the large-cap universe,\" says Mitchell Firestein, senior portfolio manager at Avantis Investors. For targeted exposure to U.S. large-cap value stocks, Avantis offers AVLV.\n\nThis ETF uses an actively managed, rules-based methodology to screen for large-cap U.S. stocks that are not only undervalued, but also profitable. \"AVLV's targeted exposure and characteristics, good diversification, 0.15% expense ratio and strong track record explain why many investors have found our approach to large value so attractive,\" Firestein says.\n\nRoundhill Acquirers Deep Value ETF (DEEP)\n\n\"ETFs are a great way of gaining exposure to the value factor because it's difficult to identify it,\" Custovic says. \"You need a lot of fundamental data and intensive bottom-up analysis to identify a potential value stock, and most retail investors don't have the expertise or time to do this.\" A more advanced value ETF that goes beyond the usual value metrics is DEEP, which uses the \"acquirers multiple.\"\n\nDEEP's benchmark, the Acquirers Deep Value Index, screens for 100 micro- and small-cap stocks deemed to be undervalued relative to their income, cash flow or assets. The strategy is to isolate the most profitable undervalued companies that would be attractive as a takeover target. However, the more advanced methodology used by DEEP results in a higher 0.8% expense ratio.\n\nDimensional U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (DFSV)\n\n\"Dimensional has decades of experience helping investors with our rules-based approach, which incorporates profitability alongside size and value into security selection and uses daily implementation to maintain consistent focus on the asset class,\" Lee says. The firm's current ETF offering for domestic small-cap value stocks is DFSV, with a 0.31% expense ratio.\n\nDFSV's current portfolio consists of over 1,000 stocks with an aggregate 1.2 price-to-book ratio and $3.7 billion market capitalization, both of which indicate lower valuations and sizes. In 2023, the ETF strongly outperformed its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Value Index, returning 19.2% versus 14.7%. So far, the ETF has attracted over $2.5 billion in assets under management, or AUM.\n\n\n\nAvantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (AVUV)\n\n\"Small-cap companies trading at attractive prices and with good profitability are trading at very appealing relative valuations looking back the last 20-plus years,\" says Daniel Ong, senior portfolio manager at Avantis Investors. \"These companies present a great opportunity versus other parts of the market that are trading at rich multiples.\" The Avantis ETF to watch here is AVUV, at a 0.25% expense ratio.\n\nAs with AVLV, AVUV combines a focus on both valuation and profitability metrics. This screens out potentially \"junky'' small-cap stocks that may have lower valuations, but also have shaky fundamentals. Over the trailing three years, this methodology has helped AVUV achieve an annualized return of 18.4%, beating its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Value Index, which only returned 7.9%.\n\nDimensional Emerging Markets Value ETF (DFEV)\n\nThe value factor isn't just limited to the U.S. market. By diversifying internationally to both developed and emerging markets in search of value, investors can uncover unappreciated opportunities and hedge against U.S. market stagnation. When it comes to emerging markets, investors can sidestep the risks of currency conversion by using an emerging market value ETF like DFEV.\n\nThis actively managed ETF targets undervalued equities from emerging-market countries like China, India, Taiwan, Korea, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and more. In 2023, DFEV beat its benchmark, the MSCI Emerging Markets Value Index, returning 15.6% versus 14.2%. Despite being actively managed, DFEV keeps turnover reasonable at 18% and its expense ratio affordable at 0.43%.\n\nAvantis All Equity Markets Value ETF (AVGV)\n\nInvestors looking for an all-in-one value ETF may like AVGV, which uses an \"ETF of ETFs\" structure to wrap five other Avantis ETFs spanning U.S. and international large- and small-cap value and broad emerging-market value. Currently, U.S. stocks account for 60% of AVGV's portfolio, in line with current market-cap weights for the country. This mix is rebalanced periodically to ensure it remains consistent."}

Iranian officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"This comes as a result of internal pressure and also a will by our neighbour (Iran) to de-escalate,\" a Shi'ite politician familiar with the matter said.\n\n\"It was a real team effort including with participation of the neighbour,\" another source said, adding that other Iraqi factions had also committed to stopping attacks but could resume if there was a forceful U.S. response.\n\n\"If the U.S. goes big in the next days, it may change things,\" the source said.\n\n'PRECARIOUS EQUILIBRIUM'\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. killed Iran Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani and Kataib Hezbollah leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a drone strike at Baghdad's international airport.\n\nThe strike came days after the U.S. blamed Kataib Hezbollah for the killing of a U.S. contractor, and some Iraqi officials fear a similarly powerful response could lead to a new cycle of violence.\n\nIraq's Shi'ite Coordination Framework, the government's main backer, includes Iraqi groups like Asaib Ahl al-Haq that fought U.S. forces after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion but have since turned their focus on gaining political and economic power.\n\nThese groups privately opposed recent attacks on U.S. forces, according to five people familiar with the matter, leading to rare public disagreement with hardline factions who felt their political cover was being undermined.\n\n\"They felt that they had their back against the wall,\" said a person familiar with the thinking of senior leaders of groups in the Islamic Resistance.\n\nIn announcing the end of their attacks, Kataib Hezbollah said Iran and other allies \"often object to the pressure and escalation against the American occupation forces.\"\n\nMansour, of Chatham House, said: \"It's always a balance of fighting and showing force but not wanting to escalate too far, so it's a very precarious equilibrium of violence they try to maintain.\"\n\n\"That balance is disrupted when you have the killing of American troops, such as in 2019 which prompted the US killing of Soleimani and Muhandis\u201d.\n\n(Reporting by Timour Azhari, Editing by William Maclean)"}

Less than a year later, the school board voted to retire the warrior logo after it considered research that depicted what impact the reductive imagery had on Native and non-Native students.\n\n\u201cI understand the attachment people have to that at the school,\u201d said said Deborah Kalina, who served on the school board at the time. \u201cBut it\u2019s more than that. And I think we did the right thing.\u201d\n\nThree years later, however, the logo \u2014 a Native American man with feathers, a tomahawk and pipe \u2014 is back after a newly-elected conservative bloc acted on their campaign promise and reinstated it earlier this month. It\u2019s shaken the Native communities across the country who work to challenge such logos, said Donna Fann-Boyle, co-founder of the Coalition of Natives and Allies. When one school district does it, they worry others will try, too.\n\n\u201cEverything could just go backward,\u201d said Fann-Boyle, who says she has Choctaw and Cherokee heritage.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nIt\u2019s a marked departure from the larger tide of communities deciding to change their mascots, a trajectory that has been underway for decades, but ramped up in 2020.\n\nThe battle to change the use of Native Americans in logos, team names and fan-driven behavior has often been in the bright spotlight due to major sports teams. The NFL\u2019s Washington Commanders changed their decades-old name in 2019, while Cleveland\u2019s baseball team became the Guardians in 2021. Protests are being planned at the Super Bowl once more in response to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nBut beyond the high-profile fights to change names, mascots and team identities, there are battles going on in local communities. It\u2019s a rare move for the Pennsylvania district to reverse course, but it\u2019s not the first time. At least two other school districts in Massachusetts and Connecticut reverted to logos that many Native Americans have called offensive.\n\nA number of states have passed legislation to prohibit the mascots in the years since. Nationally, the largest nonprofit dedicated to representing Native nations, the National Congress of American Indians, has worked to challenge the use of Native imagery in logos and mascots. The organization maintains a database tracking Native mascots, and has found that nearly 2,000 schools still use them. At least 16 dropped their use of Native imagery or names between March 2022 and April 2023.\n\nNumerous studies have found that mascots are harmful to the mental health of Native students, and increase negative stereotyping of Native people in non-Native students, said Laurel Davis-Delano, a professor of sociology at Springfield College.\n\nThe mascots are all historic \u2014 and often inaccurate \u2014 depictions, erasing the fact Native people exist today, she said. And though to some the mascots can seem like positive representation on the surface, they\u2019re adapted from a \u201cbloodthirsty warrior\u201d stereotype, which was historically used in a genocidal way, Davis-Delano said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hostile when the mascot exists, it\u2019s hostile during the change and hostile afterwards because even when they eliminate Native mascots successfully, there\u2019s still a backlash,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s still people holding on to it and purposefully displaying it. And that lasts for some years. Most of the time, people shift over and are good to go, but there are people who hang on.\u201d\n\nMaulian Bryant, Penobscot Nation tribal ambassador, remembers having a visceral reaction to seeing the mascots as she was growing up. Mentors in her life helped her speak out about it, and her work resulted in a 2019 law in Maine to prohibit them in public schools and colleges.\n\nSchool has its pressure of homework, socializing and sports, Bryant said. Seeing non-Native peers act out stereotypes, dressed up with feathers and warpaint, adds another layer for Native students: \u201can assault on something core to who they are,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAdults put their pride and their resistance to progress above what students really need,\u201d she said. \u201cThe students and teams and towns are just as proud of the new mascots.\u201d\n\nSome schools \u2014 like the University of Utah and Florida State University \u2014 have agreements with local tribes to use their names and imagery. The Seneca Nation approved the use of Native imagery in the Salamanca School District, due to its location on the nation\u2019s Allegany Territory, and large percentages of Native American students and staff.\n\nOne group, Native American Guardians Association, which has Native American membership, has pushed for the continued use of the mascots across the country. Speaking at Southern York County\u2019s school board meeting on Jan. 18, members argued removing the logo would be erasure.\n\nSupporters agreed, and said use of the warrior head image denoted positive features and didn't erase history. They sent droves of emails pushing for reinstatement, board member Jen Henkel said during the meeting.\n\nBut opponents \u2014 who vastly outnumbered supporters speaking at the board meeting \u2014 criticized reopening an issue that was decided years ago.\n\n\u201cEvery single board member has voted to retire the logo, but one, has either lost their election or chose not to run for reelection,\u201d said Jen Henkel. \u201cEvery single candidate not previously on the board who ran opposing the warriorhead logo\u2019s return has lost. The majority community has spoken on this issue loud and clear. You might not like the results, but here we are.\u201d\n\nAfter a lengthy presentation, debate and public comment, the school board ultimately voted to reinstate it, 7-2. Board President Nathan Henkel did not return a message seeking comment.\n\nThe board's decision and Native American Guardians Association's push, though, is in direct contrast to the Native family in the community in southern Pennsylvania, and descendants of the local Conestoga-Susquehannock tribe who sent a letter decrying the decision. Today, their tribe \u2014 which is not federally or state recognized \u2014 has about 50 members.\n\n\u201cWe give more energy to an inanimate object than we do to actual human beings,\u201d said Chesterfield Hall, a member of the tribe.\n\nAndrea Ligon, a tribal elder, said the mascot is a misrepresentation of their identity.\n\n\u201cThis is fundamentally disrespectful and offensive. We are undermined by images of the mascot that disrespects historical and personal experiences of our tribe with a one-dimensional representation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are opposed to this mascot because they are playing an Indian with no understanding of the deeper meaning of feathers, face paint, chants and dancing, which are all part of our culture.\u201d\n\nKaty Isennock, who is a Sicangu Lakota citizen of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, grew up in the district, going to school with the warhead mascot. As a teenager, she never felt she had the power to speak out about it, or the support of the community. Then she watched her children go through the renewed discussion of the mascot.\n\nHer son \u2014 who is a Sicangu Lakota, Oglala Lakota and Seneca citizen of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe \u2014 wears his long hair in a braid and has been made fun of for his hair. He has started to hide it, she said. It\u2019s something that is so normal when they\u2019re among other Native people, but has been scrutinized in a predominantly white community, making him feel embarrassed rather than proud, she said.\n\n\u201cHe goes through so much, having hair like that, and he shouldn\u2019t have to and it\u2019s like \u2014 you guys have a Native mascot and you don\u2019t know that?\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking to the board, she asked them to drop the politics.\n\n\u201cTo put the mascot away is respect,\u201d she told them. \u201cRetiring it is respect \u2014 for the past, for the present and for the future. It is respect for my Native kids in the district and Native kids that may pass through here in the future.\u201d"}

While the formulation made it harder to break down the drug for users to get a faster high, it did not make the pills any less addictive.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nWashington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said the company provided physicians with digital recorders so Publicis and Purdue could analyze conversations that the prescribers had with patients about taking opioids.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Publicis agreed to release internal documents detailing its work for Purdue and other companies that made opioids.\n\nThe company said in a statement that the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing and noted that most of the work subject to the settlement was done by Rosetta, a company owned by Publicis that closed 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cRosetta\u2019s role was limited to performing many of the standard advertising services that agencies provide to their clients, for products that are to this day prescribed to patients, covered by major private insurers, Medicare, and authorized by State Pharmacy Boards,\u201d Publicis said.\n\nThe company also reaffirmed its policy of not taking new work on opioid-related products.\n\nPublicis said that the company's insurers are reimbursing it for $130 million and that $7 million of the settlement amount will be used for states' legal fees.\n\nDrugmakers, wholesalers, pharmacies, at least one consulting company and a health data have agreed to settlements over opioids with U.S. federal, state and local governments totaling more than $50 billion.\n\nOne of the largest individual proposed settlements is between state and local governments and Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma. As part of the deal, members of the Sackler family who own the company would contribute up to $6 billion, plus give up ownership. The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing whether it's appropriate to shield family members from civil lawsuits as part of the deal.\n\nThe opioid crisis has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in three waves.\n\nThe first began after OxyContin hit the market in 1996 and was linked mostly to prescription opioids, many of them generics. By about 2010, as there were crackdowns on overprescribing and black-market pills, heroin deaths increased dramatically. Most recently, opioids have been linked to more than 80,000 deaths a year, more than ever before. Most involve illicitly produced fentanyl and other potent lab-produced drugs."}

His nomination for the permanent post languished for nearly two years amid opposition from Republicans unhappy with EPA rules on a range of issues, from restrictions on coal- and natural gas-fired power plants to industrial soot and vehicle emissions.\n\nGoffman's 2022 nomination for the air post, one of the top jobs at EPA, lapsed last year without a Senate vote. He was renominated in early 2023. The vote to confirm him was 50-49, with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, an ally of the coal industry, the lone Democrat to oppose him. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, a vocal Goffman critic, was absent following the death of his wife, Bobbi, last week.\n\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan said Goffman has played a central role in developing and executing rules and policies that deliver on Biden\u2019s agenda to address the climate crisis and ensure clean air.\n\n\u201cJoe is uniquely skilled at building consensus among stakeholders and crafting policies that tackle global challenges like climate change, while at the same time addressing longstanding pollution concerns in overburdened communities,'' Regan said in a statement.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nGoffman's office has overseen proposals that would impose strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other industries, as well as tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks and a separate rule addressing fine particulate matter, better known as soot. Those rules are set to become final later this year.\n\nSen. Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat who chairs the Senate Environment Committee, hailed Goffman's confirmation. The air office \u201chas an outsized impact on our lives,\u201d Carper said, with a mission that \"includes reducing climate pollution while also improving our vehicle emissions standards and protecting public health.''\n\nGoffman \u201chas proven that he\u2019s up to the task,'' Carper added. \u201dUnder his direction, EPA has made significant progress ... to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help lower energy costs for all Americans.\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the top Republican on the environment panel, slammed Goffman as a key author of job-killing regulations over two Democratic administrations. Goffman was a high-ranking EPA official in the Obama administration and played a leading role in the Clean Power Plan, President Barack Obama's signature attempt to address climate change. The 2015 rule was blocked by the Supreme Court and was never enforced.\n\n\u201cRarely do we have such a robust record to draw on in evaluating a nominee \u2014 and I say this with great disappointment \u2014 rarely is the record so damaging,'' Capito said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cMr. Goffman\u2019s actions \u2014 marked by federal overreach and job-killing regulations \u2014 have been a disaster for our country,'' Capito said. She called the Clean Power Plan \u201ca direct shot at American energy production\" and an attempt to shut down coal- and gas-fired power plants, including those in her home state.\n\nAn EPA plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants is little more than the \"second iteration of the Clean Power Plan,'' Capito said.\n\n\u201cMany of us have warned about the lawlessness and danger of this regulatory plan,'' she said, predicting \u201cdisastrous consequences\" on the reliability of the electric grid and energy prices.\n\nCapito and other Republicans also denounced Goffman's role in what they called the Biden administration\u2019s rapid push toward electric vehicles.\n\nEnvironmental groups defended Goffman.\n\n\u201cOur nation needs Joe\u2019s extensive experience, knowledge and hard work as we tackle the increasingly urgent problems of the climate crisis and the air pollution that makes people sick,'' said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. Goffman once worked for the group in a long career that also includes service as a Democratic staff lawyer on the Senate environment panel.\n\n\u201cJoe has dedicated his career to protecting human health and the environment'' and will continue to do so \"through decisions anchored in science and the law,'' Krupp said."}

Around 1000 A.D., Tahitians arrived, along with their belief in God and the practice of the kapu system, a hierarchical social order similar to caste in Hindu culture.\n\nIn 1778, British Capt.

As a result, the number of cancer deaths worldwide is expected to double by 2050 to an estimated 18.5 million compared to 9.7 million in 2022.\n\nAccording to the estimates, Africa is the region expected to see the greatest percentage increase in cancer cases in 2050, rising nearly 140% to 2.8 million compared to an estimated 1.2 million cases in 2022. The estimated number of cancer cases in Asia, which had the most in the world at more than 9.8 million in 2022, is expected to increase 77% in 2050 to total 17.4 million cases.\n\n\n\nCurrent estimates from the WHO\u2019s Global Cancer Observatory show lung, female breast and colorectal cancers combined accounted for more than 6.7 million, or one-third, of all new cases globally in 2022, with those cancer types making up an estimated 35% of the 9.7 million cancer-related deaths that year.\n\nResearchers attribute the expected rise in cancer cases to several risk factors. As the likelihood of cancer increases with age, projected growth in the world\u2019s elderly population is likely to lead to a rise in cancer cases, according to the report. According to a 2019 report from the United Nations, the number of adults ages 65 years and older is expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2050.\n\n\n\nOther key drivers include an increase in the number of people expected to face risk factors associated with socioeconomic development, including a predicted rise in exposure to air pollution, tobacco and alcohol, as well as an estimated increase in obesity within those populations.\n\nReport researchers say both the projected and current estimates reflect the inequities found among countries when it comes to the kinds of resources they invest toward providing the care services that\u2019s needed to meet the growing demand.\n\n\n\nAlso released on Thursday were the results of a WHO survey with responses from 115 countries with universal health care coverage that found only 39% included basic cancer management as part of the basic health services they provide, while 28% additionally covered palliative care services.\n\nThe survey found high-income countries were four to seven times more likely to include care services to address lung cancer as part of the benefits included within their universal health coverage systems than lower-income countries, and that they were 12 times more likely to have stem-cell transplantation as a part of their health coverage as well.\n\n"}

A nonpartisan government watchdog group alleged in a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission that there was coordination and communication between the campaign and the super PAC backing him. Never Back Down orchestrated much of the on-the ground-work for DeSantis. It received more than $80 million from a committee backing his successful 2022 gubernatorial reelection. Meanwhile, Fight Right was created by DeSantis\u2019 Florida allies for TV advertising. It paid for ads to attack former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is still running against Trump.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images"}

(AP) \u2014 The Oregon Supreme Court said Thursday that 10 Republican state senators who staged a record-long walkout last year to stall bills on abortion, transgender health care and gun rights cannot run for reelection.\n\nThe decision upholds the secretary of state\u2019s decision to disqualify the senators from the ballot under a voter-approved measure aimed at stopping such boycotts. Measure 113, passed by voters in 2022, amended the state constitution to bar lawmakers from reelection if they have more than 10 unexcused absences.\n\nLast year\u2019s boycott lasted six weeks \u2014 the longest in state history \u2014 and paralyzed the legislative session, stalling hundreds of bills.\n\nFive lawmakers sued over the secretary of state\u2019s decision \u2014 Sens.

John Wherry, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nMore than 24 million Americans, by some estimates up to 50 million, have an autoimmune disorder \u2014 diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and dozens more. About 4 of every 5 patients are women, a mystery that has baffled scientists for decades.\n\nOne theory is that the X chromosome might be a culprit. After all, females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nThe new research, published in the journal Cell, shows that extra X is involved \u2014 but in an unexpected way.\n\nOur DNA is carried inside each cell in 23 pairs of chromosomes, including that final pair that determines biological sex. The X chromosome is packed with hundreds of genes, far more than males\u2019 much smaller Y chromosome. Every female cell must switch off one of its X chromosome copies, to avoid getting a toxic double dose of all those genes.\n\nPerforming that so-called X-chromosome inactivation is a special type of RNA called Xist, pronounced like \u201cexist.\u201d This long stretch of RNA parks itself in spots along a cell's extra X chromosome, attracts proteins that bind to it in weird clumps, and silences the chromosome.\n\nStanford dermatologist Dr. Howard Chang was exploring how Xist does its job when his lab identified nearly 100 of those stuck-on proteins. Chang recognized many as related to skin-related autoimmune disorders \u2014 patients can have \u201cautoantibodies\u201d that mistakenly attack those normal proteins.\n\n\u201cThat got us thinking: These are the known ones. What about the other proteins in Xist?\u201d Chang said. Maybe this molecule, found only in women, \u201ccould somehow organize proteins in such a way as to activate the immune system.\u201d\n\nIf true, Xist by itself couldn\u2019t cause autoimmune disease or all women would be affected. Scientists have long thought it takes a combination of genetic susceptibility and an environmental trigger, such as an infection or injury, for the immune system to run amok. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus is linked to multiple sclerosis.\n\nChang\u2019s team decided to engineer male lab mice to artificially make Xist \u2014 without silencing their only X chromosome \u2014 and see what happened.\n\nResearchers also specially bred mice susceptible to a lupus-like condition that can be triggered by a chemical irritant.\n\nThe mice that produced Xist formed its hallmark protein clumps and, when triggered, developed lupus-like autoimmunity at levels similar to females, the team concluded.\n\n\u201cWe think that\u2019s really important, for Xist RNA to leak out of the cell to where the immune system gets to see it. You still needed this environmental trigger to cause the whole thing to kick off,\u201d explained Chang, who is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also supports The Associated Press\u2019 Health and Science Department.\n\nBeyond mice, researchers also examined blood samples from 100 patients \u2014 and uncovered autoantibodies targeting Xist-associated proteins that scientists hadn't previously linked to autoimmune disorders. A potential reason, Chang suggests: standard tests for autoimmunity were made using male cells.\n\nLots more research is necessary but the findings \u201cmight give us a shorter path to diagnosing patients that look clinically and immunologically quite different,\u201d said Penn\u2019s Wherry.\n\n\u201cYou may have autoantibodies to Protein A and another patient may have autoantibodies to Proteins C and D,\u201d but knowing they\u2019re all part of the larger Xist complex allows doctors to better hunt disease patterns, he added. \u201cNow we have at least one big part of the puzzle of biological context.\u201d\n\nStanford\u2019s Chang wonders if it may even be possible to one day interrupt the process.\n\n\u201cHow does that go from RNA to abnormal cells, this will be a next step of the investigation.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

(AP) \u2014 Dueling legislative proposals in Virginia backed by different gambling companies would open the door for an expansion of slot-like betting machines in businesses such as truck stops, restaurants and convenience stores.\n\nAt the center of the debate are \u201cgray machines,\" arcade-style games that look similar to slot machines but involve an element of skill, manufacturers say.\n\nFor years, the machines have proliferated as policymakers grapple with how to regulate them amid a big-money lobbying fight featuring stiff casino industry opposition to the devices, also known as skill games. They are currently prohibited in Virginia under a ban passed in 2020.\n\nNow, a well-organized coalition, including one of the state's most powerful legislators and retail owners who host the machines and share in their profits, is backing one of this year's proposals to legalize and tax the devices. Virginia is not the only state grappling with skill games, but the efforts there reflect points in a larger debate nationwide as they have exploded in popularity.\n\n\u201cThis is a small-business issue, and one that impacts many first-generation Americans trying to achieve the American dream,\u201d said bill sponsor Sen. Aaron Rouse, a Democrat from Virginia Beach.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nRouse's bill is being co-sponsored by Sen. L. Louise Lucas, who holds great sway in the legislature as chair of the Senate Finance Committee. It is also backed by skill games producer Pace-O-Matic, which has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations to legislators in recent years.\n\nThe bill would set up a permanent regulatory structure in which Virginia's ABC agency, a key revenue producer for the state, would oversee the machines. The measure includes a five-terminal limit in ABC-licensed establishments like restaurants and a 10-terminal limit in truck stops. It would tax skill games revenue at 15% and would not explicitly limit the total number of machines that could exist. Rouse has estimated the bill would create $200 million or more annually in new revenue for the state.\n\nOnly a small handful of states have fully legalized the machines in the way Virginia is contemplating, said Chris Cylke, senior vice president of government relations for the American Gaming Association, a casino industry trade group.\n\nSupporters say that as Virginia has paved the way for new forms of gambling in recent years, including casinos and historical horse racing, it's only fair to let small businesses share in some of the revenue.\n\nAhmed Makhani, who owns several convenience stores and gas stations, said that his customers love the games and that the additional foot traffic they bring creates a safer environment for his workers. In an interview, he questioned why the state would pass up the opportunity for revenue for both small businesses and core government services like schools.\n\nCritics of the Rouse bill \u2014 notably the state's casinos, which are also generous campaign donors \u2014 have raised a range of concerns, from reports of crime linked to the devices to worries that children will become desensitized to gambling. They also are troubled by the scale of the expansion being contemplated. While there were about 9,000 machines during a reprieve from the ban in fiscal year 2021, the bill would allow for about 91,000, critics say, based on the number of ABC-licensed establishments around the state and an assumption that each would host the maximum number.\n\nLawmakers are considering \"certainly the largest expansion of gambling in the Commonwealth, but quite possibly, one of the largest gambling expansions in the history of the country,\u201d Cylke said.\n\nSome opponents also argue the measure lacks an important safeguard because it lets the industry self-report payouts.\n\n\u201cI don't want the stores responsible for keeping track,\" Sen. Mark Peake, a Republican from Lynchburg, said during the bill\u2019s first committee hearing. \u201cI want it electronically sent as dollars are going in, and I'd request that be in the bill.\u201d\n\nPeake noted a finding highlighted in a 2019 study conducted by the state's legislative watchdog: When Georgia implemented an automated statewide central monitoring and audit system for its video gambling terminals, the state found revenues were nearly double what had been previously reported by the manufacturers.\n\nThe session's competing gambling-machines bill would require that type of stricter oversight, along with third-party inspections, its sponsor, Democratic Sen. Jeremy McPike, of Prince William County, said in an interview.\n\nHis bill would not only legalize skill games, but would also open the door for video terminals McPike describes as more closely akin to slots. Both would be regulated by the Virginia Lottery Board. Profits from the machines would be taxed at 34%, with revenue projections in the hundreds of millions per year, McPike said.\n\nMcPike's bill also would not limit the total number of machines, though it would give local governments the authority to ban them if they did so no later than Jan. 1, 2025. It would also require players to use their driver's license or other ID to get a players' card.\n\nIllinois-based gaming machines operator J&J Ventures is backing McPike's bill along with another similarly situated industry player, Accel Entertainment, said Matt Hortenstine, general counsel for J&J.\n\nHortenstine said his company doesn't oppose the Rouse bill but thinks \u201cthe better policy choice is to let both devices compete on equal terms and therefore give small business the maximum choice.\u201d\n\nThe bill, which hasn't yet received a full hearing, is \u201ca little stalled,\" McPike acknowledged.\n\nRouse's bill, meanwhile, has enjoyed special treatment, skirting a committee that typically vets gambling related-bills and instead heading straight to the finance committee Lucas chairs.\n\nRepublican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's spokesman, Christian Martinez, said the governor will review any legislation that comes to his desk.\n\nThe skill games debate is a rare issue that doesn't split along partisan lines, and lawmakers have gone around and around on it for years.\n\nA 2019 state report said Virginia, like other states, was grappling with the \u201crapid spread\u201d of the machines, which at the time were not \u201cspecifically permitted or prohibited\u201d and were not being taxed or regulated \u2014 hence the name \u201cgray machines,\u201d for the murky area of the law where they operated.\n\nThe General Assembly voted in 2020 to ban skill games, taking on the issue at the same time they were clearing the way for casinos for the first time.\n\nBut skill game operators got a one-year reprieve after then-Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, asked lawmakers to delay the enactment of the ban by a year and instead tax the machines and use the revenue for COVID-19 relief.

The state Department of Revenue has sent a form to all recipients to use when filing their federal individual income tax returns this year. The payments are not subject to state taxes.\n\nThe IRS had been saying since December that it considers the rebates to be federally taxable income, which surprised state officials and sparked a flurry of lobbying by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and members of the state's congressional delegation to try to reverse that decision.\n\nThe agency gave the state a final \u201cno\u201d in recent letters to U.S. Reps. Pete Stauber and Angie Craig of Minnesota. IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel told them the rebates didn\u2019t count as general welfare or disaster relief, which can be excluded from federal taxes.\n\nThe rebates were part of a package of tax cuts approved in the 2023 legislative session to return a portion of a projected $17.6 billion budget surplus to taxpayers. Individuals were eligible for $260 if they had a gross adjusted income of up to $75,000 in 2021, and $520 for married filers who earned up to $150,000. Families could get an additional $260 rebate for up to three dependents, for a maximum of $1,300.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nStauber, a Republican, blamed \u201ccareless legislative mistakes\u201d by the Walz administration and the Democratic-controlled Legislature in crafting the tax bill.\n\nWalz said Minnesota was treated unfairly because the IRS decided the rebates weren\u2019t the same as pandemic-era relief passed in other states. The federal government ended the COVID-19 health emergency May 11. Walz signed legislation authorizing the rebates May 24."}

How we react is what matters", "domain": "theguardian.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBggKMJeqezDfswk", "text": "Within the story of Marcus Rashford\u2019s trip to Belfast last week there was a lot of detail about what he did, from how many drinks he supposedly consumed to what he ordered for dinner. Imagine being a 26-year-old going through a tough time professionally, making a bad decision, and every element being plastered over newspapers and websites. Few industries are subject to this level of intrusion, making it important for a young man like Rashford to get the balance right.\n\nI will not condone what Rashford did. It was a bad decision to be in a nightclub until the early hours in Northern Ireland before calling in sick on a work day. Although Rashford is young by any normal measure, he has been at the top of this industry for almost a decade and should understand what is and is not acceptable.\n\nFootballers are, however, judged to a higher standard than most because they are seen as role models thanks to their financial success and popularity with supporters. This results in people reacting as if the world is ending when these situations arise. Footballers should be allowed out to enjoy themselves but Rashford\u2019s timing was clearly naive. He knows he will be recognised from Manchester to Melbourne, so going incognito is extremely difficult. All the same, moving on from the situation is sensible. He is not the first to find himself in hot water over this type of event and he certainly will not be the last.\n\nRashford is struggling with his form, unable to replicate the personal highs he has achieved in recent seasons. From my experience, when everything is going right for a player their thinking is clearer, allowing them to make better decisions on and off the pitch. Manchester United is a high pressure environment with extremely high expectations. Performances mean his place in the team is under greater scrutiny than he has known in years, which can be a heavy burden.\n\nView image in fullscreen Erik ten Hag has shown that he is willing to discipline players \u2013 but also forgive if they are willing to take responsibility and apologise. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nIn almost any other job if you want to blow off a bit of steam, no one outside your immediate work environment will care. With Rashford his extracurricular activities are deemed noteworthy by the wider world. Few of us can review our mid-20s and say we made consistently sensible choices \u2013 that is the nature of life. We do not have too many 26-year-old chief executives of business because making consistently well thought-out decisions requires committing a few mistakes along the way. Everyone makes mistakes, you accept them, learn and move on.\n\nIt is positive to see Rashford acknowledged his error of judgment and held talks with Erik ten Hag to resolve the matter in a satisfactory manner for both sides, ensuring he was available for the trip to Wolves. The best way for a footballer to make amends is to be productive in matches. Most indiscretions can be forgotten when someone is providing worth on the pitch. Ten Hag has made it clear since he was appointed that the discipline of his players is integral to his methods and United need everyone to align to reach the team\u2019s potential. \u201cIn football you need discipline and that is on the pitch but also off the pitch,\u201d Ten Hag said on Wednesday. He also said that \u201cevery top professional knows what is required\u201d. Those abiding by the rules will be annoyed by those who flout them, although Rashford is not the first to fall the wrong side of the line at United.\n\nThere will be a sense of frustration in the dressing room at United and Rashford will need to answer to teammates who may feel let down by an important member of the squad who can make the difference between winning and losing. I would be disappointed if my teammate was unable to train after being in a nightclub, regardless of the legitimacy of their illness. But the other part of me would be thinking I need to check in with this player and find out why they did it, and ask if everything else is OK in my teammate\u2019s life. I think the human side in my thought process would kick in because you have to look out for your teammate and colleague.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

United will, at the same time, be trying desperately to qualify for the Champions League against the backdrop of the Ineos investment, which could bring major changes, and I am sure Rashford would want to be at the forefront of a new era at the club he has grown up with.\n\nRashford was in the wrong and, importantly, he knows it. He also knows the best way to make it up to the fans, his teammates and coaches is by doing his day job to the best of his ability. Making smart decisions is not just about knowing when to pass or shoot; it comes in all aspects of life for footballers who are under the microscope. Mistakes are part of the rich tapestry of life and most important is what we learn from them."}

According to Ben Jamal, the director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), senior officers liaising with them claimed to have been unable to consult with government offices and businesses about the disruption.\n\nThe Met refused to engage in any further discussion with the organisers of the protests, Jamal said. \u201cThe rationale that was given was: \u2018We have not fully consulted with the stakeholders in Whitehall,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we press [them and say], \u2018Well, who is it that you need to consult with?\u2019 [they say] it is government offices that are based on Whitehall and businesses.\n\n\u201cWell, I think everybody knows there\u2019s a tiny handful of businesses on Whitehall. And the second rationale was: \u2018Well, we haven\u2019t worked out our dispersal plan.\u2019 And our response to that was, well, it would be the same dispersal plan that we\u2019ve operated five or six times before.\n\n\u201cThe numbers require it because it increases the sort of flow particularly when you\u2019re talking about Trafalgar Square and \u2026 it gives people more exit points, it makes dispersal easier and it prevents any sort of crushing, where everybody is trying to get to one point.\u201d\n\nJamal claimed that the Met was under pressure from the government to restrict the marches, which began after the start of the war in Gaza. The war was sparked by Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 were killed.\n\n\u201cThey have responded to that by being increasingly politicised and repressive in the way that they are policing our marches and other protests as well,\u201d Jamal claimed.\n\nIn November, Rowley defied calls for a ban on a pro-Palestinian march through London on Armistice Day as he insisted on the independence of his force.\n\nA Met spokesperson said: \u201cWe must balance the rights of protesters with the rights of others. The scale and frequency of marches is causing serious disruption to many Londoners. We do not support a request to extend the march into Whitehall.

Quentin had shot a little scene but it was overshot \u2013 too many angles, too much everything. I talked to him and said: \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. Surround yourself with really good people that you trust, who are more experienced than you, and listen to them. It makes such a difference.\u201d Now, he\u2019s so successful and famous that I can\u2019t even get him on the phone. I love watching his movies. I think he\u2019s utterly brilliant, but I don\u2019t think it would be a good marriage, he being him and me being me.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018I was, in many ways, the freest of all the Pythons\u2019 \u2026 Gilliam (left) with Neil Innes, Eric Idle and Terry Jones. Photograph: Pierre Vauthey/Sygma/Getty Images\n\nYou\u2019ve said you\u2019d rather be more like Stanley Kubrick than Steven Spielberg, comparing the thought-provoking ending of 2001: A Space Odyssey to the happy ending of Schindler\u2019s List. Do you still agree? And what do you think is the best ending you\u2019ve created? Jamester\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any comparison. Kubrick had a brilliant mind and really explored things. He wasn\u2019t frightened of going down very dark corridors. Spielberg is the Norman Rockwell of cinema. He\u2019s brilliant, but there\u2019s always something reassuring about his movies. There\u2019s no leaving doubt for the viewer other than the world is an OK place. I don\u2019t agree with that. Film-making is more about leaving people without a clear answer to life and making them do some work. My movies are pretty funny most of the time, but they\u2019re not reassuring in the way a Spielberg movie is. I think the last one \u2013 The Man Who Killed Don Quixote \u2013 has got the happiest ending of any of my films.\n\nDie Hard is considered by many to be a Christmas movie, as it\u2019s set over the festive period and has lots of Christmassy stuff going on. By this logic, is Brazil also a Christmas movie? NickLockey\n\nObviously, because of all the Christmas shopping \u2013 they\u2019re buying gifts for all the executives. It is a Christmas movie, but probably not a happy Christmas movie.\n\nWhat was it like working with Hunter S Thompson on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Robin Williams on The Fisher King and Heath Ledger on The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus? JimmyCigarettes, Sagarmatha1953 and Prestonian79\n\nFear and Loathing was complicated, because both Johnny [Depp] and I were very worried that Hunter would be disappointed. The worst day of shooting was the day that Hunter appears in it, because he wanted to be the centre of attention the whole time. At one point, he started throwing bread rolls at me.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Hunter S Thompson started throwing bread rolls at me\u2019 \u2026 Gilliam (right) on the set of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Photograph: Universal/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nFinally, the scene came up that he was actually in, in the Matrix nightclub. It was the scene with the largest number of extras and we were running late. He just had to sit at a table and Johnny would walk by and double take, realising he just walked past the person he\u2019s portraying. That\u2019s all it was. Hunter kept saying: \u201cAs a journalist, I would not be sitting at that table. It is far too central. I\u2019d be more on the edge,\u201d but we\u2019d set the scene up. The producer, Johnny and myself were surrounding this recalcitrant Hunter Thompson sheep, trying to lure him back on set.\n\nThe way I finally succeeded was by taking the best-looking of the extras, a girl, and sitting her at the table. Hunter finally went over and sat next to her, but he was too busy talking to her to look up when he was supposed to. It took three or four takes before he finally paid attention so we could get the shot and get out of there before we went way over budget.\n\nI loved Robin. He just was extraordinary. When we did The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, even though the budget had gone out of control, Robin said yes and was an utter joy. Almost everything he says is him ad-libbing. We did have a script, but he would go off track and it was hilarious. When we came to The Fisher King, Jeff Bridges was the anchor to keep Robin and me from floating off into the stratosphere and giggling the whole time. Robin had so much energy. It was wonderful. He was one of the most stunning people I\u2019ve ever met.\n\nHeath was the best \u2013 such a great actor. He constantly found new ways of dealing with the scene. His death during the middle of Doctor Parnassus is still one of the most painful moments of my life. Heath was going to be the biggest star on the planet and then this absurdly tragic death stopped all of that. I still miss him.\n\nWatch the trailer for Brazil.\n\nDo you actually like baked beans? Chappy82\n\nI don\u2019t think about baked beans at all! It was a line that Mike Palin wrote for Time Bandits. In Python, there\u2019s a sketch where I\u2019m lying on my back, gorging on baked beans. I don\u2019t know why baked beans are attracted to me. It\u2019s not my choice.\n\nIf you had complete artistic control, casting choice and an unconstrained budget, which film would you most like to make/adapt/remake? llamalpaca\n\nI would probably make a really shitty film. No restraints means infinite choice, and infinite choice is the most exhausting thing on the planet. I don\u2019t delight in being restricted. I\u2019ve been able to choose the actors, have final cut on every film and have all the power I want. Having more money, I could probably improve some of the films I\u2019ve made, but not necessarily, because finding myself short of money makes me very angry, getting angry gets my adrenaline flowing, and often I come up with better ideas.\n\nWhich Python did the raspberry at the end of the opening theme sequence?

Four decades on, he represents the valley in the Senedd, the Welsh parliament, and goes into the leadership campaign with the backing of the National Union of Mineworkers.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian as he presented his leadership manifesto on Thursday, Miles says the sense of injustice he felt at Margaret Thatcher\u2019s attack on the miners \u2013 plus the response of the community and unions \u2013 led to his political awakening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking for people to vote for me because I come from a working-class family or because I\u2019m gay,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m describing my life story and my journey because I think it shows why I have the values I do.\n\n\u201cI grew up in industrial south Wales in the 80s, seeing the industrial strife around us, the attack by the Tories on mining communities. I went to a Welsh medium comprehensive with a big catchment area \u2013 kids from the tip of the Gower peninsula to the top of the Swansea valley and you could see the families who were struggling.\n\n\u201cI have a strong sense that the purpose of the Labour party is to support that working-class aspiration that I was brought up with. It isn\u2019t about personal advancement but the collective.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Jeremy Miles: \u2018An inclusive vision for the language is part of our politics on the left in Wales.\u2019 Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Guardian\n\nMiles says his sexuality made him feel \u201con the outside\u201d. He says: \u201cThat isn\u2019t something people should feel. The heart of my politics is that people should feel they belong.\u201d\n\nAnother vital part of Miles\u2019s pitch is the Welsh language. He was raised in a Welsh-speaking community and says as education and Welsh language minister, inclusivity is at the heart of what he is trying to achieve. \u201cAn inclusive vision for the language is part of our politics on the left in Wales. We talk about using a little bit every day and it belongs to you as much as it belongs to me. There\u2019s something inclusive and warm about that. We can learn how to relate to other policy areas by thinking through that lens.\u201d\n\nThe outgoing first minister, Mark Drakeford, has urged his successor to be as radical as possible. \u201cI think he\u2019s right. We need political courage to grapple with some of the big challenges we have ahead and new ways of looking at things.\u201d\n\nOne of Drakeford\u2019s most bold policies has been the widespread introduction of 20mph limits in Wales. Miles says: \u201cThe policy is the right policy. It will absolutely lead to safer roads and alleviate pressure on the NHS.\u201d But he has called for a review of it to be moved forward. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t felt heard. We have to respond to that.\u201d\n\nCommentators and Labour insiders see the race between Miles and his lone rival for the top job, Vaughan Gething, as neck and neck. As the health minister during the Covid crisis, Gething has the higher profile. But decisions made during the pandemic by the Welsh government were not universally popular and he will face a grilling when he is questioned at the Covid inquiry\u2019s hearings in Cardiff later this month.\n\nThe leadership race was hit by a minor storm when it emerged that Miles was not eligible for the support of Unite because he has not been a lay union official. Gething received the backing, which is being seen as a \u201cstitch-up\u201d by Miles\u2019s supporters.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He studied law at Oxford and held senior legal and commercial posts in the media sector before being elected in 2016. Two years later he was Brexit minister, strongly leading criticism of \u201cfull-on frontal attacks\u201d on Welsh devolution from the UK government.\n\nHe has attracted the ire of the Tories during his leadership campaign over his pro-EU stance and remains unabashed. \u201cI support the closest possible relationship with the European Union,\u201d he says. \u201cMy personal view is that rejoining the single market would be a positive thing for Wales and the UK.\u201d\n\nMiles says many people have lost hope that things could be better. Asked if Welsh Labour, which has governed since devolution was not at least partly to blame, he says: \u201cWe\u2019re not an independent country. We\u2019re not divorced from the choices that 14 years of Tory governments have made in London. Our economy has suffered, our public services have suffered, the life chances of our young people have suffered.\u201d\n\nHe says it is critical that Labour wins the UK general election. \u201cIf I\u2019m elected leader, that will be my urgent priority: to play our party in delivering that government. It will be a step-change in the life of people in Wales to have two Labour governments in Cardiff and London.\u201d\n\nMiles mentions inclusivity and cooperation a lot. He has pledged to have at least as many women ministers as men. And he will work with other parties in the Senedd, which is a much more collaborative place than the House of Commons. If he loses, he would still work with Gething. \u201cWe get on fine. If he was to ask me, I\u2019d be very glad to serve in his government.\u201d"}

They are known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d owing to their persistence in the environment.\n\nIn England there are no restrictions on the total sum of PFAS allowed in drinking water, but the Drinking Water Inspectorate\u2019s guidelines allow levels of PFOS and PFOA \u2013 two of the most widely used and studied types of PFAS \u2013 in drinking water at up to 100 ng/l. In the US, the legal limit is 0.004ng/l for PFOA and 0.02 ng/l for PFOS.\n\nIn one sample PFOA was recorded at 26,900 ng/l \u2013 260 times higher than the current guidance for safe levels in drinking water in England.\n\nPFOA is considered to be toxic above certain levels and has been linked to a range of diseases in humans including kidney cancer, testicular cancer, hypertension, thyroid disease, ulcerative colitis, high cholesterol and reduced response to vaccines.\n\nAccording to the Environment Agency\u2019s own definition, landfill leachate is a \u201cpotentially polluting liquid\u201d which \u201cunless managed and eventually returned to the environment in a carefully and controlled manner, may cause harmful effects on the groundwater and surface water that surround a landfill site\u201d.\n\nAlthough the quantities of PFAS found in each sample varied \u2013 with the lowest total recorded being 79 ng/l \u2013 the average across all the samples was 19,497 ng/l.\n\nThe data provided to Ends revealing the high levels of PFAS in the landfill leachate did not include location information, meaning it is not possible to assess their potential to contaminate drinking water sources.\n\nWhen queried, the Environment Agency and Defra said they did not know the locations of these landfills because the contractors provided the government with an anonymised dataset.\n\nThis, they said, was because the purpose of the study was to \u201cbuild an initial nationwide (England) picture of substances in landfill leachate that are known to be or suspected to be harmful to the environment\u201d. They said the \u201cstudy was not intended to carry out monitoring for the purpose of compliance regulations\u201d.\n\nAn Environment Agency spokesperson said none of the landfills assessed \u201cfound this leachate being discharged directly into the environment\u201d. They added that the agency was \u201cworking closely with the landfill industry to deepen our understanding of chemicals and any challenges they pose\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a hugely important study that is now informing our longer-term approach to managing risks to the environment. Defra will be publishing a report in due course.\n\n\u201cThe Environment Agency wants to provide government with really compelling advice, fully evidenced, on the scale of the PFAS challenge and how it may be dealt with. This study is a very useful first step but more work is essential.\n\n\u201cThe research is not intended as regulatory monitoring \u2013 as such the names and site locations were not required for this particular work, which was carried out by a contractor on our behalf.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

Dr Shubhi Sharma, scientific research assistant at campaign group Chem Trust, said it was \u201cextremely worrying\u201d that the Environment Agency \u201cclaims not to know the locations of landfills where high levels of PFAS have been found in leachate\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow can action be taken by the Environment Agency and others to deal with the contamination of local groundwater and soil if they don\u2019t know the source of it? Workers, local residents and businesses have a right to know if their workplace or local area is polluted with toxic chemicals,\u201d she added.\n\nView image in fullscreen Experts say leachate that leaks into drinking water sources has the potential to cause serious harm and disease Photograph: Michael Heim/Alamy\n\nPenelope Gane, the head of practice at campaign group Fish Legal, said: \u201cYou would have thought that someone in the Environment Agency would be sitting up and taking notice with PFAS readings coming back hundreds of times higher than safe limits for drinking. What exactly is stopping the agency going back to its contractors and asking for the location of these sites?\u201d\n\nWhile it is impossible to say where the 17 problem landfills are located, there are multiple pollution pathways associated with landfill leachate which are well known to environmental experts.\n\nThe Environment Agency has said that most of the sites targeted by the survey were operational landfills, receiving household and commercial waste which have containment systems to prevent leachate escaping into the ground or groundwater.\n\nHowever, the Environment Agency says in its guidance that \u201ceven the best-engineered landfill sites will leak to some extent\u201d and states that \u201cwhile it is possible that the best of engineered landfill sites will contain and control leachate with minimal leakage, there is always a probability that some failure in engineering will occur\u201d.\n\nLandfills that are no longer operational have long been a concern owing to their potential for contamination. These landfills typically have no leachate or gas containment and limited or no records of the source, type, or volume of waste stored.\n\nAccording to Kate Spencer, professor of environmental geochemistry at Queen Mary University and expert in historic coastal landfills, \u201cif the landfills aren\u2019t lined then they are almost certainly leaching those chemicals directly into the environment\u201d.\n\nSpencer said that when assessing the risk posed by these landfills it was important to think about the likelihood of people coming into contact with these concentrations. But to do that, you would need to know what the pathways are.\n\n\u201cIf you were to tell me that one of these sites was a historic unlined site, and it was in close proximity to groundwater or to a river, and if you were to tell me that that groundwater or that river was also a drinking water source, then that\u2019s concerning,\u201d she said."}

It has claimed that redesigning the packaging will \u201cadd unnecessary costs when we are doing everything we can to keep costs down\u201d.\n\nKaren Betts, the chief executive at the Food and Drink Federation, said it had been in \u201cquite insubstantial\u201d discussions with government for months about what was a \u201cvery complicated and expensive way\u201d of ensuring the full array of British products are sold in Northern Ireland.\n\nShe claimed the requirement would cost the industry about \u00a3250m a year and that the legislation would inevitably lead to a rise in prices for consumers.\n\n\u201cWe think the transition to the new label is going to cost about \u00a3150m and then somewhere between \u00a3200m and \u00a3250m costs a year. None of our companies operate on wide margins. So if you introduce a significant cost, in the end, at least a proportion of that will have to be passed on to the consumer.\u201d\n\nBetts said many companies would not be able to meet the timetable set out for labelling to be changed. The government is expected to open a consultation on the issue on Friday.\n\nShe said: \u201cI think the real pity of it all is that companies are not going to put that money into innovation or investment into upskilling their employees or into pay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a sunk cost. It\u2019s a labelling change to solve a problem that we don\u2019t think exists. We would like proper monitoring in place to understand whether it exists before you get into the place of imposing such a burden and such costs on businesses. In the end, some of that will be passed on to consumers. That will be unavoidable.\u201d\n\nThe post-Brexit deal struck by Boris Johnson with the EU in effect drew a border down the Irish Sea. The then prime minister later claimed that the EU was acting in bad faith when it demanded implementation of the appropriate checks on goods crossing from Britain to Northern Ireland. A solution was found under the Windsor framework, under which there is a green lane, renamed the UK \u201cinternal market lane\u201d, for goods that are not destined to leave Northern Ireland. The latest deal is designed as a further sweetener."}

UMG artists who use TikTok to promote their work and interact with fans can no longer post their own music.\n\nVideos that once carried UMG music now trigger a variety of messages such as \u201cthis sound isn\u2019t available\u201d or \u201cthis music is currently unavailable\u201d.\n\nThe content removal comes a day after UMG posted an open letter accusing TikTok of bullying and intimidation, and complaining of \u201chow little TikTok compensates artists and songwriters, despite its massive and growing user base, rapidly rising advertising revenue and increasing reliance on music-based content\u201d.\n\nTikTok said UMG had \u201cchosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent\u201d. The two companies have not made fresh statements since the content removal.\n\nIn refusing a deal that it saw as not adequately compensating its artists, UMG will position itself as a protector of artist revenues \u2013 but there will also be fears that the decision will shut its artists out of an important cultural meeting place, and diminish their marketing power. Viral dance challenges on TikTok complete with a song soundtrack, for example, have helped to propel stars such as Megan Thee Stallion and Victoria Mon\u00e9t to wider fame.\n\nNoah Kahan, who is top of the UK singles chart with Stick Season, addressed the decision on TikTok, saying with a concerned expression: \u201cI won\u2019t be able to promote my music on TikTok any more \u2026 I\u2019ll probably be OK, right? I\u2019ll probably land on my feet, right? Right?\u201d\n\nBut some artists have found engaging with TikTok a hindrance to their creativity, and an experience that negatively shapes approaches to songwriting. Metro Boomin, one of the leading producers in rap music, wrote on X following the publication of the UMG open letter: \u201cI love the creativity and appreciation the kids show for the music on TikTok but I don\u2019t like the forced pandering from artists and labels that results in these lifeless and soulless records.\u201d"}

In the 2005 film, which was mostly an experiment to see whether the combined presence of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt could set celluloid on fire, the stars were spouses who discovered that they were secretly working for rival agencies and had been commissioned to kill each other.\n\nIn this eight-part Prime Video series, the reimagining is almost total. This \u201cJohn\u201d and \u201cJane\u201d \u2013 played by Donald Glover and Maya Erskine \u2013 are strangers who are ready, for reasons that reveal themselves over time, to sign their lives over to a mysterious (but well\u2011paying) organisation and pose as a married couple. How long will it take them to fall in love and complicate their already fraught situation beyond measure? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nIt is a great demonstration of the charm and intelligence that infuses the whole that they pivot from strangers to colleagues to lovers so seamlessly. They learn they work well together on missions, they grow on each other, then their first kiss takes place under circumstances so refreshingly bizarre that it makes getting together seem not just right (these are two very attractive people, my friends), but a necessary corrective to the order of the universe. Later, there is a fart scene that will make you fall in love with them both.\n\nThe strange intimacies and intricacies of marriage are at the heart of Mr & Mrs Smith and elevate it above the ordinary, if stylish, caper it would be otherwise. Well, that and the performances of Glover (who co-created the series with Francesca Sloane, the producer of his earlier baby, Atlanta) and Erskine. Glover cast her after Phoebe Waller-Bridge left the role amicably due to creative differences \u2013 \u201cSome marriages don\u2019t work out,\u201d she told the Hollywood Reporter \u2013 but Erskine brings the kind of unshowy strength to the part that complements perfectly Glover\u2019s light\u2011footed grace and charisma, which is so abundant that it could easily overwhelm a lesser actor.\n\nEvery episode is like a tiny slice of Mission: Impossible. The anonymous corporation communicates with them only via messages from \u201cMr HiHi\u201d and leaves scant instructions. The first assignment appears to be an underwhelming test run; they admit they were hoping for something more: \u201cLike lasers,\u201d suggests John. By the end of the episode, though, it is clear that they are not to be denied their action needs.\n\nDespite that, Mr & Mrs Smith remains \u2013 even as the stakes increase and the guest-star appearances mount \u2013 a surprisingly talky enterprise. At first, the couple negotiate the practicalities of their new life together. He notes how helpful it is to do the dirty dishes while waiting for his meal to cook, rather than leaving them in the sink; she leaves cannibal pornography on her laptop when it becomes clear that they are snooping on each other.\n\nThen, as the relationship deepens, they tackle the emotional obstacles that arise when you work together in a potentially fatal job. Theirs is a life in which contact with the in-laws, for example, is not merely boring or annoying, but could lead to their cover being blown and swiftly put them in mortal danger.\n\nThere is also the question of just whom they are working for. They seem to have faith that it is working towards a greater good, but this feels naive, to put it mildly. Plus, a passing comment from another agent raises the spectre of how free they are to leave this job, as they plan to do when they have made enough money.\n\nIf I am giving the impression that this is a worthy or sombre show, I apologise. It is not. It is fast, fun and witty. Care has been taken with every aspect. It gives unexpected spins to expected beats and traditional tropes: the disposal of an unplanned corpse; the navigation of a mission in the Dolomites when you can\u2019t ski. At one point, a man jeopardises their situation because he won\u2019t break contact with his mother; usually, this character is a woman unable to resist keeping in touch with her child.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to What's On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Davidoff\u2019s version spread through word of mouth, being reworked into the Werewolf version in 1997. The rules will be instantly recognisable to fans of The Traitors: a small number of \u201cmafiosi\u201d, or \u201cwerewolves\u201d, secretly plot by night to kill the neutral villagers by day, and in return the villagers exile one of their own each day to try to cleanse themselves of malign influence.\n\nAs a folk game, there are untold variations: a \u201cseer\u201d might be allowed to ask what team someone is on each night or a \u201cdoctor\u201d might protect someone from a night-time attack.

But the trade-off for speed is complexity: with the whole game compressed into 10 minutes, it\u2019s not uncommon to get halfway into a round only for someone to admit they forgot to take a crucial step earlier on.\n\nThe trivia one\n\nInsider, four to eight players, 15 minutes\n\nA game of Mafia/Werewolf is effectively a big argument about one thing: who the secret villain is. With Insider, by contrast, the arguments can get a lot stranger. It is essentially a rapid-fire round of 20 questions: one player picks an object and the others try to guess what it is with simple yes/no questions. The twist? One of the other players is the \u201cinsider\u201d and knows the right answer. They win if their team guesses the object correctly \u2013 but only if, at the end of a short discussion session, they don\u2019t also guess who the insider was.\n\nThe game will lead to some of the weirdest arguments as you try desperately to convince your friends that your bizarre line of questioning around zoo animals was just good luck rather than insider knowledge.\n\nThe big one\n\nBlood on the Clocktower, five to 20 players, 30-120 minutes\n\nBlood on the Clocktower is the Ulysses of the board games world: massive, intimidating and beloved by its fans, even if they haven\u2019t managed to finish it. The game plays like the original Mafia/Werewolf, with a dedicated games master running the players through multiple day/night cycles until the good guys or bad guys win. But the master is also an active part of the game, assigning players complex but fulfilling roles such as the \u201cgossip\u201d, whose words kill if they\u2019re true, or the \u201cdrunk\u201d, who thinks they\u2019re another player entirely. Neither small nor cheap, it\u2019s not an ideal introduction to board games, but it\u2019s the one that will stick with you for the longest."}

In practice, this has meant increasing interest rates \u2013 the cost of borrowing \u2013 in order to slow down economic activity. Today, the Bank of England decided to leave interest rates in the UK at 5.25%, their highest level since 2008.\n\nThere are almost 60 countries that officially have a 2% inflation target, including the US, UK, Japan and the eurozone, but where does this actually come from? It is perhaps the most important policy objective being pursued today; you would think there must be a slew of empirical support that justifies this chosen target. After all, the target matters a great deal. If it were, say 3% or 4%, we would probably no longer be so concerned with rising prices, as many countries\u2019 inflation has fallen to those levels.\n\nI have spent hundreds of hours over the last few years poring over papers and documents at various central banks, going back decades, looking for some sort of document that would justify, or at least explain, the choice of a 2% target. I have not been able to find anything.\n\nNow, I am not a fan of the 2% inflation target to begin with, as I am not convinced that inflation is \u201calways and everywhere\u201d a monetary phenomenon, to quote Milton Friedman \u2013 by which he meant that inflation is always about too much money in the economy. As such, I don\u2019t think interest rates help much. I also believe that focusing on an inflation target detracts from the importance of fighting unemployment (or underemployment and low pay), which is, in my opinion, a greater problem than inflation.\n\nBut let\u2019s focus on the choice of a 2% target. After the high inflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when it reached over 20% in the UK, central banks were left scrambling to find some new theoretical model to deal with rising prices. The first central bank to propose an inflation target of 2% was in New Zealand. But where did they get it from? Apparently, from thin air.\n\nRecently, I came across this one story that suggested the choice of 2% was the result of an off the cuff remark in 1988 by the then New Zealand finance minister during a TV interview, who told reporters he would be happy with an inflation between 0% and 1%. This led the governor of the central bank at the time, Don Brash, to factor in an inflation bias of roughly 1% to arrive at the magical number of 2%. Michael Reddell, a colleague of Brash\u2019s at the time at the Reserve Bank, admitted: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ruthlessly scientific.\u201d Brash himself admitted as much: \u201cIt was almost a chance remark. The figure was plucked out of the air to influence the public\u2019s expectations.\u201d\n\nA similar version of the events was proposed, in June 2023, by the Council on Foreign Relations, which concluded that \u201csurprisingly [a 2% target] came not from any academic study\u201d, and that it came about \u201csomewhat accidentally\u201d. Recently, Nobel prizewinning economist Joe Stiglitz arrived at the same conclusion: \u201cMoreover, one must remember that the 2% target was pulled out of thin air.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps the most damning comment was made by Harvard professor Benjamin M Friedman (no relation to Milton). In 2018, Friedman wrote, in a book honouring V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, the former vice-president of the European Central Bank: \u201cThere is the arbitrariness surrounding the current 2 percent target. In retrospect, the paucity of serious empirical research underlying the identification of the 2 percent norm, now quite some time back, is a professional embarrassment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth repeating those words \u2013 \u201ca professional embarrassment\u201d. One of the most important economic policies in place today, across the world, is based on an impromptu remark and very little, if any, empirical support.\n\nAnd central banks don\u2019t seem to be listening. There is now considerable discussion out there about raising the inflation target to 3%. For instance, Const\u00e2ncio himself has recently said that \u201cafter overcoming the current wave of inflation, central banks should seriously consider raising their inflation target to 3%\u201d. Nobel prizewinner Paul Krugman and former chief economist at the IMF Olivier Blanchard were officially in favour of this change. As recently as October 2023, this publication reported on such a proposal by the UK\u2019s Resolution Foundation.\n\nYet this proposal suffers from the same criticism as above: where is the empirical justification? These comments are seemingly just as off the cuff as the original proposal.\n\nWe give central banks too much power over our lives and livelihoods, when fiscal policy, which concerns government spending and taxes, is where the battle should be fought. Using interest rates to tackle inflation can lead to serious problems, as anyone with a mortgage knows full well. John Maynard Keynes once said that the use of interest rates \u201cbelongs to the species of remedy which cures the disease by killing the patient\u201d. Surely we can think of better ways to do this. The only solution, in my view, is to scrap inflation targeting altogether, and start anew with a deep, systematic examination of what monetary policy is, and what it actually does."}

The out-of-court settlement follows a \u00a3150m payout last year in a similar civil claim brought by nearly 900 bereaved, survivors and residents of the disaster in west London that killed 72 people.\n\nLawyers for a smaller group of residents of the tower, senior fire officers and police officers are understood to be in negotiations.\n\nSome of the firefighters were unable to work again because of severe trauma, and the claims were brought for personal injury and loss caused by alleged negligence and breach of statutory duty when they attended the blaze on 14 June 2017.\n\nVincent Reynolds, a lawyer at Thompsons Solicitors, which represented the firefighters through the Fire Brigades Union, said the blaze exposed them to \u201cunimaginable scenes\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe hope this settlement brings closure of a sort for these firefighters, although we know that for many, the injuries will be for a lifetime,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the case had gone to trial the firefighters were likely to have argued that the London fire brigade was partly responsible because of a lack of training and preparedness for high-rise fires and the way the stay-put policy, which instructed residents to remain in their flats, was handled.\n\nReynolds said the organisations that settled were Arconic, the US firm which made the combustible cladding; Celotex, the arm of the multinational company Saint Gobain which made the combustible insulation; Rydon, the main contractor, and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and its tenants management organisation.

Sandra Ruiz, a member of the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission who lost her 12-year-old niece Jessica Urbano Ramirez in the fire, last week confronted government officials on the issue at the Grenfell Testimony Week event.\n\nThe government has estimated that the costs of looking after the Grenfell Tower site and funding the memorial will eventually reach \u00a3340m, but it remains unclear what the budget for the memorial and its upkeep will be.\n\n\u201cPromises are made quickly,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cAction is slow to follow. And the pain of not having somewhere to remember grows, as does the feeling of injustice. Are we being delayed so that people forget?\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday the commission, which is chaired by Paul Boateng, a Labour peer who is a former minister, and Thelma Stober, the solicitor and mediator, also issued a statement which said that issuing a design brief to architects for the memorial was not possible without \u201cgreater certainty around the budgetary framework and about what the commitments made by government will mean in practice\u201d.\n\nThe Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities has been approached for comment."}

Immediately, you face a complex set of rules and norms \u2013 some spoken, others unspoken. Don\u2019t make a mess in the house. Don\u2019t yell at strangers. Don\u2019t run into the street. Let strangers sniff your butt. Only pee outside.\n\nSorry, I forgot to say \u2013 you\u2019re a dog.\n\nSocial etiquette is complicated enough for humans. Even with the gift of language, all of us transgress these rules from time to time. And indeed, some social norms are woefully outdated. But at its best, etiquette helps us move through the world in a way that is more pleasant for ourselves and others, whether we\u2019re human or canine.\n\n\u201cAny etiquette, whether it\u2019s dog or human, is about being considerate of whoever you\u2019re interacting with,\u201d says Susan Smith, a professional dog trainer, behavioral consultant and director of the company Raising Canine. Dogs are not humans, Smith says, and they shouldn\u2019t be expected to act like they are. It\u2019s up to dog owners to make sure they and their canine friends are behaving appropriately in any given situation. That being said, dogs \u201ccertainly can learn human rules\u201d, she says. \u201cAnd we can learn more about dogs. There can be some give and take.\u201d\n\nDog etiquette is more relevant than ever. According to research by the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in England, pandemic puppy owners are struggling with behavioral issues like pulling on the leash, clinginess and aggression more than owners who got their dogs before the pandemic. Experts suspect this is because pandemic social distancing made it difficult to fully socialize puppies.\n\nTeaching our pups how to move though the world involves balancing their needs and tendencies with our own.\n\nView image in fullscreen Illustration: Rita Liu/The Guardian\n\n\u201cDo bear in mind your dog\u2019s breed, as this impacts what is their \u2018normal\u2019 and what they need to be fulfilled,\u201d explains Louise Glazebrook, a dog behaviorist, trainer, author and TV presenter. If your dog is a breed that is designed to jump, like German shorthaired pointers or Hungarian vizslas, Glazebrook says that expecting them to keep their feet on the ground all the time isn\u2019t realistic. \u201cInstead, teach them to jump on and over things you want them to use.\u201d\n\nBasic training and good dog etiquette are important because they make life easier for both dogs and humans, says Glazebrook. \u201cIt shows wider society that our dogs can be part of our communities and are not to be feared,\u201d she says. Having clear boundaries and expectations not only allows us to bring our canine companions to more places, it\u2019s also reassuring for them. \u201cDogs thrive off knowing what is expected of them in a situation,\u201d Glazebrook says.\n\nAbove all, experts say that it\u2019s our responsibility as owners to be aware, and to not put our dogs in situations that are unsafe for them or for anyone else. Training, observation and planning can help. \u201cThe biggest difference I\u2019ve noticed between dog owners and dog professional trainers or behaviorists is that dog owners are reactive and dog pros are proactive,\u201d says Smith. \u201cWe are always aware of what is going on in our environment, and if we see something down the road that our dog is going to react to, we deal with it before he\u2019s even aware.\u201d\n\nSo how should a dog be? We spoke to five dog behavior experts about good dog etiquette, and how much of it is about humans better advocating for our dogs\u2019 needs.\n\nDog etiquette at home\n\nShould dogs be allowed on the furniture? Everyone has their own version of what is right for them, because all of our homes are unique. My dog does go on my sofa, he is allowed on my bed and he does sleep upstairs at night. I don\u2019t believe in huge restrictions unless you are struggling with aggression issues. \u2013 Louise Glazebrook, dog behaviorist, trainer, author, TV presenter\n\nWhat are the basic behaviors and boundaries at home? Encourage good manners indoors \u2013 no chewed shoes, please. Establish a cozy corner, and make \u201csit\u201d and \u201cstay\u201d the royal commands. Reward pup for preferred behavior, such as relaxing quietly. \u2013 Dr Hannah Lau, veterinarian at BondVet\n\nIt depends on the people and what kind of relationship they want to have with their dog. I\u2019m a dog trainer, so I tend to be a little authoritarian. To me, basic things are house training and not jumping up on counters. \u2013 Susan Smith\n\nHow much barking is OK? When it comes to balancing a dog\u2019s need to be a dog \u2013 whether it\u2019s play, greeting or territorial barking, or barking because other dogs are barking \u2013 with the need to be a good neighbor, put limits on the dog. For instance, they can bark out in the yard for a few minutes but then they have to come in and do something else (play with an enrichment toy or chew a bone) or they can bark during the day when the neighbors are at work but not in the early morning or evening.\n\nFor other types of barking, the way to curb it is to address the underlying reason why the dog is barking (like separation anxiety or frustration) \u2013Dr Pam Reid, vice-president of the ASPCA behavioral sciences team\n\nDog etiquette on a walk\n\nHow should my dog act on leash? No pulling, especially towards dogs and people. But we also want to give dogs a chance to sniff and to explore their world and have fun as well. Just as long as they\u2019re not pulling their owner all over the place. \u2013 Mike Shikashio, certified dog behavior consultant, founder and CEO of aggressivedog.com\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018We also want to give dogs a chance to sniff and to explore their world.\u2019 Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez/Reuters\n\nWhat do I do if my dog is reactive? Be observant. If you see a potential problem coming, figure out how you can avoid it. Cross the street, or turn and go the other direction. \u2013 Smith\n\nDo I need to clean up my dog\u2019s poop? Yes, unless your dog is a registered seeing eye dog. \u2013 Common decency, and also city ordinances across the US\n\nDoes my dog need to be on a leash? If you see another dog with a lead on, put your dog on a leash if yours is off lead. You don\u2019t allow your dog to run up to other dogs uninvited. This can be really unnerving for many dogs and it can create issues for puppies who are learning about the world. I believe it is crucial that we stop letting dogs run off. You don\u2019t know anything about the dog or the person that your dog is running into. That is just being respectful of others. \u2013 Glazebrook\n\n(Note: Check your local laws. In the US, many cities and municipalities have laws that say dogs must remain leashed except in designated off-leash areas. In the UK, rules vary between counties, but certain orders prohibit dogs from being off leash around children\u2019s play areas, sports pitches, roads, parks and beaches.)\n\nCan my dog greet other dogs? Whenever you are out with your dog and you would like your dog to say hello to another dog, it\u2019s really important to ask that person if they want that as well, and respect it if they don\u2019t.\n\nNot every dog wants to say hello. It\u2019s important for people to teach their dogs that they\u2019re not going to get to meet every dog they see. You distract them with treats and you get them doing other things so they learn that sometimes they\u2019re not going to get to say hello, and that\u2019s OK. \u2013 Reid\n\nCan my dog greet other humans? The first thing to consider is if your dog actually wants to meet that stranger. If your dog doesn\u2019t want to meet someone, they don\u2019t need to \u2013 don\u2019t lure them, don\u2019t use treats to tempt them. It may backfire.\n\nIf your dog is happy to greet people, I tend to advise the person to stroke under the chin, where your dog can see the hand go, not on top of the head.\n\nIt\u2019s polite to teach our dogs not to jump up at people, while also understanding that jumping up can be the body language display of a dog that feels anxious. There\u2019s nuance there. \u2013 Glazebrook\n\nDog etiquette at a dog park\n\nHow should my dog act at the dog park? Some dogs can play very roughly. What might look like playing to the owner could actually be bullying behavior. The easiest way to tell is if dogs start avoiding that dog, or you see inklings of aggression, like other dogs air-snapping. \u2013 Shikashio\n\nHow should I act at the dog park? Stay away from the gates \u2013 if your dog is off leash, it could get out. If you see your dog going to greet a dog coming into the park, you should get them away from that.\n\nPay attention. One of the biggest issues at a dog park is that owners often tend to think of it as a social interaction for them, and they\u2019re not paying attention to their dogs. \u2013 Smith\n\nThe most important rule at a dog park is that you have voice control over your dog. So if your dog is being victimized or your dog is bullying in some way, you have the ability to interrupt your dog. \u2013 Reid\n\nDog etiquette at a restaurant/bar\n\nShould I bring my dog to a dog-friendly restaurant? The biggest mistake that people make is thinking their dogs enjoy it, but maybe they don\u2019t. It\u2019s important people pay attention to what their dog is telling them. If their body language is indicating that they\u2019re not having a good time, maybe it\u2019s not the place for them. \u2013 Reid\n\nView image in fullscreen Should your dog sit at a restaurant table? Maybe not \u2026 Photograph: Iryna Kazlova/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nHow should my dog behave at a restaurant/bar? I think a dog should be able to go to a restaurant and lay under a table or close to a chair and nobody even knows he\u2019s there. Because those places are not for dogs \u2013 they are for humans. \u2013Smith\n\nWhat kind of training does my dog need to be in these spaces? It starts at home. If you can\u2019t teach your dog to lie on their mat and settle when you are eating dinner at home, I\u2019m afraid to say you won\u2019t stand a chance when out with more distractions. \u2013Glazebrook\n\nDog etiquette in the workplace\n\nAssuming my workplace is dog-friendly, should I bring my dog to work? It\u2019s really important to be aware of whether your dog is enjoying it or not. Some dogs are just not comfortable around a lot of unfamiliar dogs and people, so they\u2019re not good candidates for this kind of scenario. \u2013 Reid\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018It\u2019s important to get the dog the enrichment and exercise it needs during the day.\u2019 Photograph: Dave Chan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHow can I make my dog comfortable at work? The last time I worked in an office where dogs were allowed to come in, we made sure everyone had a little partition around their desk. That way the dogs didn\u2019t have to be tethered, which makes them potentially feel a little more vulnerable in a space, which can lead to being more fearful or potentially more aggressive. By having that little space around them with pens or gates, they can be looking out at what\u2019s going on if they choose, or they can be under your desk hanging out and chilling. \u2013 Reid\n\nIt\u2019s important to get the dog the enrichment and exercise it needs during the day: having enrichment toys like stuffed Kongs, making sure they get a break and time to sniff outside. \u2013 Shikashio\n\nWhat dog behaviors are unacceptable at work? If you\u2019re in a place of business, you don\u2019t want to create an issue by having that dog jump up on a patron or a client. \u2013 Shikashio\n\nDog etiquette in another person\u2019s home\n\nHow can I manage my dog at someone else\u2019s home? Reinforce basic commands like \u201csit\u201d and \u201cstay\u201d. \u2013 Lau\n\nObviously you want the dog house-trained. And follow the same rules as in their own home. Don\u2019t pee and poop on things. Don\u2019t chew things. Don\u2019t steal things. Get along with the other dog if there is one. Don\u2019t jump up on people. \u2013 Shikashio\n\nShow them where you want them to go potty. \u2013 Smith\n\nDog etiquette when meeting children\n\nHow can I prepare my dog to meet children? Teach your dog to be gentle and patient. Supervision is key to ensure tails are wagging, not stepping on tiny toes. \u2013 Lau\n\nTolerance of children is important, because we can\u2019t always control what the child is doing. But it\u2019s also important to advocate for our dog. We\u2019re not just gonna allow kids to squeeze their ears and poke them. \u2013 Shikashio\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to train and expose the dogs to this situation if they\u2019re not around a lot of children. If that\u2019s the case, you have to manage it. I\u2019d keep my dog close so I can keep an eye on what\u2019s going on. \u2013 Smith\n\nHow should children prepare to interact with dogs? Teach children to be gentle, respectful, and to recognize cues of discomfort in dogs such as wide eyes, lip licking, yawning, leaning away or a tense mouth. \u2013 Lau\n\nNot all dogs enjoy children. They run around, they shriek, they are unpredictable, and they can be inconsistent with rewards and hand gestures or movements. I think a great step is to teach children to throw treats for your dog on to the floor for them to sniff out. This keeps the child from being heavy-handed, prevents issues and means your dog learns to keep their distance. \u2013 Glazebrook\n\nDog etiquette at the vet\n\nHow should a dog behave at the vet\u2019s office? It\u2019s nerve-wracking for most dogs to go to the vet\u2019s office. The etiquette here is just helping the dog feel safe, giving them a lot of opportunities to express their choices, meaning they\u2019re not so restricted. Maybe you can ask the staff to text you when your appointment is about to begin, then take your dog out to go sniff, and throw some treats in the grass. Let them enjoy themselves outside and not be stressed inside the office. \u2013 Shikashio"}

What are we doing for city residents other than the human ones?\u201d\n\nThe award-winning tidal park, a stone\u2019s throw from his shared offices, is one answer to that question. Once it was a typically grim industrial harbour. Now a beach of sand leads to the water, surrounded by shelves of varying heights and barriers made with tiles Rotterdammers have removed from their gardens, where indigenous plants will be seeded and left to do their thing.\n\nView image in fullscreen An image showing the concept of a river as a tidal nature park. Photograph: Urbanisten\n\n\u201cNew species are emerging due to the arrival of the nature-friendly banks, like wading birds that come to forage in the silt,\u201d De Urbanisten\u2019s senior landscape architect Marit Janse said. \u201cBuilding tidal parks is also about the lost identity of this region as a natural estuary system \u2026 looking for the balance between natural processes and the cultural intervention that is a park.\u201d\n\nThis work is not a luxury. Rotterdam is a city which, like most people or places in the Netherlands, identifies itself in relation to water. It\u2019s a historical relationship; the saying goes that God created the world but the Dutch created the Netherlands, and 1930s poet Hendrik Marsman described a land where \u201cthe sound of the water/ with its eternal disasters/ is feared and heard\u201d.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a present and future relationship, as sea levels rise and the climate crisis is linked with more severe bouts of rainfall. \u201cIn Rotterdam, the water comes from all four sides,\u201d said Van Peijpe. \u201cDelta cities are vulnerable to climate change, especially to sea level rises, which are happening faster than expected, but also to what comes from the rivers. There is an increase in heavy rainfall \u2013 alongside drought \u2013 and also rising groundwater, often in combination with subsidence.\u201d\n\n00:01:20 Aerial footage shows flooding across Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands \u2013 video\n\nIn December, Storm Pia and extreme precipitation hit: Rotterdam closed its Maeslant storm barrier for the first time to protect against storm surge while other areas piled up sandbags against unusually high water in the Maas and Rijn rivers and the IJssel and Marker lakes.\n\nIt is now explicit government policy that not just water management but also urban development is \u201cled by water and ground\u201d, says floods senior specialist Dr Frans Klijn, from the Deltares institute. \u201cThe weather is getting rougher,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been able to keep the water levels and also the groundwater levels within very tight ranges, but we now foresee that that will be impossible in future. So our water boards already say to new developers: we need more space for water storage and we need more flexibility for water level variations, more fluctuation potential, larger freeboard, so stay out of the wet areas. And we need more room for storage and discharge.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Weaving a fascine mattress of willow branches. Photograph: M.Janse/Urbanisten\n\nA \u20ac2.3bn \u201cRoom for the River\u201d project \u2013 making floodplains at more than 30 locations on four rivers \u2013 is credited with saving the country from the worst flooding this year. The national delta programme is investing in action to guard until 2050, and a multi-billion euro flood protection programme (HWPB) involves 100 projects to strengthen kilometres of dykes, without which, says Rijkswaterstaat infrastructure organisation, 60% of the country would regularly be under water.\n\nBut in cities, too, water protection must meet urban design to create an attractive, adaptive city, says Arnoud Molenaar, Rotterdam\u2019s chief resilience officer. A vast amount of work has been going on, and the city has built water squares, green and blue roofs and a 2km-long railway viaduct rooftop park. The water squares, also designed by De Urbanisten, are, very simply, built in overflow areas \u2013 when there is too much rainwater they fill up, and then slowly drain away so that the storm drains are not overwhelmed. And when the water has gone, they become public spaces again.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that we are not investing in regret measures,\u201d says Molenaar. \u201cWe are talking about transformative delta management, not adjusting things here and there. We have to talk about water safety in the context of all of the other transitions. But also, houses that are part of a waterfront have a higher value, we want a greener city, to become attractive for higher-income families, for companies. And by working in a smart way on an adaptive city, we can also increase attractiveness.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen An artist\u2019s impression of low tide at the development. Photograph: Urbanisten\n\nIt\u2019s an opportunity for nature too, says Niels de Zwarte, deputy director of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam: mussels and algae, fish and macrofauna could shelter under floating houses, while green facades foster plant life. \u201cWe will have to create and design catchment areas for water in our special planning,\u201d he agreed. \u201cThese are also the places where part-nature, part-recreation can have a place and where city dwellers can enjoy themselves.\u201d\n\nFriso de Zeeuw, TU Delft emeritus professor in spatial development, says the only danger with too much of this kind of urban planning is a loss of realism in a country that used to experience floods every year. He advocates strengthening dykes and giving rivers room but says accepting occasional minor flood damage is better than a dictatorship of new planning rules. \u201cWe have become a bit like the princess and the pea, in that if we get a little wet we start screaming blue murder,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many welcome a change in the tide of urban design \u2013 certainly at Keilehaven. \u201cI am in love with nature projects that allow tidal effects,\u201d added de Zwarte. \u201cAlmost nowhere in the world will you find a city with this tide in the river where you go from fresh to salt. That is what makes Rotterdam unique.\u201d"}

Why\u2019d You Come in Here Lookin\u2019 Like That (1989)\n\nThere are Dolly Parton songs that deliver an emotional gut-punch, and there are Dolly Parton songs that play to her glitzy public image. Why\u2019d You Come in Here \u2026 is firmly in the latter category: it\u2019s lustful, funny (\u201cyou could stop traffic in a gunny sack\u201d), insanely catchy, and overflowing with camp exuberance.\n\n19. Just Someone I Used to Know (1969)\n\nConventional wisdom dictates that Parton only really flowered after breaking up her duet partnership with Porter Wagoner: conventional wisdom has a point, but they made some fantastic records together, not least Just Someone I Used to Know\u2019s heartsore paean to a former couple\u2019s long-lasting post-split regret.\n\n18. Tennessee Homesick Blues (1984)\n\nThe Parton-meets-Sylvester Stallone movie Rhinestone was a critical and commercial disaster: this song was the only thing that emerged unscathed from its wreckage, with its Bob Dylan-referencing title, get-me-out-of-New-York lyrics and a sound where Parton\u2019s Appalachian roots \u2013 complete with the occasional burst of yodelling \u2013 scratch against the slick production.\n\n17. Backwoods Barbie (2008)\n\nEffectively a redux of Parton\u2019s 1967 solo mission-statement Dumb Blonde, Backwoods Barbie is melodically one of her most charming contemporary songs, and lyrically among the sharpest: \u201cToo much makeup, too much hair / Don\u2019t be fooled by thinkin\u2019 that the goods are not all there.\u201d\n\n16. Wildflowers (1987)\n\nA highlight of Trio, the first album Parton recorded with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt. The instrumentation evokes old-time Appalachia \u2013 there is a lot of autoharp \u2013 the harmonies are perfect, the lyrics curiously equivocal about the benefits, or otherwise, of leaving your home town to run wild: regret balanced by defiance.\n\nView image in fullscreen Dolly in 1978. Photograph: Harry Langdon/Getty Images\n\n15. Two Doors Down (1977)\n\nTwo Doors Down began life as a straightforward pop-country track from the Here You Come Again album. Then a cover by Zella Lehr was a hit single and Parton refigured her original into an odd, and oddly appealing, country/soul/disco hybrid. Take your pick: either version is infectiously exuberant.\n\n14. The Seeker (1975)\n\nThe best-known of Parton\u2019s Christian-themed songs, The Seeker\u2019s brilliance lies in the way the bounciness of the rhythm and melody snags against the distinct air of spiritual desperation in the lyrics: \u201cI am a vessel that\u2019s empty and useless \u2026 I am a bad seed \u2026 you are my last hope.\u201d\n\n13. To Daddy (recorded 1976, released 1995)\n\nThe cause of another row between Parton and Wagoner \u2013 he didn\u2019t care for the way it tacitly encouraged women to leave loveless marriages \u2013 but subsequently covered by Emmylou Harris, To Daddy is a fine example of Parton\u2019s storytelling abilities, saving its twist, and accompanying message, for the final verse, which shifts the song\u2019s mood from stoicism to liberation.\n\n12. Love Is Like a Butterfly (1974)\n\nHard for British TV viewers of a certain age to hear without automatically thinking of Wendy Craig struggling to suppress her adulterous urges in Carla Lane\u2019s sitcom Butterflies, Love Is Like a Butterfly was Parton\u2019s first No 1 after splitting from Wagoner, and understandably so: a delicate arrangement supports an entirely delightful melody.\n\n11. Just Because I\u2019m a Woman (1968)\n\nEarly solo Dolly in impressively tough-talking mood. Yes, she\u2019s been up to no good, but so has he, so stuff your moralising. Killer lines: \u201cWhen you look at me, don\u2019t feel sorry for yourself / Just think of all the shame you might have brought somebody else.\u201d Ouch!\n\n10. Little Sparrow (2001)\n\nParton\u2019s self-explanatorily titled The Grass Is Blue (ie \u2026 bluegrass) garnered her best reviews in years; its follow-up might be even better. The title track, her reworking of the Appalachian folk ballad Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies, is moving and, thanks to its parched, sparse sound, weirdly chilling.\n\n9. 9 to 5 (1980)\n\nIts rhythm inspired by the sound of Parton drumming her fingernails against her guitar, 9 to 5 might be the apotheosis of her \u201cpop\u201d years, but it\u2019s a country song at heart: the lyrics are a tribute to downtrodden workers; you can imagine it stripped of its glossy production and set to acoustic guitar and pedal steel.\n\n8. My Tennessee Mountain Home (1973)\n\nThe glorious title track from a concept album drawing on Parton\u2019s childhood, My Tennessee Mountain Home is less concerned with depicting the poverty of her upbringing (cf In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)) than celebrating its simplicity: the mood of the music follows suit, building from stark to gleefully rousing.\n\n7. Here You Come Again (1977)\n\nNo one should have been surprised when Parton pivoted towards pop \u2013 her early single, 1965\u2019s Busy Signal, had as much to do with the 60s girl group sound as country \u2013 but the skill with which she did it is startling. Here You Come Again is an irresistible soft rock/pop confection.\n\n6. The Bargain Store (1975)\n\nAmong her many talents, Parton is a gifted lyricist, as evidenced by the fact that the extended metaphor of The Bargain Store \u2013 a lady who has been around the block a few times compares herself to a secondhand shop \u2013 never feels grating or overdone: it is clever and, ultimately, ineffably moving.\n\n5. Down from Dover (1970)\n\nDown from Dover\u2019s depiction of an abandoned unmarried mother giving birth to a stillborn child was controversial: Wagoner counselled Parton against releasing it. \u201cLord, I can\u2019t get depressing enough, can I?\u201d was her chuckling assessment, but while it shovels on the misery, it is heartbreaking rather than mawkish.\n\nView image in fullscreen Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers in Nashville, Tennessee. Photograph: Beth Gwinn/Redferns\n\n4. Islands in the Stream (1983)\n\nIntended by the Bee Gees as a Motown-inspired duet in the style of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, Islands in the Stream was transformed by Parton and the late Kenny Rogers: the songwriting is the Gibb brothers at the their most bulletproof, but the warmth of the vocals makes it.\n\n3. I Will Always Love You (1974)\n\nWhitney Houston\u2019s globe-swallowing version remains the biggest-selling US single by a female artist, but Parton\u2019s original is something else: smaller, more personal \u2013 it was a regretful but resolute farewell to Wagoner, whose star she had long eclipsed \u2013 and, if you prefer your emotions relatable, rather than blockbuster-sized \u2013 more affecting.\n\n2. Coat of Many Colours (1971)\n\nThe mother of all Parton tearjerkers, based on a true story: poverty-stricken mum makes young Dolly a winter coat from multicoloured rags, while telling her the Bible\u2019s story of Joseph and the coat of many colours. Schoolyard mockery ensues, but is stoically endured. Moral: \u201cOne is poor only if they chose to be.\u201d\n\n1. Jolene (1973)\n\nJolene doesn\u2019t tower over the rest of Parton\u2019s catalogue in terms of quality, but it is easily her most popular song, provoking hundreds of cover versions, by everyone from the White Stripes to Lil Nas X, and a succession of answer records. Perhaps that\u2019s because the emotions in the song are so believable \u2013 the desperate pleading tempered by a brief passive aggressive shrug (\u201cwhatever you decide to do, Jolene\u201d) \u2013 or perhaps it is the melody, which somehow, bafflingly, manages to be urgent and unhurried at the same time. Or perhaps it is the simplicity: stripped-back arrangement, live feel, no bridge or middle eight, just emotional punch."}

They looked real enough to me, induced by having her motives impugned and of watching what was left of her legacy leach away under Jamie Dawson KC\u2019s questioning.\n\nThe former first minister was willing to admit to errors of judgment. What she could not accept was that she had ever acted in anything other than what she believed to be the best interests of the people of Scotland.\n\nThis may be true. Sturgeon has long worn the air of a Sunday school teacher driven by civic duty and a compulsion to take the burdens of the world on her shoulders. But what her appearance in front of the inquiry exposed was the hubris that underpins that sense of moral purpose. Sturgeon was convinced that she, and she alone, was capable of effective decision-making. Her sleepless nights were less a testament to her dedication than evidence of an inability to delegate, which was the hallmark of her leadership and the opposite of good governance.\n\nSturgeon\u2019s control freakery was visible in the setting up of \u201cgold command\u201d meetings to which only a chosen few were invited. This clique did not, in 2020, include the finance secretary, Kate Forbes, even when the economic impact of a potential circuit breaker was under discussion.\n\nIt was visible, too, in the deletion of her WhatsApp messages. Sturgeon, we know, called Boris Johnson \u201ca fucking clown\u201d, a sentiment few north of the border would disagree with. But for all their differences, she and her Westminster counterpart had in common an unwavering confidence in their own judgment. Sturgeon told Dawson it did not matter that the inquiry could not scrutinise her messages because all the \u201csalient\u201d information had been transferred to the \u201ccorporate record\u201d. But the question of salience is subjective. So, too, are the parameters of the decision-making process. Some of the WhatsApp messages retrieved from other sources have shed light on the power dynamics that formed the backdrop to decision-making. We will never find out what the others might have revealed.\n\nThat the Scottish government had an issue with transparency is not news to anyone who has struggled to retrieve information through a freedom of information request; or who followed the parliamentary inquiry into the handling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond, when it had to be pushed to hand over documents.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jason Leitch, Scotland\u2019s national clinical director, leaves the Covid inquiry on 23 January 2024. Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nThe Covid inquiry suggests the pandemic consolidated that culture. Indeed, if the jokey exchanges between Ken \u201cplausible deniability\u201d Thomson, the Scottish government\u2019s then director general for strategy and external affairs, and Jason Leitch, Scotland\u2019s national clinical director, are anything to go by, it was a source of amusement. When Thomson wrote, in a WhatsApp message seen by the inquiry, \u201cThe information you requested is not held centrally,\u201d he was sending up the stock phrase used to keep details out of the public domain.\n\nSturgeon dismissed the conversation as a \u201clighthearted\u201d discussion. But what about the fact that the \u201cgold command\u201d meetings were not minuted? Questioned by Dawson, Sturgeon denied these meetings were a means of bypassing cabinet. But without a paper trail, who can tell?\n\nSturgeon\u2019s secrecy is doubly shocking when set against the apparent spirit of openness in which her public briefings were conducted. Day after day, she stood at her St Andrew\u2019s House podium and set out her government\u2019s thinking. Her clarity contrasted favourably with Johnson\u2019s incoherence, and her approval ratings soared. Yet at the point when she promised the Channel 4 journalist Ciaran Jenkins that she would hand over all her WhatsApp messages to future inquiries, she had already deleted them. No wonder the bereaved feel betrayed.\n\nLess convincing were Dawson\u2019s attempts to show that Sturgeon had used the pandemic to advance the cause of independence. When he cast her divergence from UK policy as political grandstanding, she pointed out the UK government was often the outlier, with the three devolved nations aligned. When he accused her of \u201cjumping the gun\u201d by announcing a ban on mass gatherings before Johnson, she insisted her only regret was that she hadn\u2019t done it sooner.\n\nDawson wasn\u2019t for quitting. He asked Sturgeon about minutes that recorded the cabinet agreeing that \u201cconsideration should be given to restarting work on independence\u201d. She said maybe so, but that work had not, in fact, restarted. He showed her an email in which the former deputy first minister John Swinney appeared to suggest failing to relax quarantine rules for those returning from Spain might lead Spain to block Scotland\u2019s entry to the EU in the event of independence. This argument was so bizarre it was difficult to believe Swinney would ever have advanced it. And sure enough, the Scottish government later claimed it had been written by a civil servant.\n\nOn and on Dawson went until the interrogation itself began to feel politicised. He didn\u2019t touch on one of the most urgent issues: the release of untested hospital patients into care homes. That was left to Kevin McCaffrey, representing the Scottish Covid Bereaved Group. Sturgeon answered as best she could, which is to say inadequately. Still, how difficult it must have been, in those early stages, to chart a course through all the conflicting evidence and advice. And how difficult \u2013 four years later \u2013 to have to account for your decisions in an adversarial process that sometimes seemed less interested in learning lessons than in bringing politicians down.\n\nThere is no excuse for Sturgeon\u2019s \u201cindustrial-scale\u201d WhatsApp deletion, but it was still possible to empathise with her when she said \u2013 through tears \u2013 that she sometimes wished she hadn\u2019t been first minister when Covid struck. Not long ago it seemed her handling of the crisis would be the crowning moment of a glittering political career. But if there\u2019s one thing this inquiry has demonstrated, it\u2019s that leading the country through the pandemic was an impossible task, with nothing but ignominy at the end of it.\n\nDani Garavelli is a freelance journalist and columnist for the Herald"}

The next move in borrowing costs will be down. But not yet. Those were the three key messages from the Bank of England in its latest assessment of the state of the economy.\n\nThose conclusions may not be immediately apparent from the minutes of the latest meeting on Threadneedle Street of the monetary policy committee (MPC) \u2013 the body tasked with setting interest rates to hit the government\u2019s 2% inflation target \u2013 because the MPC had a three-way split.\n\nSix members voted to keep interest rates unchanged at 5.25%, two voted for them to rise to 5.5% while one voted for a reduction to 5%.\n\nIt is rare for the Bank to be this divided, and in theory rates could still rise further. Interestingly, the last time there was a similar difference of opinion was in August 2008, the month before the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers ushered in the most turbulent phase of the global financial crisis. Rates were subsequently cut aggressively.\n\nA repeat of the rapid easing of policy seen in 2008 is not on the cards right now, but the financial markets will read the runes. Assuming the economy pans out according to the Bank\u2019s forecasts, the City will be pencilling in a cut in rates in late spring.\n\nIn November last year, the MPC said it stood ready to raise interest rates should inflationary pressure prove more persistent. In fact, there has been better news on inflation and that language has now been dropped.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Bank\u2019s forecasts show that leaving rates at 5.25% would push the UK into a two-year recession lasting until the end of 2025 and for inflation to be well below its 2% target. Given those projections, it would be a little strange for the Bank to pretend that no discussions were taking place on the possibility of rate cuts.\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that inflation peaked at more than 11% and has taken time to come down inevitably makes the Bank cautious about easing policy too quickly. The MPC is particularly focused on the level of pay settlements and inflation in the service sector \u2013 both of which are seen as good bellwethers of underlying price pressures.\n\nAndrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s governor, voiced the view of the no-change majority when he said more \u201cgood news\u201d on inflation was required for rates to be cut.\n\nThe Bank has been surprised by the extent to which price pressures have eased in recent months and it now believes lower energy prices will bring inflation temporarily back to its 2% target by May. But it then thinks it will rise again to 2.75% by the end of the year. \u201cWe need to see more evidence that inflation is set to fall all the way to the 2%, and stay there, before we can lower interest rates,\u201d Bailey said.\n\nBut as with other central banks \u2013 the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank \u2013 the question is not whether rates have further to rise but when it will be safe for them to be cut.\n\n\n\n"}

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s delivered a great deal, but we only left two years ago. We were a member of the EU for many decades, so it will take time to find our feet and reap the benefits. Democracy is the big one and everything else follows from that. We both agreed the EU is not a democratic institution; it surprised me he would agree with me on that, but his take was that the UK isn\u2019t democratic either, which doesn\u2019t really take us anywhere.\n\nAlistair He seemed to think that bringing power back to Britain was somehow going to empower us, but empower who? All it\u2019s going to empower is the super-wealthy elite. He probably thinks I\u2019m a conspiracy theorist, but I\u2019m not. I think there was an agenda \u2013 the super-wealthy didn\u2019t want to be restrained by new financial constraints brought in by the EU.

To me nobody seems to be taking it seriously.

They face fines of up to \u00a32,500 if found guilty.\n\nThey were arrested after taking part in protests organised by Fossil Free London and Greenpeace last October that blocked the entrances of the InterContinental hotel in Mayfair, the venue for the Energy Intelligence Forum (EIF) attended by fossil fuel executives and government ministers.\n\nCritics called the event the \u201coily money conference\u201d in a sardonic nod to its previous name, the Oil and Money conference. The chief executives of Aramco, Repsol, Shell, TotalEnergies and the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation were among the people lined up to speak and to hand out awards, including \u201cenergy executive of the year\u201d.\n\nLuke Staton, prosecuting, described the moment Thunberg was arrested. \u201cMiss Thunberg was stood outside the hotel entrance,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was approached at around 1.12pm by [two police officers who] informed her of the condition and warned her that failure to comply would lead to her arrest.\n\n\u201cShe said she was staying where she was, and she was arrested at 1.15pm.\u201d\n\nThe arrests were made after Suella Braverman, the then home secretary, used a statutory instrument to lower the threshold at which police could enforce public order restrictions on protests to anything causing \u201cmore than minor\u201d disruption.\n\nGiving evidence, Supt Matthew Cox, the Met\u2019s on-the-ground commander for the protest, described it as a \u201crapidly evolving situation\u201d involving about 1,000 people at its height. He said he was forced to call for a \u201cforce mobilisation\u201d, pulling officers from local duties, to gather enough personnel to police the incident.\n\nCox described how protesters used their bodies and banners to block the hotel\u2019s entrances. \u201cIt looked as a deliberate attempt to stop people coming into and coming out of the hotel,\u201d Cox said.\n\n\u201cIt was a slow build but essentially the delegates were not able to get in or out of the hotel. It was relayed to me on a number of occasions by [hotel] security that guests were unable to get out as well.\n\n\u201cEssentially, people were really restricted on how they could access the hotel.\u201d\n\nAfter trying to persuade protesters to move away from the entrances, and unsuccessfully deploying a unit of specialist public order officers to try to physically clear them, Cox decided to issue an order under section 14 of the Public Order Act. This restricted protesters to an area away from the entrances and south of the hotel, adjacent to Piccadilly.\n\n\u201cI based it on the fact that the disruption to the life of the community was more than minor,\u201d he said. \u201cThe definition of the legislation had changed recently, in that year: significant disruption had been clarified to now \u2018more than minor disruption to the life of the community\u2019. I took the community at that point to be the people using the hotel.\u201d\n\nCox said he chose to make the specific order \u201cfor a number of reasons\u201d. \u201cIt was a very straightforward condition that was understandable,\u201d he said. \u201cMore important, the condition alleviated the problem of access to the hotel and, in my personal view, it maintained the right to assemble and have that freedom of expression right up close to the proximity of the hotel.\n\n\u201cI was trying to balance the desire to get that cause across against the need to access the hotel for all the users who wanted to use it.\u201d\n\nPolice bodyworn video played to the court showed Thunberg standing silent, surrounded by chanting protesters, as a police officer set out to her the conditions of the section 14 order imposed on the protest. \u201cCan you please leave?\u201d it recorded him asking, to which Thunberg replies: \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDo you understand that you will be arrested for it?\u201d he asks her. \u201cYes,\u201d she answers.\n\nGiving evidence, Sgt Tony Sothinathan of the Met police said Thunberg was standing near to the entrance of the InterContinental Hotel with her arms linked with other protesters. \u201cI explained to Miss Thunberg that Supt Cox, who was the chief constable, had directed the protest to move off and not cause any disruption as it was causing a serious disruption to the community.\n\n\u201cI explained to Miss Thunberg to move away on to Hamilton Place, junction with Piccadilly, where she could continue her protest peacefully. I then asked Miss Thunberg to leave, to which she refused. I explained to Miss Thunberg then that if she failed to comply with the directions she would be liable for arrest. She didn\u2019t respond to me.\u201d\n\nThunberg was subsequently arrested by another officer, PC David Lawrence.\n\nOn Thursday morning, climate activists protested outside the court in solidarity with those on trial, holding placards saying: \u201cClimate protest is not a crime\u201d and \u201cWho are the real criminals?\u201d\n\nJoanna Warrington, an organiser with Fossil Free London, said: \u201cThe UK criminalises peaceful climate activists like Greta whilst rolling out the red carpet for climate criminals in Mayfair hotels.\n\n\u201cFossil fuel corporations are most responsible for the climate crisis, and we will continue to hold them to account no matter what the state throws at us. We have to, because nothing is worse than losing everything.\u201d"}

There are boxes of flies with shrivelled dead caterpillars and juicy live ones. It is 6am, and they are checking all hold luggage from four morning flights \u2013 three from Africa and one from China \u2013 in an attempt to stem the flow of illegal meat from wildlife making its way into Europe via this major transit hub. There is a lingering smell of dried seafood.\n\nStaff here are used to finding all kinds of creatures in baggage, from a 1.5-metre basking shark folded inside a box to a whole smoked monkey. But most meat comes dried, smoked, charred and chopped, so it is hard to identify it. In some cases, that\u2019s probably the point. A hunk of meat being confiscated could be from a cane rat, catfish, monkey or pangolin \u2013 or it could just be a bit of beef.\n\nResearchers estimate 3.9 tonnes of bushmeat a month is smuggled through this airport, including bits of elephants, pangolins and crocodiles, and demand for bushmeat has become one of the main drivers of wildlife trafficking. The trade in some species has created a \u201csignificant extinction threat\u201d to some wildlife populations, particularly in Asia, Africa and South America, according to the first global assessment of hunting\u2019s effect on terrestrial mammals.\n\nMillions of people around the world rely on bushmeat as a source of local protein. However, it is increasingly being funnelled into a lucrative organised trade, providing luxury goods to an international market which pushes prices up.\n\nA recent Europe-wide effort to tackle it, Operation Thunder, resulting in more than 2,000 seizures of endangered animals and protected timber during a law enforcement crackdown in October. The illegal wildlife trade is one of the most profitable areas for organised crime and is continuing to grow, Interpol warns. It also poses a significant risk to human health.\n\nView image in fullscreen Customs officers examine a passenger\u2019s luggage at Brussels airport\n\nResearchers tracking personal baggage through Paris\u2019s Charles de Gaulle airport have found entire sheep and calves wrapped in plastic and placed in holdalls, which had apparently been slaughtered just before boarding.\n\nThese were not protected species, but the movement of animal carcasses and products risks the creation of novel infectious diseases, as well as spreading existing ones, such as mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) and Ebola. There is no easy way of testing for pathogens on these bits of meat in an airport, even if officials knew which pathogens to look for.\n\n\u201cCovid was a warning shot,\u201d says Sandrella Morrison-Lanjouw, a biosurveillance researcher from Utrecht University. \u201cContaminated meat from a wet market in Africa can be in Europe in less than eight hours, but we won\u2019t find what we are not looking for.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen View image in fullscreen Customs officers check all hold luggage and confiscate a suitcase of African catfish. Meat is often concealed under dried fish or bags of vegetables and herbs\n\nThe scale of the illegal bushmeat trade is unknown, but scientific reviews suggest it is becoming increasingly commercialised, with more demand in overseas cities and urban centres as well as rural areas. Within Africa, reports from countries including Angola and Nigeria suggest there is increasing demand in big cities, with more people dependent on the trade for income.\n\nAs customs staff dig through the bags in Brussels, they confiscate all meat, as well as all fish that is not dried or gutted, free from insects and weighing less than 20kg (44lb).\n\nUsually, confiscated meat is incinerated, as it is too costly and complicated to find out what these animals could be. This makes it impossible to provide scientific data on the extent of this trade via airports.\n\nAuthorities say some individuals fly in every week, with as much as 80kg of luggage. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s an income,\u201d says Maarten Weyters, team leader of Brussels airport customs checks. Most planes do not undergo full checks on the baggage, as this one has.\n\nView image in fullscreen An expert from the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain inspects a piece of fish\n\nIn 2023 Weyters says, his team found 56 items of wildlife listed as endangered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites), including pangolin, coral and crocodile. \u201cI think most of them know it\u2019s illegal,\u201d Weyters says. \u201cIt\u2019s also illegal where they live.\u201d Today is relatively quiet: 10 seizures, adding up to 75kg of contraband wildlife.\n\nMeat is found concealed under dried fish or bags of vegetables and herbs, and is often wrapped in black binliners. In many packages, the meat is already decaying, dotted with maggots and flies. These can pose a risk to biodiversity, introducing insect pests and potential pathogens to new environments.\n\nView image in fullscreen View image in fullscreen From left: a cooler box is checked, while an official explains to a passenger which products are allowed into the EU\n\n\u201cVery little is known about the true volume of this meat,\u201d says Morrison-Lanjouw, who written extensively on unregulated meat imports. The level of transparency at Brussels is unique, she says \u2013 very few airports in Europe will let researchers study what is happening. The issue is a \u201cbiosurveillance blind spot for the EU\u201d, she adds.\n\nView image in fullscreen Biosurveillance researcher Sandrella Morrison-Lanjouw, centre, prepares to test meat found in luggage\n\nA key problem is identifying the meat quickly, so law enforcement can intervene. To get around this, researchers take a portable DNA testing unit to the airport \u2013 the first time such a device has been used to test bushmeat in a European airport, they believe.\n\nThe technology needs to be as rapid and simple as possible, says Emily Patterson, a PhD researcher in forensic DNA analysis at Leicester University. \u201cThe ideal scenario is someone with minimal training could do all of this.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Researchers Emily Patterson and Sandrella Morrison-Lanjouw in hazmat suits as they prepare to test some of the confiscated meat\n\nWearing hazmat suits, Patterson and Morrison-Lanjouw prick meat samples and pass them through the MinION, a machine developed by an Oxford University spin-off to extract DNA. The kit can fit inside a suitcase and identify samples within eight hours.\n\nOne man casually announces he is carrying duiker, an African antelope, including one 500g joint that he says he could sell for $30 (\u00a324). The DNA sequencing test shows that the two species he had were bay duiker and Maxwell\u2019s duiker, both species listed in Cites\u2019 Appendix II, meaning trade must be controlled to avoid over-exploitation.\n\nThe bay duiker is listed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, though Maxwell\u2019s duiker is classified on its red list as being of least concern.\n\nHowever, both populations are decreasing and the demand for bushmeat is one of the factors driving their decline. Pork, beef and north African catfish were also identified by the scientists as being in the luggage. Other results came back inconclusive \u2013 this could be because the animal had not yet been added to the GenBank genetic sequence database.\n\nView image in fullscreen View image in fullscreen Researchers unpack, examine and DNA test meat from a traveller\u2019s suitcase. The test later reveals the meat was beef\n\nThe bushmeat found by the scientists represents only a tiny fraction of the trade, which tends to favour delivery by air or by post.\n\n\u201c[Flights are] the fastest way to enter, while seaports normally require longer transit time,\u201d says Anne-Lise Chaber, a researcher at Adelaide University. A study she led in 2010 found that nearly one in 12 passengers searched on flights from west and central African countries were carrying bushmeat. Commodities that do not need to be transported so urgently \u2013 such as pangolin scales or the bones of tigers and lions \u2013 are more likely to be in shipping containers.\n\nIt is likely that what is happening in Brussels and Paris is occurring in airports all over Europe. It shows if you want to find illegally trafficked wildlife, it is easy to do, but few people are looking. \u201cIt\u2019s coming in everywhere,\u201d says Morrison-Lanjouw.\n\nFrom Brussels, meat that is not caught by customs will make its way to the markets in European cities such as Paris, where traders can get double the price of supermarket meat, Chaber has found in previous research \u2013 showing consumers are willing to pay premium prices for these products.\n\nView image in fullscreen Many pieces of meat are infested with maggots or flies. Any containing insects will be discarded.\n\nChaber says some customers believe it is healthier to eat bushmeat, while others some find it tastier. \u201cWe have to work with the community and see what could replace bushmeat,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not against consumption of bushmeat locally, I am against the international trade.\u201d\n\nIn 2008 she went around markets in Paris posing as a potential customer to find out how simple it would be to buy bushmeat. \u201cIt was very easy,\u201d she says. In the years since, however, little has changed to stop the flood of meat into European markets \u2013 and the accompanying declines in wildlife. \u201cThe truth is, I know that it\u2019s still very easy.\u201d"}

But Labour has a chance to revive Channel 4\u2019s radical spirit", "domain": "theguardian.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBggKMJeqezDfswk", "text": "Channel 4 has just announced plans to cut almost 250 jobs (about 15% of its workforce of full-time staff), sell its London HQ and drop a number of shows.\n\nThe immediate cause of its problems is the ad market. Channel 4 depends on advertising for about 90% of its revenue, and ad spending was cut back in 2023 as consumer spending was squeezed. But the station\u2019s problems run deeper. A decade ago, TV accounted for almost half of the display ad spending in the UK, and online about an eighth. Today, online is more than half and TV is about a quarter. First the internet swallowed print advertising, now it\u2019s coming for TV.\n\nThe shift is being driven by viewing moving online, as young people in particular spend more time using video-sharing platforms such as YouTube, and subscription on-demand services such as Netflix. Live TV viewing fell from 60% of overall viewing in 2017 to 45% in 2022. Channel 4 has always sought a younger audience, yet live TV represents only 16% of the viewing of those between 16 and 34, compared to 36% five years ago.\n\nTo combat the problem, Channel 4\u2019s leadership have announced Fast Forward, a strategy to become a \u201cgenuinely digital-first public service streamer by 2030\u201d. But it faces an unenviable challenge: competing for digital ad revenue with Google and Meta, whose scale and capabilities are far beyond UK broadcasters, and competing for subscribers in an increasingly crowded streaming market with Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Disney, whose content budgets dwarf Channel 4\u2019s.\n\nBut even if tech companies weren\u2019t increasingly dominating the ad market, advertising is still the wrong way to fund Channel 4. There has always been a basic contradiction between the channel\u2019s reliance on advertising and its public service remit, which requires it to champion unheard voices, innovate and take risks, contribute to citizenship and debate, promote diversity across the UK, appeal particularly to young people, and make films. But the need to make ad revenue pushes it in totally the opposite direction: towards commissioning programmes \u2013 reality TV, gameshows and other cheaper formats \u2013 that will reliably deliver high ratings at a low cost per viewer. Ideally, these shows will also be ones generic enough to be licensed internationally, such as First Dates, Come Dine With Me and Gogglebox.\n\nWorse, advertising can have a censoring effect: biasing commissioning towards programmes that attract the viewers advertisers care most about (typically the \u201cupmarket\u201d ones with higher incomes), and away from genres or topics less likely to promote a \u201cconsuming\u201d mood in the viewer. This leads to a situation where the revenue generated by more commercial shows \u2013 Big Brother, Deal Or No Deal, The Great British Bake Off \u2013 cross-subsidises remit-focused work, like Chewing Gum, Big Boys, Miners\u2019 Strike 1984, Channel 4 News and Film4.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018More commercial shows \u2013 Big Brother, Deal Or No Deal, The Great British Bake Off (above) \u2013 cross-subsidise remit-focused work, like Chewing Gum, Big Boys, Miners\u2019 Strike 1984.\u2019 Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/Channel 4 / Love Productions / Mark Bourdillon\n\nThe trade-off was much more favourable to the remit in the 1980s, when ITV and Channel 4 advertising was sold together as a monopoly, making revenue easier to generate. The advertising industry hated it but the result was Channel 4\u2019s most radical decade, funding a new wave of British independent film from artists and directors such as Terence Davies, Derek Jarman, John Akomfrah and Peter Greenaway, and pathbreaking programmes such as Out on Tuesday, Desmond\u2019s, Bandung File and After Dark.\n\nIn the 1990s, Conservative media policy fostered more competition in the TV ad market, largely to benefit the advertising industry, and Channel 4 jettisoned much of its earlier radicalism. The danger now is that the intense competition for revenue online will see the channel\u2019s trade-off tilt even more towards commercialism.\n\nThere is a solution, though. Borrowing an idea from Sweden, which introduced a 6% tax on print advertising in the 1970s to subsidise its local newspapers, we could do something similar in the UK: a 6% tax on advertising across all formats, including online, would generate about \u00a32.2bn a year (based on total UK ad spend of about \u00a337bn in 2023). That would more than solve Channel 4\u2019s funding problems, almost doubling revenue for 2022.\n\nThe benefits would be enormous. Channel 4 could eliminate ads across TV and online. Its commissioning could aim simply at fulfilling its remit: making high quality, innovative, risk-taking programmes and films that promote unheard perspectives \u2013 and therefore doing what its more commercial rivals are too risk-averse to do.\n\nConsider, for example, the potential impact on British independent film: total public funding across Film4, the BBC and BFI is thought to be less than \u00a3100m a year, which is significantly less than the cost of a single Hollywood blockbuster. The result, as the director Michael Winterbottom has pointed out, is that even great British directors tend to make a film every three or four years rather than every one or two. Yet the list of productions Film4 has backed is extraordinary.\n\nWith greater funding at its disposal, the channel could also make more big-budget drama and comedy series, and win back some of the young people abandoning British broadcasters for US imports. And it would be able to do all this safe in the knowledge that its funding is future-proof: as ad spending goes up \u2013 as it does, despite short-term fluctuations \u2013 so will Channel 4\u2019s funding, and with no need to periodically ask the government for funding increases.\n\nMaking this idea into reality would require a governing party unafraid to take on the companies that would have to pay the tax \u2013 particularly the advertising industry and ad-funded media companies (including the press). Clearly, the Conservatives would never do so. The question is, would Labour? The party\u2019s current strategy is based on winning over business and the press, and this policy would undoubtedly antagonise both. But it would also strengthen one of the media\u2019s few bastions of tolerance, diversity and pluralism, and one of its best supporters of radical, important, creative and innovative work. The prize is worth fighting for."}

Many people subsequently joined civilian defence forces to fight back against military oppression, fleeing to the jungle to train to fight, and receiving support from and fighting alongside older, ethnic armed groups seeking independence. Myanmar has since been gripped by spiralling conflict, leaving more than 2.6 million people internally displaced.\n\nView image in fullscreen Members of Myanmar\u2019s military security force patrol a street during the \u2018silent strike\u2019. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn October, an alliance of ethnic armed groups launched a new operation to seize junta territory, which resulted in humiliating defeats for the already overstretched military.\n\nIt has lost swathes of territory along the border with China, as well as on the other side of the country, in Chin and Rakhine states, and thousands of soldiers have surrendered. Progress by anti-junta groups elsewhere has been mixed.\n\n\u201cThree years on from the Myanmar coup, the military\u2019s hold on power is more uncertain than at any time in the last 60 years,\u201d said Richard Horsey, senior Myanmar adviser to Crisis Group. But, he added, the military seemed determined to fight on \u201cand retains an enormous capacity for violence, attacking civilian populations and infrastructure in areas it has lost, using air power and long-range artillery\u201d.\n\nRights experts have previously accused the military of committing war crimes, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians from aerial bombing, mass executions and the large-scale and intentional burning of homes.\n\nOn Wednesday, the junta head, Min Aung Hlaing, said the military would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to crush opposition. It has denied abuses against civilians, saying its operations were designed to tackle terrorists and in the interests of security.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi, who was detained in the early hours of 1 February 2021, is serving a 33-year sentence over charges that have been widely dismissed as politically motivated. She has not been seen in public since, other than in images taken in a courtroom in Naypyidaw.\n\nHer son Kim Aris, who lives in the UK, told Sky News he had received a letter from his mother in prison, the first communication he has had from her in three years. It said she was generally well but suffering from dental problems and spondylitis, a condition that inflames the joints of the backbone. The letter, which would have been read by the military, contained little detail.\n\nAlmost 20,000 political prisoners are detained across Myanmar, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma), a local monitoring group.\n\nKo Tayzar Sann, an activist in central Myanmar, said: \u201cThe main message that we would like to deliver is that the Myanmar people will never be cowed by the terrorising, power-stealing junta. We rang our bell to the whole world \u2013 including the military.\u201d\n\nHe recalled the confusion on 1 February 2021, as news of the coup emerged. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have phone line and internet, but we could confirm the news in the afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone was sad and angry. No one accepted this action.\u201d\n\nSince then, lives have been turned upside down. \u201cWe have experienced the terrorist killings, torture and devastation carried out by the military,\u201d he said. At the same time he had also seen the dedication and determination of the public to overthrow the military.\n\nMany people were taking part in the silent strike, despite the military\u2019s intimidation, Ko Tayzar Sann said. \u201cWhat we have understood from these three years past, is that it is impossible for the military to rule or control the country. \u201cThe revolution side must prove that with action.\u201d\n\n"}

He even bought his aunt a holiday to Disney World. \u201cI drove to the Monaco Grand Prix in a Lamborghini,\u201d he recalls. \u201cPreviously, the most extravagant place I\u2019d been to was Magaluf.\u201d\n\nWhen 26-year-old Jordan Sangha won the latest series of Big Brother in November, a look of contentment washed over his face. \u201cI can pay my council tax,\u201d he grinned.\n\nPeople appear on reality TV for any number of reasons: fame, glory, finally getting to taste kangaroo testicles. Yet an undeniable draw is the cash prize, which has been a constant on British TV since the 1955 gameshow Take Your Pick! But \u2013 as often seems to be the case \u2013 things aren\u2019t what they used to be. When the latest series of reality competition The Traitors debuted on BBC One in early January, host Claudia Winkleman asked contestants what they would spend \u00a3120,000 on if they won.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything or anybody to fall back on,\u201d said one participant, \u201cso it\u2019s my one chance to get my foot on the ladder.\u201d (She was \u201cbanished\u201d from the show in episode four.) Another contestant wanted to pay off their mum\u2019s mortgage; one wanted to foot the bill for his brothers and sisters when they went out to eat. Only one person spoke of travelling the world. Another said she couldn\u2019t get married because of the cost of living crisis: \u201cI\u2019d love to get married, I really would.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Only one person spoke of travelling the world if they won \u2026 Claudia Winkleman, centre, with the contestants on series two of The Traitors.

This isn\u2019t news to anyone who has tried to buy a bottle of ketchup recently, but it\u2019s interesting to see it affect the dreams of reality TV wannabes. Hutton was a postal worker when he went on Big Brother \u2013 he had just given up his dreams of playing professional football and thought: \u201cIs this it?\u201d He applied to be on the show because he knew it could change his life. He was right. But now, do people apply simply to pay their bills?\n\nBig Brother\u2019s first ever winner, Craig Phillips, donated his \u00a370,000 prize money to pay for a friend\u2019s heart and lung transplant. The series\u2019 second winner, Brian Dowling, has been quoted as saying: \u201cAt least half was spent on travelling, holidays, turning left, turning right, designer clothes.\u201d He even bought a Gucci belt with his name on it. Yet post-recession, after Chloe Wilburn won the largest Big Brother UK prize pot of \u00a3116,100 in 2015, she promptly returned to work. Wilburn said she wanted to get married and have a child \u2013 she also made an offer on a house. \u201cI can\u2019t [waste my winnings], my mum\u2019s got my money,\u201d she said. \u201cShe wanted to keep my feet on the ground just so I don\u2019t blow it on crazy trips to Benidorm.\u201d\n\nOf course, a narrative of decline isn\u2019t one-size-fits-all \u2013 to a certain extent, reality TV contestants have always wanted to keep up with the cost of living. The first ever Britain\u2019s Got Talent winner, Paul Potts, spent his \u00a3100,000 winnings paying off his debts. The second winner of the show, George Sampson, repeatedly spoke about money troubles on the show, saying that he had busked to buy his mum petrol and was \u201choping for a better life\u201d for his family. Producers have long known that some stories hold more sway with viewers than others. Still, serial gameshow contestant Mike Stratton sheds light on how things have changed over the years.\n\n\u201cThese days, with bills rising, the money tends to go on daily needs rather than luxuries,\u201d says 55-year-old Stratton, who has appeared on 18 quizshows and written a book called How to Get on Game Shows and Win \u00a31000\u2019s: Confessions of a Game Show Addict. In total, he has won \u00a370,000 in cash and prizes in the last 23 years \u2013 he spent it on laser-eye surgery, IVF, cars and holidays. Yet he says his latest winnings, \u00a32,400 from the BBC gameshow Decimate in 2016, were spent on paying off credit card debt.\n\nView image in fullscreen The first ever Britain\u2019s Got Talent winner, Paul Potts, who spent his \u00a3100,000 winnings paying off his debts. Photograph: Ken McKay/Rex Features\n\nStratton, a male stripper who lives in Wigan, says that now, you would have to win \u00a340,000 to be able to spend like he did when he won \u00a310,000 20 years ago. His first ever win was on the 2001 gameshow Greed, that was hosted by Jerry Springer \u2013 he answered just one question (Q: \u201cWhat building is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC?\u201d A: \u201cThe White House\u201d) and won \u00a310,000. \u201cWe spent it on a house deposit, a holiday and several other bits,\u201d Stratton says. In the year 2000, the average house deposit was \u00a39,865. In 2023, it was \u00a362,500. To put things another way: 20 years ago, you would only have to get to question eight out of 15 on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? to be most of the way towards a deposit; now you\u2019d have to get to question 11.\n\nNot only has the cost of living increased in the last two decades, prize money has often simultaneously decreased \u2013 most famously when the then eight-year-old Channel 4 quiz The Million Pound Drop downgraded to The \u00a3100k Drop in 2018. When Survivor debuted in 2001, its prize money was also \u00a31m; when it returned to screens in 2023, it had also been slashed to a tenth of its original offering.\n\nEven winnings that have stayed the same have arguably decreased. Though Britain\u2019s Got Talent winners have received a whopping \u00a3250,000 each since 2013, inflation means that the prize money would have to be increased to \u00a3330,000 to be of equal value today.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to What's On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hutton theorises that a \u00a3250,000 prize pot on Love Island would inspire \u201creally conniving gameplay \u2013 you\u2019re going to potentially get people that will compromise their character to get that money.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Still offering the big bucks \u2026 Helen and Charlie won \u00a31m on Ant and Dec\u2019s Limitless Win. Photograph: ITV/Kieron McCarron/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nSome telly is still offering big bucks \u2013 two NHS workers Helen and Charlie recently won \u00a31m on Ant and Dec\u2019s Limitless Win, the premise of which is in the name (there is no cap on the potential prize). Still, even then, the married couple said the first thing they would do with the prize is pay off their mortgage, adding: \u201cWe also need a new secondhand car.\u201d Two decades ago, when a Scottish nurse won \u00a31m on The Vault in 2004 (back then, this was the largest amount ever won on live TV), her first thought was of a luxury trip to St Lucia.\n\nA year earlier in 2003, a student who won \u00a3700,000 on The Vault did speak of buying a home \u2013 but a holiday one, in Spain.\n\nPerhaps contestants these days simply don\u2019t want to boast, but there is no denying that prize-winnings don\u2019t go as far as they used to. Between 2022 and 2023, package holidays increased by 30% in price. The phrase \u201c\u00a31m home\u201d used to conjure up images of mansions and butlers \u2013 now it describes a three-bed terrace house in London. Some shows have acknowledged our darkening days: in 2022, This Morning notoriously ran a spin-to-win competition where the prize was having four months worth of energy bills paid off.\n\nIt can\u2019t help but feel a bit dystopian when people enter competitions not to live lavishly, but simply to live. Though we are still a long way off, we are arguably closer to The Hunger Games than ever before. In this environment, how will viewers react to villainous behaviour on-screen? On shows such as The Traitors, players often excuse their manipulation of others with the oft-repeated phrase: \u201cIt\u2019s just a game.\u201d But if the prize money is a roof over someone\u2019s head or their pension pot, the stakes have never been higher."}
