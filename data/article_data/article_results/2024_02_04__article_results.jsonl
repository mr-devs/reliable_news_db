The men\u2019s scoring record, set by Pete Maravich in 1970 (3,667 points), remains within reach. The record chase continues Thursday in Iowa City against Penn State.\n\nEarly and late in the game, the Maryland side of the Xfinity Center crowd booed Clark when she got the ball but then saw firsthand how the nation\u2019s most exhilarating player can quickly change the momentum for Iowa (21-2, 10-1 Big Ten). She does it with her scoring, of course \u2013 she hit three 3-pointers in a flash in the first quarter to quell an early Maryland run \u2013 but also by whipping or bouncing passes to teammates all over the court for their own scores.\n\nClark, who entered the game leading the nation in scoring (32.1 ppg) and assists (7.7 apg), finished with a season-high 12 assists as Maryland players did their best to front and swarm her, leaving Clark\u2019s teammates open for layups and some big 3s of their own.\n\n\u201cI take it in everywhere I go and I think I\u2019m just very grateful and obviously it\u2019s changed my life in some ways more than others, just being aware of my surroundings and stuff like that, but people spend a lot of time, money and resources to come see us play,\u201d Clark says. \u201cWhenever I step on the court, I just want to have a lot of fun and I\u2019ve been able to find a lot of joy and calmness in that. I don\u2019t get nervous for these games, honestly. It is what it is, it\u2019s basketball.\n\n\u201cOne game is not gonna make or break our season and I just find a calming presence in like, being around my teammates and having fun playing this game.\u201d\n\nIowa fans waiting outside before the arena opened its doors broke into \u201cLet\u2019s Go Hawks!\u201d chants that continued throughout the game, including while Maryland players were introduced.\n\nClark hit a step-back 3 from the left wing. But she traveled on the ensuing possession, which uplifted the Maryland fans. Then the Terrapins roared ahead 11-3, their players flying off the bench to greet Shyanne Sellers after her jumper before a timeout during the sequence.\n\nBy the end of the quarter, though, Clark had three more 3s, including two more step-backs and one of her \u201clogo 3s\u201d from deep on the left wing. The show was on.\n\n\u201cShootin\u2019-from-the-logo 3, that\u2019s not just luck,\u201d Dickson Jensen, Clark\u2019s former AAU coach for the All Iowa Attack, told USA TODAY Sports ahead of the game. \u201cI mean, she shoots hundreds of those, hundreds, every day, and has for 6-7 years. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re 6-6 or not. It doesn\u2019t matter when (she\u2019s) shooting from out here.\u201d\n\nIowa plays at a fast pace and always had an answer for Maryland\u2019s runs, whether it be a Clark buzzer-beating 3 to end the first quarter or driving layup to close the second.\n\n\u201cThat game felt like March,\u201d said Maryland coach Brenda Frese, whose team fell to 12-10 (4-7 Big Ten) while faced with one of the toughest strengths of schedule in the country.\n\nClark finished 7 of 17 from 3-point range. But something else happened, too, an aspect of her game that makes her especially deadly and Iowa look unbeatable at times. From the start of the game, she was whipping passes around \u2013 short, medium and long \u2013 and finding open teammates, even if they didn't convert on baskets.\n\nThey eventually did, and Clark finding teammates for backdoor cuts helped end a Maryland run that erased an 18-point deficit in the third quarter. After back and forth play, the score was tied 76-76 with 6:17 left in the fourth.\n\nAt that point, Clark hit another big 3 then found teammate Sydney Affolter underneath from the top of the key and later for a 3-pointer that helped seal the game.\n\n\u201cI thought we did a really good job of backdoor-cutting tonight and looking for scores around the rim,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe know Maryland plays out, they\u2019re in passing lanes, so look to go backdoor and people are ready to finish the ball.\u201d\n\nTwo other Iowa scorers (Molly Davis, 17; Kate Martin, 15) finished in double figures. Meanwhile, Clark\u2019s passes came with one and two hands, her drives from the right and left. She delivered for everyone who came out.\n\n\u201cAll last season, we had 10,000-plus at home, and then we go on the magical run (to the women\u2019s NCAA title game) that we go on and we\u2019re playing in front of sold-out crowds every single step of the way,\u201d Clark says. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s changed whether we are on the road or at home, there\u2019s always huge crowds, but I think our team has just become just used to it. I mean, that\u2019s the biggest thing, is like nobody shies away from these moments, whether you\u2019re coming off the bench or you\u2019re in the starting five, it\u2019s just what you\u2019re used to at this point and you don\u2019t have much say in it, so you better embrace it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd really, more than anything, it\u2019s really good for women\u2019s basketball so just enjoy every single moment.\u201d\n\nShe walked off the court to cheers and her arms raised in appreciation.\n\nBefore it began, one fan lining up, Erin Pryce of Baltimore, admitted she bought season tickets just to go to this game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bandwagon,\u201d she said.\n\nSo is much of America as Clark moves perhaps a couple games from the women\u2019s scoring record."}

These are not the solar panels you might have on your house but installations significant enough to replace power plants, each one powering tens of thousands of homes.\n\nThe limits come in the form of outright bans, moratoriums, construction impediments and other conditions that make green energy difficult to build.\n\nThe opposition to renewable energy isn't as simple as left vs. right. There\u2019s no one group fighting renewables. Instead, there are many, with a range of objections. But the overall result is rapidly increasing the limits on clean energy.\n\nSixty percent of the country's energy comes from fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. To get close to 100% carbon-free energy, which includes nuclear and hydroelectric power, utility-scale solar and wind electricity production must ramp up significantly.\n\nIs renewable energy on target to replace other sources by 2035?\n\nA big increase in renewable-energy construction is underway across the country. But the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s projection of trends shows the mix of energy sources still isn\u2019t on track to hit those goals.\n\nWhile 15% of U.S. counties may sound like a small portion of the country, the rate of those bans and impediments is increasing quickly.\n\nCounties blocking solar power are nearly equal to counties adding it\n\nUSA TODAY's analysis, backed by energy and academic experts, gauges which counties have effectively blocked or impeded new utility-scale wind and solar power. The findings reveal that 2023 was the first time the number of counties curtailing new solar installations was almost equal to the number of counties adding their first solar farm.\n\nCounties blocking wind power outnumber counties adding it\n\nFor wind energy, the blocks are even more significant. While 183 counties got their first commercial wind-power project in the past decade, nearly 375 counties blocked new wind development in the same period.\n\nIn 2009, 23 out of North Carolina\u2019s 100 counties banned new wind projects. In 2014, Kentucky made it effectively impossible to build new turbines in all 120 of its counties and Connecticut did likewise in its eight counties. In 2017 Vermont did the same in its 14 counties. In 2018 Tennessee essentially stopped new wind projects in all but four of its 95 counties.\n\nThese statewide blocks are in addition to many individual counties in the Great Plains, the Midwest and Texas \u2013 known as the wind belt \u2013 which have restricted wind turbines or created rules so power companies don\u2019t pursue certain locations.\n\nThe US has great wind and solar energy potential\n\nIn areas where the wind blows faster and more consistently, wind turbines can make more electricity. In areas where the sky is consistently more sunny, solar panels can make more electricity. Scientists measure this as \"energy generation capacity.\"\n\nBut outright bans or other limits on wind turbines, especially in the Midwest, could block some of the highest potential for power generation in the nation. Likewise, the Southwest and Southeast have tremendous solar potential, but local restrictions sometimes block new large-scale solar plants in areas with high energy generation capacity.\n\nBans and impediments in these high-potential areas spread quickly in recent years\n\nRestrictions on wind energy often, bans seem to spread to nearby counties. Even counties that have never had wind projects (but are near counties that have) are more likely to block new projects.\n\nCounties also restrict solar, in some cases to such a small area that it\u2019s unfeasible to build. More than half of these bans occurred in counties that already have some operational solar capacity.\n\nIn addition to outright bans on new wind and solar, many places have significant impediments that prevent construction, including zoning restrictions, land-use rules and political stonewalling.\n\nThere are several ways changes to zoning rules can block new energy plants. When it comes to wind, one common requirement involves the height of a turbine and its distance from adjacent property lines.\n\nZoning requirements impede wind power installations\n\nA \"setback\" requirement is the distance a turbine must be set back from an adjacent property that is not part of the wind project, or in some cases from an adjacent structure. Some states have created model, often voluntary, siting rules for wind and solar plants that establish reasonable setback distances as 1.1 or 1.5 times turbine height \u2013 that would be roughly 600 to 900 feet for a modern turbine.\n\nThese rules are intended to prevent rare instances of a turbine overhanging or falling onto another property. But more extreme setback requirements can create significant impediments to wind power, often acting as a de facto ban. USA TODAY\u2019s analysis considers a setback requirement greater than 1,000 feet to be a significant impediment to wind power.\n\nWinds are stronger at higher altitudes and longer turbine blades catch more air. Most new turbines in the U.S. are 500 feet or taller. Some counties require larger setbacks: 1,320 feet (a quarter-mile), 1,500 feet, a mile, or in some cases as much as 3 miles. Such requirements limit the land available for turbines so much that wind farms are no longer economically feasible.\n\nIn the abstract example below, options for utility-scale wind production decrease sharply as required setback distances increase.\n\nIn a hypothetical example prepared by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, we can see how wind power potential in Butler County, Nebraska, would look if operations were limited by structural setbacks \u2013 not just property line setbacks \u2013 of distances of 1,300 feet and 3,400 feet. A 3,400-foot setback would box out most available land possibilities for wind development.\n\nSome counties have restrictive sound limits for wind turbines\n\nAnother impediment involves noise limits. In the 2010s, common concerns about wind turbines included health impacts from a swishing noise made by the blades. While these fears have been discounted by research, decibel limits remain. For example, Vermont limited turbine sound levels to 45 decibels at night \u2013 somewhere between rustling leaves and a household dishwasher.\n\nExperts believe a relatively small amount of land is needed to meet all of America's future power needs\n\nDespite the recent rise in bans and impediments, the U.S. can still reach its goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. However, experts say the bans are a worrisome trend and will make achieving that goal more expensive as developers are forced to move projects to less windy and sunny areas.\n\nThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory calculated the U.S. would require just 10,424 square miles to accommodate the necessary wind and solar farms. The lower 48 states of the U.S. comprise about 2.9 million square miles.\n\nSome states are leading the way with wind and solar use\n\nWhile many counties seek ways to keep clean energy out of their backyards, some places in America are embracing wind and solar. Iowa, for example, gets over 65% of its electricity from wind and solar, but 11 counties there now block new wind farms. Illinois, meanwhile, prohibits counties from banning wind and solar.\n\nWind and solar are the most economical energy solutions\n\nToday, wind and solar are cheaper to produce than many other types of electricity. The unsubsidized cost of wind power has dropped 66% since 2009, while the cost of unsubsidized solar has fallen 84%, according to an annual analysis by Lazard, a financial advisory firm that publishes annual estimates of the total cost of producing electricity. This is the average levelized cost, which includes the cost to build, operate, fuel and maintain a power plant.\n\nSeveral national think tanks and groups \u2013 many of which receive fossil fuel funding \u2013 have been putting out arguments, often false, opposing wind and solar power for years.\n\nBut sometimes, the big utility companies making money on fossil fuels are the same ones seeking to build solar farms or wind turbines.\n\nAnd much of the opposition comes from local activists without obvious ties to national groups. Many are simply upset with what they see as a massive change in the places they love.

But his teammate Ty Gibbs controlled a large portion of the race until a late caution set up a restart with 10 laps remaining.\n\nHamlin got the lead on the restart and was about to win until Gibbs crashed on the last lap to send the race into overtime. Hamlin then got a jump on reigning NASCAR champion Ryan Blaney, who needed a provisional to make the 23-car field, on the restart for the win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a great momentum boost,\u201d said Hamlin, who will now move on to the season-opening Daytona 500, where he will seek a fourth win in \u201cThe Great American Race.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, I clean off all the trophies every January 1st in the entryway of the house and now we get to add another one pretty quick, so pretty happy about that.\u201d\n\nHamlin then turned to the crowd \u2013 many of the spectators were booing him \u2013 and repeated his standard taunt: \u201cYou know I beat your favorite driver again, right?\u201d\n\nHamlin has now won the Clash four times, but his other three wins came when the exhibition was held at Daytona International Speedway, including his rookie year.

She told the USA TODAY Network that she is campaigning to change an \u201cunsustainable status quo\u201d she believes is hurting the middle class and creating hopelessness for the American people.\n\nIn 1998, she founded Project Angel Food, a nonprofit that provides free meals to Los Angeles residents who are too sick to shop and cook for themselves.

Williamson has said she will ban all fracking operations in the U.S. and prioritize training workers to move from traditional energy sectors to new ones.\n\nCrime & policing\n\nThe author and spiritual leader has called America\u2019s longstanding efforts to fight crime ineffective. Instead, she proposes what she calls a holistic approach to address the underlying causes of crime.

She has also proposed launching a 10- to 20-year plan for \u201cturning a wartime economy into a peace-time economy,\u201d which would involve shifting current investments to building schools, infrastructure and more.\n\nHealth care\n\nWilliamson supports a Medicare for All-type health care system, a universal plan for Americans that would replace coverage from private health insurance companies. If elected president, she would push for lower prescription drug prices by pursuing negotiations with drug companies. But Williamson has also called for a \u201cWhole Health Plan,\u201d in which the country would prioritize health and wellness initiatives across the board.

But it was an important milestone nonetheless, setting Biden on course to win the nomination as he looks unite the entire party around his candidacy.\n\nBiden appeared to win at least 96% of the vote, with Rep. Dean Phillips, D.-Minn., and author Marianne Williamson finishing in the low single digits.\n\nHere are 3 key takeaways from the night.\n\nDespite Democratic angst, Biden is headed for the nomination\n\nBiden quashed any doubts whether he will be the Democratic nominee with his dominant win in South Carolina \u2212 despite facing repeated questions about his ability to rally the base.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nFor the past year, polls have shown that most Democratic voters would prefer someone other than Biden as their party's standard-bearer in 2024.\n\nBut Biden's overwhelming victory in South Carolina \u2212 the first state to vote in the new Democratic primary calendar \u2212 proved that the longshot candidacies of Phillips and Williamson are not serious threats.\n\nBiden, 81, still faces concerns within his party about his age and ability to fire up young voters, progressives and other core constituencies. Yet despite his flaws as a candidate, a viable Democratic challenger never mounted last year, and Biden is cruising toward the nomination.\n\nPam Joy, a Black 62-year-old waitress from Charleston, sat out of the Saturday's primary but said she plans to vote for Biden in November despite her concerns about his age because she usually votes for Democrats.\n\nWith the outcome in South Carolina never in doubt, Biden spent Saturday traveling to Los Angeles to attend a fundraiser for his campaign. He called into a South Carolina Democratic watch party to address supporters via speakerphone.\n\n\"The stakes in this election could not be higher,\" Biden said in a statement after his win, warning of \"extreme and dangerous voices at work in the country \u2212 led by Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign had already pivoted to a likely rematch against Trump after the former president's victory in the New Hampshire Republican Primary. Next up in the Democratic primary is Nevada, which votes Tuesday.\n\nWhile South Carolina gave Biden an opportunity to test his message with Black voters, who dominate the Democratic electorate in the state, Nevada offers a similar opportunity with Latino voters. Nevada, unlike heavily Republican South Carolina, is also a critical battleground state in the general election.\n\nA big night for Black voters\n\nSaturday's primary marked South Carolina Democrats' first since the Democratic National Committee upended its primary calendar to scrap Iowa and New Hampshire as the first and second states to vote to begin with the Palmetto State.\n\nThe party's rationale: Even though South Carolina isn't in play in the general election, its large Black population showcases Democrats' most reliable and important constituency, letting them set the course for the nomination process.\n\nVoter turnout Saturday, not surprisingly, decreased dramatically from the highly competitive, open Democratic primary of 2020, which Biden also won. Turnout among Democrats Saturday was only about 24% of the 2020 turnout.\n\nBut Michael Tyler, communications director for the Biden campaign, said Black voters made up approximately 76% of the early vote in South Carolina this year, compared to 56% in 2020.\n\nBetty Managault, 82, a retired nursing assistant who is Black, said she voted for Biden because he was \u201ca godly man.\u201d She said there was no doubt in her mind that Biden would win the primary but felt it was important for her to vote.\n\n\u201cMy ancestors, they died for me to get this right to vote,\u201d she said, as she sat at a table selling sweet grass baskets she\u2019d made.\n\nSouth Carolina \u2212 with a boost from the state's most prominent Democrat, Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C. \u2212 famously saved Biden's candidacy in 2020 after his initial losses in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\n\"Now in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again,\" Biden said in a statement after his win Saturday, \"and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the presidency again \u2212 and making Donald Trump a loser \u2212 again.\"\n\nAhead of the general election, Biden has work to do to ensure Black voters support him at the same level they did in 2020. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll last month found Biden has support of just 63% of Black voters, a sharp decline from the 87% he carried in 2020.\n\nIf Black support continues to lag, it could be devastating to Biden's chances in the fall.\n\nWhat's next for Biden's challengers?\n\nIt's quite clear now: Williamson, the self-help author, and Phillips, a congressman from Minnesota, pose no threat to Biden, raising questions about how long they plan to stay in the race.\n\nBiden has ignored both and not suffered any consequences as a result.\n\nTheir brutal performances in South Carolina came after Biden won the New Hampshire primary overwhelmingly last month even though his name did not appear on the ballot. Biden won as a write-in candidate after Phillips hinged his campaign on claiming a symbolic New Hampshire win in Biden's absence.\n\nBack-to-back blowout losses for Phillips, who upset many in the party when he launched a late primary challenge in October, beg the question whether it is time to bow out.\n\nPhillips, though, said he is pressing on even as it appeared he will finish third behind Williamson.\n\n\"Cracking four digits never felt so good!\" Phillips said on the social media site X, formerly Twitter. \"Congratulations, Mr. President, on a good old fashioned whooping. See you in Michigan.\""}

He had four points for the day, and his All-Star teammates Mathew Barzal (New York Islanders) and Alex DeBrincat (Detroit Red Wings) had six points each.\n\nTeam McDavid overcame a 3-1 deficit in the final minute to force a shootout in the first semifinal. Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid tied the game in the final seconds and he and the Boston Bruins' David Pastrnak scored in the shootout for a 4-3 win.\n\nThe second game was a back-and-forth affair with DeBrincat scoring twice in regulation and in the shootout for a 6-5 win. Frank Vatrano (Anaheim Ducks) and Filip Forsberg (Nashville Predators) each had two goals.\n\nThrow in an entertaining revamped skills competition, and the league accomplished its goal.\n\nHere are the winners and losers for the NHL All-Star Game weekend at Toronto's Scotiabank Arena:\n\nWINNERS\n\nConnor McDavid doubly good at the skills competition\n\nThe NHL consulted the Oilers star on how to make the event more interesting and the collaboration worked. The skills competition had become too gimmicky \u2014 witness the dunk tank in Florida and the game of 21 with oversized cards on the Las Vegas Strip. Even the breakaway contest with costumes had become stale. Friday was a return to the basics. Having only 12 participants and having players eliminated after the sixth and seventh events were good touches. The winner-take-all $1 million prize added to the stakes. And for good measure, McDavid won four events and got the check.\n\nPlayer draft made for interesting combinations in All-Star Game\n\nColorado Avalanche star Nathan MacKinnon chose buddy and fellow Nova Scotian Sidney Crosby for his team, and Crosby assisted on MacKinnon's two goals. They normally wouldn't have played together because they're in different divisions. Bruins teammates Pastrnak and Jeremy Swayman went against each other in the first game. The goalie robbed Pastrnak on a breakaway, but the forward beat his teammate with 31 seconds left and also in the shootout.\n\nThe NHL went five times from 1998 to 2014 and didn't go the last two times. The Olympics are better with the best players participating, especially with stars McDavid, the Tkachuk brothers and others finally getting a chance to go. The 2025 4 Nations Face-Off featuring the United States, Canada, Finland and Sweden sounds like a good appetizer and the idea of having an international tournament every other year will satisfy players' desire to suit up for their countries.\n\nGoaltenders put on a show\n\nThe All-Star weekend is supposed to be rough on goalies, but there were outstanding performances. Avalanche goalie Alexandar Georgiev got the $100,000 prize in the skills competition by making nine saves against McDavid in the one-on-one contest. He stopped nine of 10 shots in the first game for Team MacKinnon. Florida Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky (Team McDavid) had the save of the day, sliding over to rob Team Matthews' Mitch Marner in the final seconds of the first half of the championship game to keep the score at 3-3. Marner, whose Maple Leafs lost to Bobrovsky in the second round last season, playfully tossed his glove at the goalie.\n\nConnor Bedard makes a surprise appearance\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks rookie suffered a broken jaw the day after he was named to the All-Star Game. But he went to Toronto and took part in the skills competition as a passer in the one-timer contest. \"I feel good and I feel ready, so if it were up to me, I would\u2019ve been back,\" he told Sportsnet on Saturday. \"But of course, I've got to make sure it's healed and make sure you're not risking anything out there.\" He's still the NHL's top-scoring rookie, but it remains to be seen if he still is when he returns.\n\nProfessional Women's Hockey League's Savannah Harmon\n\nShe had a hat trick and five points as the upstart women's league got a showcase 3-on-3 game during All-Star Thursday. Unfortunately, the event was only shown on streaming services in the United States.\n\nLOSERS\n\nNikita Kucherov booed at the skills competition\n\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning forward was among the four players eliminated after six events on Friday. He finished last with half a point and fans booed his effort. He waved to fans after finishing last in the stickhandling with a time of 44.178, nearly six seconds slower than Boston's David Pastrnak, who missed the net and had to retrieve the puck. He did score in his first shift in the All-Star Game before being booed in his shootout attempt.\n\nMathew Barzal's bad luck in the final skills event\n\nThe speedy New York Islanders forward got off to a good start in the obstacle course in his bid for the grand prize. But when he got to the tiny nets, he kept missing and missing and missing. Only 1.5 points behind McDavid heading into the event, he finished last in the obstacle course and fifth overall. But he made up for it with a goal and five assists during Saturday's game.\n\nThursday's All-Star player draft\n\nEven with celebrity captains and the best players participating, it was kind of dull. The earlier versions in 2011, 2012 and 2015 were more interesting, maybe because there were plenty of liquid refreshments.\n\nPhil Kessel had to sweat it out as the last pick in 2011 but was rewarded with a car. Team captains in 2015 denied Alex Ovechkin his lobbying to be picked last so he could win a car (to give to a charity, it turns out). In this year's event, the final four unchosen players learned their teams by being handed an envelope. And there was no car.\n\nThe passing contest at the skills competition\n\nThe league might want to rethink this one. There were a lot of misses and probably for a good reason. In a game, when players pass, their teammates are moving. In this contest, the targets were stationary.\n\nHockey Canada scandal dominates Gary Bettman's news conference\n\nThe NHL addressed the Hockey Canada sexual assault scandal on Friday, three days before London (Ontario) Police are to hold a news conference about the case involving four NHL players and a former NHL player. They're accused of sexually assaulting a woman after a Hockey Canada gala honoring the gold-medal world junior team in 2018.\n\nCommissioner Gary Bettman said the \"alleged behavior\" was \"abhorrent,\" but he and deputy commissioner Bill Daly are lawyers and elected to be careful about what they said. They didn't reveal the findings of a 12-month independent investigation. Bettman put off any talk of the league's response about the allegations, noting the players are on leave from their teams and are free agents after the season.\n\n\"The most responsible and prudent thing for us to do is await the conclusion of the judicial proceedings, at which point, we will respond as appropriate at the time,\" he said."}

The White House said after the ruling that the razor wire makes it dangerous for federal border agents to do their jobs, including to give aid to migrants.\n\nEven after the high court ruling, Texas has barred U.S. Border Patrol from entering Shelby Park, a city-owned park near the Rio Grande where migrants had been entering by the thousands in recent years. The state continues to put up additional razor wire.\n\nMeanwhile, migrants have continued making the treacherous crossings, but the park itself has seen a drop in crossings since December. Last summer, USA TODAY reported that razor wire was causing serious injuries \u2013 sometimes to children \u2013 including bruises, broken ankles and deep gashes that needed medical staples to close.\n\nHere's what to know about the contentious fight over how to patrol the border, and the often tragic consequences.\n\nTexas governor defies feds' efforts at border\n\nThe Texas National Guard is installing razor wire along the southern border despite the ruling, as part of Gov. Greg Abbott's efforts to prevent migrants from entering the U.S.\n\n\"This is not over. Texas' razor wire is an effective deterrent to the illegal crossings Biden encourages,\" Abbott said on social media on the day of the Supreme Court's ruling Jan. 22.\n\nAbbott is backed by nearly all Republican state governors. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is the latest to send members of its National Guard to aid Texas. DeSantis said the state will soon send up to 1,000 members of its National Guard.\n\n\"The goal is to help Texas fortify this border, help them strengthen the barricades, help them add barriers, help them add the wire that they need to so that we can stop this invasion once and for all,\u201d DeSantis said Thursday. \u201cAnd the states have to band together.\u201d\n\nUNEASE IN EAGLE PASS:As battle brews between Texas and U.S., tiny border city braces for its next conflict\n\nWhat is the tension between US Border Patrol and Texas?\n\nThe standoff over control of the Texas-Mexico border has boiled down to the state, controlled by a Republican governor, vs. the federal government, with a Democrat in the White House. It's an unravelling of a long-held cooperation between the state's law enforcement and Border Patrol officials.\n\nImmigration enforcement is typically a federal responsibility.\n\nAbbott closed Shelby Park to the public in January in what city officials said was a surprise, putting it in the custody of the state.\n\nBorder Patrol had previously been using the park as an area to process migrants crossing the border via the Rio Grande. With the seizure, the park was closed off to federal agents as well, despite pleas from the federal government to enter.\n\nOn Friday, no migrants were seen at the park while Texas National Guard members installed additional razor wire.\n\n\"It is unconscionable for a public official, to deliberately refuse to communicate, coordinate, collaborate with other public officials in the service of our nation\u2019s interests, and to refuse to do so with the hope of creating disorder for others,\" U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told the Associated Press.\n\nClash raises legal, constitutional questions\n\nAfter Abbott seized control of the park, the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision voted to allow federal agents to remove the razor wire in a major victory for the Biden administration.\n\nIn court papers, the administration had argued the wire prevents Border Patrol agents from reaching migrants as they cross the river and that federal immigration law supersede Texas' own efforts to slow a flow of migrants into the country.\n\n\"Texas\u2019 political stunts, like placing razor wire near the border, simply make it harder and more dangerous for frontline personnel to do their jobs,\" said Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez, a spokesman for the White House.\n\n'INFLECTION POINT':Gov. Ron DeSantis sends Florida National, State Guard to Texas\n\nBut Abbott said after the ruling that the state has a right to secure its border, and criticized President Joe Biden for lax enforcement of immigration laws.\n\n\"I will continue to defend Texas' constitutional authority to secure the border and prevent the Biden Admin from destroying our property,\" Abbott said.\n\nThe next moves for the courts or the U.S. Department of Justice are uncertain, but meanwhile, Biden has vowed to take immediate action to \"shut down\" the border with Mexico if Congress approves a proposal under negotiation in the Senate, and urged lawmakers to pass a bipartisan bill \"if they're serious about the border crisis.\"\n\nStandoff draws attention to the human toll of border policies\n\nA Mexican woman and her two children died trying to cross the Rio Grande last month near Shelby Park. Mexican officials alerted U.S. Border Patrol that the three migrants drowned earlier, but two other migrants, another mother and son, were in distress on the U.S. side of the river. Border Patrol agents requested access to the area to find the two, but were denied. Texas officials said personnel didn\u2019t see the two in distress, and Mexican officials ended up rescuing the mother and son, who had symptoms of hypothermia.\n\nThe three deaths, and scores of documented injuries while crossing through razor wire, draw attention to the human toll faced by migrants as they continue across the border. In July, USA TODAY spoke with a family whose 5-year-old was snagged by razor wife, causing a 2-inch gash in his calf that had to be stapled shut. The family was processed and released by Border Patrol agents to await a court date.\n\nAlicia Garcia, a resident of Eagle Pass who told the Associated Press she usually avoids Shelby Park, questioned the value of Abbott's deterrence efforts \u2013 which include not only razor wire, but a floating buoy barrier \u2013 because many asylum-seekers are released by U.S. authorities until court.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the show?\u201d Garcia said. \"Better to just break everything down if they are still crossing.\u201d\n\nContributing: Eduardo Cuevas, Joey Garrison, Julia Gomez and Rick Jervis, USA TODAY; The Associated Press"}

The bill will be considered on the House floor next week and omits continued U.S. assistance to Ukraine, a top priority for the Biden administration that has seen falling support among the Republican ranks.\n\n\u201cThe need to support our closest ally and our own forces in the region has never been more pressing, and many members of our conference have urged immediate action,\u201d Johnson said in a letter to GOP members.\n\nShould the bill pass the House, it will put significant pressure on the Democratic-controlled Senate and President Joe Biden to approve aid for Israel which has widespread bipartisan support. House Republicans have balked at a bipartisan border deal from the Senate that seeks to tie both Ukraine and Israel aid to changes in migrant policy \u2013 Johnson's announcement further endangers any hopes of passing the Senate's deal.\n\nThe GOP-controlled House passed an Israel aid bill last year that provided over $14 billion in assistance to the country after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack. The bill paid for the funding by clawing back money from the Internal Revenue Service that originally came from the Inflation Reduction Act, milestone legislation championed by Biden and Democrats. The bill passed mostly along party lines, with a handful of Democrats supporting the measure begrudgingly.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHad the bill contained no provisions to pay for the aid, it would have likely garnered significant bipartisan support in the House and could have forced the Senate to pass it.\n\nBut the offset left the aid bill unpalatable for Senate Democrats who dismissed it as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that ultimately stalled assistance to the key U.S. ally. The move even garnered some criticism from some House Republicans who argued a clean bill \u2013 without any spending cuts \u2013 should have been passed in the first place. Since then, Congress has yet to pass any legislation aiding Israel.\n\n\u201cGiven the Senate\u2019s failure to move appropriate legislation in a timely fashion, and the perilous circumstances currently facing Israel, the House will continue to lead. Next week, we will take up and pass a clean, standalone Israel supplemental package,\" Johnson said in the letter.\n\nSenate reaction to a clean Israel funding bill is uncertain as the bipartisan deal to tie aid to Israel and other U.S. allies to border and migrant policy changes is set to be unveiled sometime this weekend.\n\nThose talks, which began four months ago between a small group of bipartisan senators, have been a frequent point of criticism from House Republicans who have scrutinized the deal over leaks about its migrant policy changes, saying its apparent measures would not go far enough to address the crisis at the southern border.\n\n\"While the Senate appears poised to finally release text of their supplemental package after months of behind closed doors negotiations, their leadership is aware that by failing to include the House in their negotiations, they have eliminated the ability for swift consideration of any legislation,\" Johnson said of the border talks in the letter."}

When I was 16, one of my cousins, \u201cWill,\u201d (a 30-year-old man who is now a doctor) invited me to New York City for a visit. I barely knew this side of the family, and I thought it would be great to go to New York. While I was visiting, Will raped me in his sister \u201cClare\u2019s\u201d apartment. I had no idea where I was and was terrified.\n\nThe next morning Clare walked into her apartment and freaked out on him. Although she asked if I was okay, she and her other brother did nothing to hold Will accountable for what he did. They even went so far as to blame me. I never told anyone what happened out of shame and fear. It really traumatized me, on many levels. There was no contact between our two families, except between my mother and aunt (Will\u2019s mother).\n\nFast-forward to a few years ago. Two of my brothers and my sister have rekindled a relationship with Clare, who has a big fancy house in Florida where they go to visit. This made me very uncomfortable. After my mother and aunt died, I told my siblings what happened and asked them to please not associate with that family. They said it happened long ago; it\u2019s my problem, and they see no reason to stop seeing Clare. I wonder if they don\u2019t believe me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter six years of wrestling with this, and some pretty angry emails from me, they refuse to even speak to me. Thank God I have a third brother who has helped me to get through the heartache. I have now cut off contact with my other siblings. But are my other siblings right?

Your focus is entirely on his siblings \u2014 and yours. Will, a 30-year-old man, raped his teenage cousin. You should wonder if his career as a predator stopped there.

The Associated Press called the race shortly after polls closed Saturday night. Biden entered the day as a massive favorite over two long-shot rivals, Rep. Dean Phillips (Minn.) and self-help author Marianne Williamson, in a state that was key to turning around his campaign four years ago. He is heavily favored to win renomination, even as he battles low approval ratings and concerns percolating in his party about how he would do in a general election.\n\nThe incumbent\u2019s team hoped a big win would springboard his campaign in the states ahead with a show of strength and quash intraparty doubts about some polling that has shown him trailing former president Donald Trump in a potential rematch. Saturday\u2019s vote was also expected to provide a measure of Biden\u2019s standing among Black voters, who helped propel Biden to victory and made up 56 percent of Democratic primary participants in the state four years ago, according to exit polls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith about 75 percent of the vote tallied, Biden held a commanding advantage, garnering more than 96 percent of the vote, according to the AP. Phillips and Williamson were each at about 2 percent.\n\nOn Saturday night, Biden\u2019s allies cheered his success at a watch party in Columbia, where Rep. James E. Clyburn (S.C.) praised the Democratic audience\u2019s \u201ctremendous\u201d effort and put the president on speakerphone with the cheering crowd.\n\nBiden later released a statement declaring \u201cthe people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the Presidency again \u2014 and making Donald Trump a loser \u2014 again.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, South Carolina was at the top of the Democratic nominating calendar, moving ahead of two states with considerably less racial diversity. The state was pivotal to Biden\u2019s 2020 nomination, and leapfrogged Iowa and New Hampshire at the behest of the president and his allies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeeking to counter a decline in approval for the president among some Black voters, the Biden campaign has underscored actions the administration has taken to help benefit Black communities. But some concerns about struggles to overhaul policing laws and protect voting rights remain a hurdle, operatives say.\n\nThe state Democratic Party announced earlier Saturday that 51,710 people voted early or absentee \u2014 a 33 percent decrease from 2020, which was a more competitive primary. Black voters made up a larger share of the early and absentee vote compared with 2020, increasing by 13 percent, according to the state party.\n\nVoters can choose to participate in either party\u2019s primary in South Carolina, with the Republican contest scheduled for Feb. 24. Some Democratic voters have said they are considering casting a ballot for Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, who is far behind Trump in the GOP contest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGibbs Knotts, a College of Charleston political scientist, said the turnout appeared to be lower due to the lack of competitiveness in the race. That could be helpful in the Republican primary later this month to Haley, who could draw on the voters who lean left but didn\u2019t participate in the Democratic primary, as she mounts an uphill challenge against the clear front-runner Trump, Knotts said. In advance of the Democratic primary, some voters received texts encouraging them to wait for the Republican primary and vote for Haley.\n\n\u201cIf the turnout is low here, it probably gives the Haley camp a little bit of hope,\u201d said Knotts.\n\nIn recent weeks, Biden, first lady Jill Biden and Vice President Harris campaigned in the state and made the case the administration has prioritized affordability, such as cutting the price of insulin; driven Black unemployment rates down to the lowest level in history; and contrasted sharply with a Trump presidency that they have argued would threaten Social Security and health care through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden told the audience at South Carolina\u2019s First in the Nation Dinner last Saturday that voters in the state are well positioned as the first state to award Democratic delegates to \u201cfinish what we started.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is I wouldn\u2019t be here without the Democratic voters of South Carolina, and that\u2019s a fact,\u201d he said to applause from the mostly Black audience. \u201cSo, I want to start with a very simple message: From the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you.\u201d\n\nSee more voting scenes in South Carolina + 3\n\nPhillips and Williamson have challenged the incumbent, in part arguing that they would be better positioned compared with Biden to take on Trump, but the rivals have yet to make a dent in Biden\u2019s firm Democratic support. Phillips acknowledged his long-shot odds ahead of Saturday\u2019s vote and said he plans to focus his efforts in Michigan, the next state in which he\u2019s on the primary ballot, where Arab and college-aged communities have expressed some concerns about Biden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe third-term congressman joked on X, formerly Twitter, about his significant defeat once 1,000 votes had been counted for him.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cCracking four digits never felt so good!\u201d he wrote Saturday night. \u201cCongratulations, Mr. President, on a good old fashioned whooping. See you in Michigan.\u201d\n\nBut Phillips also attacked Biden on turnout, arguing \u201cvoters are disappointed that they lack options beyond the choice between a threat to the fabric of the nation and a good man who voters want to pass the baton.\u201d\n\nPhillips and Williamson were not expected to find a large share of Democrats looking for an alternative in a state where Biden has the backing of longtime Democratic leaders, including Clyburn and Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison.\n\nPhillips spent the past week traveling to California and Texas to fundraise and in Washington for official duties, according to senior campaign adviser Jeff Weaver, who called South Carolina \u201cBiden country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanielle Vinson, a political science professor at Furman University, said Phillips's scant support indicates there is little interest in a Biden alternative in the state.\n\n\u201cWhile some folks might not be excited about Biden, they also aren\u2019t so worried about him that they are seriously looking for alternatives,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocrats close to Biden pointed to the president\u2019s win in New Hampshire\u2019s unsanctioned primary on Jan. 23, where he got about 64 percent of the vote despite not being on a ballot or campaigning in the state, far ahead of Phillips, who spent months in the Granite State and received less than 20 percent. (The DNC has said it will not seat New Hampshire delegates at the convention because the state ignored the party\u2019s new nominating schedule that put South Carolina first.)\n\nOn Saturday, Biden traveled to Los Angeles for a campaign event with Black entertainment executives, while Phillips was slated to be in Washington and New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome voters told The Post that they ultimately felt like Biden provides the best chance to defeat Trump, pointing to how Biden won in 2020.\n\nWhen Rose Marie Holman, a 76-year-old Charleston voter, listened to Phillips speak at a Democratic event in November, she nodded along as he discussed the need for new faces in their party. But Holman ultimately cast an early ballot for Biden because she thinks he has the best chance of protecting democracy, a top concern of hers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stick where I feel comfortable right now,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Rev. Thaddeus Smith, who voted for Biden, said he\u2019s heard from other young people that they want to see Biden do more to extend student loan relief, lower housing costs, encourage a cease-fire in Gaza and legalize marijuana. But Smith has told them that neither Trump nor Haley would be any better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m encouraging people to go out and vote for the Biden administration,\u201d Smith said, \u201cbecause does the alternative outweigh him not being elected to a second term?\u201d"}

The stunners. The cheers. The home runs, hat tricks and gameday magic. Don\u2019t miss out with The Sports Moment, a newsletter for the biggest sports news. ArrowRight Kingsbury, currently a senior offensive analyst at Southern California, appeared close to landing the offensive coordinator job for the Las Vegas Raiders before withdrawing his name from consideration, according to reports.\n\nEric Bieniemy, the Commanders\u2019 assistant head coach and offensive coordinator, has one year left on his contract.\n\nKingsbury, 44, previously was a middling head coach for the Arizona Cardinals and Texas Tech but has a strong track record of developing quarterbacks. By points scored, his Cardinals offenses finished 16th, 11th and 10th before falling to 23rd the year quarterback Kyler Murray tore his ACL; Washington\u2019s best finish since 2018 is 23rd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn college, Kingsbury tutored Texas Tech\u2019s Patrick Mahomes, Texas A&M\u2019s Johnny Manziel and Houston\u2019s Case Keenum. In the NFL, he coached Murray.\n\nIn April, after being fired by Arizona with a record of 28-37-1, Kingsbury joined USC to help mentor Caleb Williams, projected to be a top pick in this year\u2019s NFL draft. If Washington hires Kingsbury, it will fuel speculation the Commanders could trade up with the Chicago Bears to select the D.C. native.\n\nKingsbury runs a spread offense derived from the Air Raid, a pass-heavy scheme based out of the shotgun. But he calls runs at a higher rate than Bieniemy did last season.\n\nA former quarterback at Texas Tech, Kingsbury excelled in the Air Raid from 1998 to 2002. The New England Patriots drafted him in the sixth round in 2003, and he became a journeyman backup in the NFL and the Canadian Football League until he retired in 2007. The next year, he joined Houston as an offensive quality control coach and began ascending the coaching ladder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the defensive side, the Commanders are strongly considering Joe Whitt Jr., the Cowboys\u2019 secondary coach and pass game coordinator, two people familiar with the situation said. Whitt held the same title in Atlanta in 2020, when Dan Quinn was the Falcons\u2019 head coach, then followed Quinn to Dallas the next season.\n\nThe Commanders, who formally announced Quinn\u2019s hire as their head coach Saturday, are still working through the interview process for coordinators. Per NFL rules, teams must interview at least two external candidates for who are persons of color or women before hiring a coordinator.\n\nHere are some candidates, and other names worth watching as Washington rounds out its coaching staff.\n\nOffensive coordinator\n\nKliff Kingsbury, USC senior offensive assistant\n\nMahomes\u2019s former college coach went 28-37-1 in his first foray as an NFL head coach but may get a shot as a coordinator in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian Griese, San Francisco 49ers quarterbacks coach\n\nGriese, a quarterback who played 11 seasons in the NFL, jumped from the \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d booth to the sideline without any coaching experience in 2022. In two years, Griese, 48, has helped Brock Purdy, the last pick of the 2022 draft, develop into the league\u2019s leader in passer rating and is headed to Super Bowl LVIII. He is on the Commanders\u2019 list of candidates, a person with knowledge of the matter said. But if the team wants him, it will have to wait until after the Super Bowl to interview and hire him.\n\nBrian Johnson, former Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator\n\nA former Utah quarterback, Johnson, 36, spent the past three seasons with the Eagles \u2014 two as the team\u2019s quarterbacks coach and one as its offensive coordinator. He was let go in January after the Eagles lost to the Buccaneers in the first round of the playoffs. Johnson reportedly is expected to interview for the Commanders\u2019 OC job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChip Kelly, UCLA head coach\n\nThe longtime coach and play caller has been speculated for years to want to get back into the NFL after four seasons coaching the Eagles (2013-15) and 49ers (2016).

After a stint coaching the Cleveland Browns\u2019 linebackers (2014-15), Fleury spent three years (2016-18) with the Miami Dolphins as a football research analyst. He left in 2019 \u2014 just as Eugene Shen, the Commanders\u2019 vice president of football strategy, began his time in Miami \u2014 to join the 49ers and work his way up to tight ends coach in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers names to watch:\n\nTanner Engstrand, Detroit Lions passing game coordinator\n\nDarrell Bevell, Miami Dolphins quarterbacks coach/passing game coordinator\n\nTee Martin, Baltimore Ravens quarterbacks coach\n\nRonald Curry, New Orleans Saints passing game coordinator/quarterbacks coach\n\nJoe Bleymaier, Kansas City Chiefs passing game coordinator\n\nEric Studesville, Miami Dolphins associate head coach/running backs coach\n\nDefensive coordinator\n\nJoe Whitt Jr., Dallas Cowboys secondary coach/passing game coordinator\n\nA former walk-on receiver at Auburn, Whitt turned to coaching in 2000 and joined the pro ranks as a defensive backs coach for the Falcons in 2007. After 11 seasons as a defensive assistant for the Packers, with whom he won Super Bowl XLV, Whitt, 45, spent time with the Browns and Falcons before following Quinn to Dallas as the Cowboys\u2019 secondary coach and pass game coordinator in 2021.

If approved by the House by midweek, the bill would be the second one sent to the Senate in two months. But unlike the previous iteration, it includes $3.3 billion more for Israel and does not include controversial offsets to the Internal Revenue Service that House Republicans championed and were considered a non-starter by the Democratic Senate.\n\n\u201cThe Senate will no longer have excuses, however misguided, against swift passage of this critical support for our ally,\u201d Johnson wrote in his letter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe move comes as the Senate is expected to unveil and vote on a supplemental package this weekend that would fund new measures to control the historic flow of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, while fulfilling President Biden\u2019s $106 billion request to also aid Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region. House Republicans\u2019 surprise announcement to send the Senate a stand-alone Israel funding bill sets up dueling votes in both chambers, which remain apart on how to fund border security and Ukraine in divided government.\n\nNotably absent from the proposal is any funding for Ukraine, which has faced significant dwindling of support by the House GOP majority. The measure also does not include a border security proposal as House Republicans have insisted the Senate take up their bill passed last year.\n\nA group of bipartisan Senate negotiators has been working for months to find a compromise on border security after House Republicans telegraphed that they would not support Biden\u2019s request for a supplemental package that helps foreign allies unless it included significant changes to the border. Negotiations often ebbed and flowed with Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) working to overcome partisan hurdles in how to address changes to the U.S. asylum and parole system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding urgency to the issue, Biden vowed last month to use emergency authorities to \u201cshut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed\u201d if Congress passes the bipartisan immigration plan, largely putting the onus on the House GOP majority to accept the Senate deal.\n\nJohnson told his colleagues on Saturday that in the two months it took for senators to reach an agreement \u2014 which has yet to be unveiled \u2014 the world has witnessed an attack on U.S. forces, retaliatory strikes against Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, as well as the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas as justification to prioritize sending foreign aid to the region immediately, leaving open whether to consider a supplemental package later.\n\n\u201cWhile the Senate appears poised to finally release text of their supplemental package after months of behind closed doors negotiations, their leadership is aware that by failing to include the House in their negotiations, they have eliminated the ability for swift consideration of any legislation,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cGiven the Senate\u2019s failure to move appropriate legislation in a timely fashion, and the perilous circumstances currently facing Israel, the House will continue to lead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe House bill would provide $9.7 billion to replenish various missile and defense systems in Israel. It would allow the country to quickly obtain advanced weapons systems and other defense services through the Foreign Military Financing Program and would enhance the production of artillery munitions.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAnother $7.7 billion would be allotted to replenish U.S. defense stocks sent to Israel and military operations in the region in response to the Oct. 7 attack. Another $200 million would be used to protect U.S. personnel and aid in evacuations of U.S. citizens if necessary.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump has also been directing Republicans to vote against any border security measure until after the 2024 presidential election, fomenting even stronger support against any Senate proposal. Johnson has signaled his opposition to a Senate bill containing less than the measures proposed by House Republicans\u2019 border security bill, known as H.R. 2, but has not said whether he would put that proposal on the floor given that the text has yet to be released by Senate negotiators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House called the proposal a \u201ccynical political maneuver.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe strongly oppose this ploy which does nothing to secure the border, does nothing to help the people of Ukraine defend themselves against Putin\u2019s aggression, and denies humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Saturday night.\n\nBy forcing the Senate to take up the bill without offsets, Johnson has put the onus on Democrats, including in the House, to vote against a measure many wishing to help Israel would probably support. It also puts House Republicans in a stronger position to telegraph their own messaging before senators blame them for inaction.\n\nComplicating matters for Johnson, however, is how the far-right flank of his conference will react. They celebrated Johnson\u2019s inaugural bill that sent aid to Israel and included cuts to the IRS, which Republicans have long called for. But the House Freedom Caucus has remained opposed to passing funding bills that do not include cuts and Johnson\u2019s latest maneuver of relying on Democrats to send bills to the Senate given Republicans\u2019 narrow three-seat majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) threatened using a motion that led the way for former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to be ousted as speaker if Johnson brings a bill aiding Ukraine to the House floor, while Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) has floated triggering the measure if Johnson brings up a bad border security legislation for a vote.\n\nJohnson has repeatedly said that he is \u201cnot worried\u201d by the motion-to-vacate threats and that they do not guide his judgment on governing."}

Now, the ruthless drug \u201cqueenpin\u201d has gained new notoriety through \u201cGriselda,\u201d a six-episode Netflix series that chronicles Blanco\u2019s rise \u2014 and eventual downfall \u2014 as a cutthroat power player in a trade dominated by men, greed and violence.\n\nThe series, produced by the team behind \u201cNarcos,\u201d stars Sof\u00eda Vergara as the woman who came to epitomize Miami\u2019s \u201ccocaine cowboy\u201d violence of the 1970s and \u201980s \u2014 a time when the palm-fringed city became the homicide epicenter of the United States. The pulp semi-fiction compresses three years of Blanco\u2019s exploits into an anti-hero-esque arc and transforms Vergara into Blanco through the heavy use of plastic prostheses and glitzy wardrobes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAuthenticity is everything to us,\u201d series creator Eric Newman told Tudum, the official Netflix site. \u201c \u2026 There\u2019s no interview you\u2019re going to get with Griselda Blanco that tells you what she was thinking and feeling. And so creating that in the most authentic way becomes essential.\u201d\n\nThough much of the series follows reality, creative licenses were taken \u2014 some of which make Vergara\u2019s character appear slightly less brutal than the real-life Griselda. Here\u2019s how the series stacks up to the historical record.\n\n(If you haven\u2019t watched \u201cGriselda,\u201d be warned: There are spoilers ahead.)\n\nWho was Griselda Blanco and why was she nicknamed the \u2018Black Widow\u2019?\n\nBefore becoming one of the central figures in Miami\u2019s drug wars, Blanco \u2014 born Feb. 15, 1943 \u2014 was raised in the slums of Medell\u00edn during one of the most brutal periods of Colombia\u2019s history: a 10-year civil war known as \u201cLa Violencia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout her life, Blanco amassed a billion-dollar empire and was alleged to have been involved in the deaths of more than 200 people, including multiple ex-husbands, the Miami Herald reported \u2014 prompting one of her nicknames. She also gained notoriety for popularizing drive-by motorcycle murders in Colombian gang disputes and for using undergarments with secret compartments to smuggle cocaine.\n\nThe series and reality begin to diverge when \u201cGriselda\u201d depicts Blanco fleeing to Miami after killing Alberto Bravo, her second husband. In real life, Blanco had already been working in the United States for years before Bravo\u2019s death.\n\nIn the late \u201960s, the couple set up a network of cocaine couriers who were outfitted with Blanco\u2019s special smuggling bras and traveled between Colombia and New York. By 1975, the couple was on U.S. law enforcement\u2019s radar. After New York officials filed charges against them that year, Blanco and Bravo fled back to Colombia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Blanco continued making frequent trips to the United States, using disguises and fake passports. Bob Palombo, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who eventually arrested her, even called her \u201ca master of disguise.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe could change her appearance like a chameleon \u2014 gain 20 pounds, lose 30 pounds, change the color of her hair,\u201d he told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in 1989.\n\nIt\u2019d be years before authorities tracked her to another state.\n\nBlanco, who settled in Miami in 1978, was also known for her lavish lifestyle, her penchant for mob movies \u2014 \u201cThe Godfather\u201d inspired her son\u2019s name, Michael Corleone \u2014 and for having a dog named Hitler.\n\nDid killings depicted in the series actually happen?\n\nYes, and they were just as gruesome.\n\nThe series features Blanco orchestrating what\u2019s known as the Dadeland Mall Massacre of 1979, during which her henchmen shot her rival so many times that the man and his companion looked \u201clike Swiss cheese,\u201d a medical examiner said at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was also eventually charged in the killing of the 2-year-old son of Jes\u00fas \u201cChucho\u201d Castro, one of her organization\u2019s enforcers who had a falling out with Blanco\u2019s son. The Miami police chief at the time said Blanco was not present when the boy was killed, \u201cbut she gave the orders and paid the hit men,\u201d the Tampa Bay Times reported.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIn the series, Vergara\u2019s Blanco is at first remorseful and skittish at the idea of murder \u2014 only turning to violence to convince the male kingpins that she was not to be messed with.

Blanco then calls the authorities on herself after learning Salazar is on the West Coast, in an effort to stave off his revenge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s not what really happened. By 1984, officials had tracked Blanco to California, where she moved after creating too many enemies in Miami. After surveilling her for months, federal agents busted into her Irvine, Calif., home while she was reading the Bible, the Sun Sentinel reported. In 1985, she was sentenced to 15 years in prison for conspiracy to import cocaine.\n\nHowever, Blanco allegedly continued conducting drug trades from behind bars through her boyfriend, a dealer who\u2019d sent her a fan letter in 1991. Then in 1994, prosecutors, who\u2019d enlisted Ayala as their star witness, charged her with three counts of murder and were seeking the death penalty.\n\nBut like the series shows, the murder case fell apart after Miami-Dade County state attorney\u2019s office employees were caught having inappropriate relationships with Ayala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlanco reached a deal with federal authorities after the scandal. She pleaded guilty to the three murder charges and was sentenced to serve three concurrent 20-year sentences. Before serving the full sentences, she was deported to Colombia in 2004, where she lived in an exclusive gated community, according to Vice.\n\nEight years later, Blanco was at a butcher shop in Medell\u00edn when a man pulled up on a motorcycle and shot her twice, killing her using the same technique she was said to have popularized. She was 69.\n\nWhat happened to her family?\n\nBlanco\u2019s three oldest sons \u2014 Dixon, Uber and Osvaldo Trujillo-Blanco \u2014 who were shown to have been murdered on the show suffered the same fate in real life, \u201cpurportedly in retribution for carnage she herself caused,\u201d Miami New Times reported.\n\nBlanco\u2019s youngest, Michael Corleone Blanco, is still alive, but he\u2019s not happy with \u201cGriselda.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, he slammed the series as \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d He and his wife are now suing Vergara and Netflix for the \u201cunauthorized\u201d use of the family\u2019s likeness, claiming in a lawsuit that the streaming giant used information from private interviews without authorization."}

The 19-year-old college student\u2019s infamous abduction in Berkeley, California, led to Hearst joining forces with her captors for a 1974 bank robbery that earned her a prison sentence.\n\nHearst, granddaughter of wealthy newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, will turn 70 on Feb. 20. She is now known as Patricia Hearst Shaw after she married a police officer who guarded her when she was out on bail, the late Bernard Shaw. She has been in the news in recent years for her dogs, mostly French bulldogs, that have won prizes in the Westminster Kennel Club dog show.\n\nHearst\u2019s allegiance to the Symbionese Liberation Army raised questions about Stockholm syndrome, a common term deployed to describe the bond that victims of kidnappings or hostage situations sometimes develop with their captors.\n\nStockholm syndrome got its name from an August 1973 failed bank robbery in Sweden\u2019s capital. Rather than a diagnosis of a disorder, experts describe it as a psychological coping mechanism used by some hostages to endure being held captive and abused.\n\nHearst, who went by the name \u201cTania\u201d in the group, denounced her family and posed for a photograph carrying a weapon in front of their flag. The self-styled radicals viewed aspects of U.S. society as racist and oppressive, and they were accused of killing a California school superintendent.\n\nAs a member of a wealthy and powerful family, Hearst was kidnapped to bring attention to the Symbionese Liberation Army, according to the FBI. The group demanded food and money donations for the poor in exchange for Hearst\u2019s release, though she remained a captive even after her family met the ransom through a $2 million food distribution program.\n\nHearst took part in the group\u2019s robbery of a San Francisco bank on April 15, 1974. Surveillance cameras captured her wielding an assault rifle during the crime.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t arrested until the FBI caught up with her on Sept. 18, 1975, in San Francisco, 19 months after her abduction.\n\nHer trial was one of the most sensational of that decade.

The bejeweled bride and her natty groom are beaming.\n\nOutside, the street is jammed with cars heading to wedding parties in neighboring banquet halls, L\u2019Amour, Candles and Hill Top. Hill Top, a multiplex, has three weddings going on at once.\n\nIt\u2019s winter in Pakistan, and that means weddings. Lots of weddings. During the cooler weather between November and February, millions of people attend weddings every week. Pakistani diaspora come home from around the world for the season, packing airport arrival halls and five-star hotels.\n\nPeople call it Decemberistan.\n\n\u201cDecember is when everybody has an excuse to put a pause on worrying, whatever income level you are,\u201d said Karachi-based communications consultant Khizra Munir. \u201cEveryone\u2019s on the same page that we\u2019re going to live in the moment. It\u2019s a great time to have a reunion, a great excuse to dress up.\u201d\n\nWeddings are one of the few opportunities for people in the conservative Muslim country to socialize and party. So it\u2019s no surprise that people draw them out a bit.\n\nA typical Pakistani wedding means at least three events, and often more: there\u2019s the engagement, the gathering when friends and family apply turmeric paste to the bride\u2019s hands and face in a pre-glam ritual, another party for applying henna to the bride\u2019s hands and feet \u2014 which, of course, means more music and dancing. The bride gets a procession. So does the groom.\n\nIn Karachi\u2019s Cantonment area, Yamima Teresa Bhagtaney and Sharoon Arjumand John tied the knot at Holy Trinity Cathedral.\n\nGuests thumbed through the order of service, which one Muslim guest in the pews said was \u201cvery helpful\u201d for navigating the Christian ceremony.\n\nThe wedding had the hallmarks of a traditional Christian wedding \u2014 a white dress, hymns, choristers, an organist, the exchange of vows and rings \u2014 and a traditional Pakistani one, with multiple photographers and videographers capturing every detail.\n\nThey even accompanied the bride up the aisle, but stopped short when the couple and their families received Holy Communion.\n\nThe groom\u2019s father, Bishop of Karachi the Right Rev. Frederick John, said Christian weddings were celebrated the same way as any other wedding in Pakistan, including the mehndi \u2013 when the bride receives henna on her hands and feet \u2013 and a dholki, when guests gather at a family member\u2019s house to sing and dance.\n\nPakistani weddings only seem to be getting more elaborate.\n\nMunir said she went to 10 events for the wedding of one family friend this season, wearing a different outfit each time. She said weddings have become so big and \u201cover the top\u201d that it\u2019s sometimes hard to build an emotional connection. \u201cIt\u2019s all about outfits, what you\u2019re wearing, who you\u2019re wearing, have you posted a picture of your outfit.\u201d The latest trend is guests hiring a choreographer to help them perfect a dance performance.\n\nThen there\u2019s the cost of all those parties. A wedding event in a banquet hall like Radiance can cost upwards of 1 million rupees ($3,576), a hefty price tag in a country whose annual GDP per capita is just over $1,500 and inflation is running high. A wealthier family could easily spend 10 to 20 million on one party.\n\nBanks offer loans and other wedding financing of up to 3 million rupees. Welfare institutions, including a Pakistani government one, support people from disadvantaged backgrounds or low-income households to pay for weddings.\n\nBut people still look forward to the wedding season, in spite of its demands on the wallet and wardrobe. \u201cWorrying about how all of this is going to be managed and the financial burden of it, that\u2019s all year,\u201d said Munir. \u201cDecemberistan is the opposite of stressing about the finances.\u201d\n\nThe bride at Radiance is called Dua \u2014 \u201clike Dua Lipa,\u201d said her husband Asher \u2014 and she went to three other weddings this season. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really hard because I was prepared for everything,\u201d said Dua. \u201cI love the wedding season. It\u2019s about people getting together to celebrate.\u201d\n\nFizza Bangash expected to attend 10 to 12 events during the season. \u201cIn Islamabad, there are areas where you have lots of marriage halls in one place, so you can jump from one event to another quite easily.\u201d\n\nBangash got married on Dec. 25 at The Pavilion, Islamabad\u2019s oldest wedding hall, with 350 guests including people from Germany, Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. If she had her way, it would have been closer to 100.\n\nBut good manners requires inviting extended family, work colleagues of the couple and their parents and neighbors. Host families also need to consider whose weddings they have been invited to and reciprocate accordingly to avoid a social faux pas.\n\nBangash has fond memories of the homespun weddings she went to as a child. People set up a tent on the ground outside their home and invited close family and friends.\n\n\u201cNow there are so many expectations about the food, decor, sound system and marquee,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are a dozen venues around The Pavilion, boxy on the outside and blingy on the inside, and several more are under construction.\n\nAt Pacific Mansion, bookings are smaller than last year because of inflation and competition from the new venues, while the newest arrival \u2013 Zircon \u2013 is still accepting relatively tiny 100-person bookings to drum up custom.\n\nThe Manor hosted 35 events in December, and 28 in January. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been open seven or eight months and this is our first season. It\u2019s gone better than we could have dreamt of,\u201d said the hall\u2019s general manager, Syed Hassan Mahdi.\n\n\u201cThe trend at the moment for weddings is for live cooking stations \u2014 steak, pasta. It\u2019s impossible for people to do this at home,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, some families still do it the old way.\n\nIn Karachi\u2019s Lines neighborhood, a marquee sat on open ground in a residential area. There was no fancy decoration, expensive furniture or valet parking. In fact, there wasn\u2019t a bathroom. Guests arrived on motorbikes or in brightly colored buses.\n\nIn a makeshift outdoor kitchen, the wedding caterers were preparing kebabs and flatbread by flashlight because of an hours-long power cut.\n\nThe groom\u2019s family had rented a generator, but it broke down, leaving everyone in the dark just as the newlyweds began posing for photographs. The groom, Abdul Rehman, looked annoyed; the bride, Mehmoona, looked resigned. Guests whipped out their phones, using them as torches until the electricity came back.\n\nThe groom\u2019s uncle, Mehmood Anwar, said the family invited around 400 people, and event cost less than 400,000 rupees. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in spending so much money on a wedding,\u201d Anwar said. \u201cYou can give that money to your daughter or son-in-law.\n\n\u201cWe did everything ourselves. It took a full day to set this up,\u201d said Anwar, pride in his voice.\n\nBy the time March rolls around, Pakistanis will go back to dealing with the warmer weather and everyday woes, including the bills for all those parties. But for now, it\u2019s still Decemberistan.\n\n\u201cThe whole objective is, for that pocket of time, forget about everything that\u2019s dragging us down,\u201d Munir said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got political unrest. We\u2019ve got insane inflation like we\u2019ve never seen before... Every year we\u2019re just like, it can\u2019t get worse, but it does get worse. But, suddenly, December arrives.\u201d"}

He denies any wrongdoing. The trial is scheduled for Monday through Wednesday at a Barcelona courthouse.\n\nState prosecutors are seeking a nine-year prison sentence for Alves if convicted while the lawyers representing his accuser want 12 years.\n\nUnder Spain\u2019s 2022 sexual consent law, the crime of sexual assault takes in a wide array of crimes from online abuse and groping to rape, each with different possible punishments. A case of rape can carry a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\nAlves, now 40, was arrested on Jan. 20, 2023 after answering a police summons during a visit to Spain. A court ordered him to be jailed after analyzing the initial police investigation and hearing testimony from the alleged victim, witnesses and the player himself.\n\nBefore he was indicted by an investigative judge in August, Alves\u2019 lawyers unsuccessfully tried to discredit testimony by his accuser and other witnesses by presenting security camera footage at the nightclub. The court has said that any alleged flirting should not \u201cin any way justify an eventual sexual assault.\u201d\n\nAlves\u2019 requests for bail were denied because the court considered him a flight risk, even though he offered to hand over his passport and wear a tracking device. Brazil does not extradite its own citizens when they are sentenced in other countries.\n\nAlves has modified his defense several times.\n\nAt first, he denied having ever seen the woman when he went dancing at the Sutton nightclub in one of Barcelona\u2019s upscale neighborhoods.\n\nUpon his arrest, he denied any sexual contact with her, only to admit three months later to a sexual encounter that he said was consented to by the woman. He said he had been trying to save his marriage by not admitting to the sexual encounter initially.\n\nAnd after his indictment, he reportedly has alleged that he was drunk as an extenuating circumstance.\n\nAlves has changed attorneys three times. At the trial he will be represented by In\u00e9s Guardiola, a defense specialist, who he hired in October.\n\nThe alleged victim is represented by Ester Garc\u00eda, a specialist in prosecuting sex crimes.\n\nThe trial will be before a three-judge panel presided over by magistrate Isabel Delgado. Twenty-eight witnesses will give testimony between Monday and Tuesday before the court hears experts on Wednesday. The court will decide on Monday when Alves and his accuser testify.\n\nThe court has ordered that the accuser\u2019s testimony will be behind closed doors and that no image of her can be taken to protect her identity. That decision came after a video circulated on social media last month that allegedly identified the woman.\n\nThree days after his arrest, Alves was transferred by officials for safety reasons to the Brians 2 prison about 45 minutes northwest of Barcelona. He has been there ever since.\n\nAlves has been ordered to set aside 150,000 euros ($162,000) to pay his alleged victim if he is found guilty and ordered to pay damages.\n\nAlves\u2019 arrest shattered his image of a charismatic winner with a lengthy and successful career.\n\nHe won major titles with several elite clubs, including Barcelona, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain. He also helped Brazil win two Copa America trophies and an Olympic gold medal at age 38. He played at his third World Cup, the only major title he\u2019s not won, in 2022.\n\nThe right back was a key part of Barcelona\u2019s golden years playing between 2008-16 as a teammate of Lionel Messi. He won the Champions League three times during that stretch with the Catalan club, which he briefly rejoined in 2022.\n\nAlves had his contract with Mexican club Pumas terminated immediately after his arrest.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"}

Instead, many now see a very different future for drugs like psilocybin and LSD: as expensive, specialty medications controlled by a handful of biotech companies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d said Carey Turnbull, an investor and philanthropist who sits on the board of several psychedelic nonprofits. \u201cAll the air is getting sucked out of the room by these for-profit companies who say, \u2018Wow, this stuff is awesome, if I could patent it I\u2019d make a fortune.\u2019\u201d\n\nSince 2010, Turnbull and his wife have donated millions to fund psychedelic research at New York University, Yale and other top academic centers.\n\nPromising results from those studies have sparked a wave of popular interest in psychedelics, amplified by books, documentaries and articles touting their potential to reshape care for mental illness, trauma and end-of-life care.\n\nBut in recent years, Turnbull has pivoted to challenging what he and other advocates consider frivolous patents filed by companies entering the field.\n\nMost psychedelic startups are backed by venture capitalists or tech investors looking for the next industry \u201cdisruptor.\u201d Behind one of the biggest companies, Atai Life Sciences, is PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel, whose enthusiasm for psychedelics is shared by many in Silicon Valley.\n\nAbout 50 such companies now trade on public stock exchanges, including developers of psychedelic drugs, retreats and training programs. Some analysts project the industry could grow to over $10 billion within the decade.\n\nBut recently investors have pulled back, amid reminders of the stark challenges of converting illegal drugs into money-making medicines.\n\nAtai laid off 30% of its staff last March after its depression treatment failed in a key study. Stocks are down 80% to 90% from their highs across the industry with several smaller companies restructuring or declaring bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in this hype cycle, but then the reality of running a biotech company catches up with you,\u201d said Chris Yetter of Dumont Global, which trades in cannabis and psychedelic companies. \u201cYou do drug trials and some of them succeed and some fail and every quarter your cash drains away.\u201d\n\nThe cash crunch recently forced fundamental changes at the field\u2019s leading nonprofit, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies.\n\nFor more than 30 years, MAPS\u2019 efforts have been funded almost entirely by donations from wealthy individuals, including billionaires like New York Mets owner Steven Cohen and Republican political donor Rebekah Mercer. On principle, MAPS has never patented its work.\n\nThe group\u2019s pharmaceutical arm, the MAPS Public Benefit Corp., is expected to win U.S. approval this year for the first psychedelic medicine accepted for review by the Food and Drug Administration: MDMA, or ecstasy, to help treat post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nBut as investment opportunities have multiplied, charitable donations have dried up. The group was recently forced to take on private investors to continue funding the drug company, which changed its name to Lykos Therapeutics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a victim of our own success,\u201d said MAPS founder Rick Doblin. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking because I had hoped to go the whole way with philanthropy, but I was unable to raise the mega millions to do that.\u201d\n\nPsychedelics never fit the business model of the traditional blockbuster drug: an exclusive, patent-protected medicine that patients take regularly for years.\n\nNone of the psychedelics currently being studied are new. Synthetic drugs like LSD and ecstasy have been off patent for decades. Naturally occurring substances like psilocybin, found in certain mushrooms, can\u2019t be patented by themselves.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the challenge of administering drugs that bring about intense, disorienting visions and experiences. All the drugs vying for FDA approval will have to be given under professional supervision, typically during several therapy sessions lasting about six to eight hours each.\n\nAll those hours and professional fees will drive up costs, which many analysts say could range from $5,000 to $10,000 for one course of treatment.\n\nPsychedelic executives say the only way to defer those costs is to conduct large, rigorous clinical studies needed for FDA approval, which could compel insurers to pay for psychedelics. But funding those studies requires raising tens of millions from investors, who typically only back drugmakers with strong patents.\n\n\u201cThe only way you\u2019re going to bring about that broad and equitable access is with robust intellectual property,\u201d said Kabir Nath, CEO of Compass Pathways, which is studying laboratory-made psilocybin for depression, anorexia and other disorders.\n\nCompass is among the most aggressive companies in terms of trying to patent its technology, with dozens of applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nOne submission describes the \u201csoft furniture\u201d and \u201cmuted colors\u201d that would decorate rooms where patients take psilocybin. Another patent lays claim to a specific, microscopic structure found in Compass\u2019 synthetic psilocybin, which the company claims is uniquely suited for mass production.\n\nThe company\u2019s efforts have drawn ridicule from some researchers, who note that as early as the 1970s, psychedelic therapists had codified the settings and techniques described in Compass patents.\n\n\u201cIt just seems like a blatant power grab,\u201d said Frederick Barrett, a neuroscientist who directs Johns Hopkins University\u2019s psychedelic center.\n\nBut attempts to challenge the patents on Compass\u2019 synthetic psilocybin have been unsuccessful, despite years of work by Turnbull\u2019s patent watchdog group, Freedom to Operate.\n\nOther companies are taking more creative approaches to patenting psychedelics, such as reformulating them as dissolvable lozenges or films \u2014 or combining LSD and ecstasy into a combination pill. Skeptics note that that approach, dubbed \u201ccandyflipping,\u201d has been used recreationally for decades.\n\nOne of the more intriguing reformulation efforts involves trying to shorten the duration of the psychedelic experience, or even do away with it entirely, while retaining the psychological benefits for patients.\n\nThe rush to innovate worries some psychiatrists who point to the many fundamental questions about psychedelics that remain unanswered, including exactly how they affect the brain and how long their benefits might last.\n\nAs companies develop more psychedelic derivatives and combinations, deciphering their strengths and weaknesses will become more challenging, says Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman of Columbia University. Unless researchers can clearly demonstrate their benefits, they risk another backlash like the 1970 federal ban that wiped out psychedelic research for decades.\n\n\u201cPsychedelics could have tremendous benefit for treating a number of illnesses,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cBut if we mess it up and rush the process, these drugs are going to get banned again and you lose that opportunity.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

He and Springsteen traded guitar licks on \u201cWho Says You Can\u2019t Go Home\u201d as scenes of New Jersey were projected behind them.\n\nWith the crowd on its feet for a standing ovation, they segued into Springsteen\u2019s \u201cThe Promised Land,\u201d with Bon Jovi on harmonica before Springsteen joined him.\n\nBon Jovi then retreated to his star-studded table in the crowd. He was joined by his wife, Dorothea, Paul McCartney and his wife, Nancy, Springsteen, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and actor-singer Rita Wilson.\n\nSpringsteen appeared two days after his 98-year-old mother Adele died.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got the news he was already on the airplane on his way here,\u201d Bon Jovi told the crowd. \u201cI certainly would have understood if he\u2019d said that he couldn\u2019t make it, but he wanted to be here tonight for MusiCares and he wanted to be here tonight for me, and I am forever grateful to you.\u201d\n\nMelissa Etheridge was joined by Larkin Poe for a rip-roaring version of \u201cBlaze of Glory\u201d two days before the Grammy Awards.\n\nBest new artist nominee Jelly Roll performed \u201cBad Medicine\u201d and Lainey Wilson sang \u201cWe Weren\u2019t Born to Follow.\u201d\n\nPat Monahan of Train tackled \u201cIt\u2019s My Life\u201d as Bon Jovi bobbed his head in time to the music.\n\nClad in black-fringed leather, Shania Twain sang \u201cBed of Roses\u201d as the hall was bathed in red lighting. Bon Jovi touched his hand to his heart as she closed out the ballad.\n\nJason Isbell did \u201cWanted Dead or Alive\u201d and Damiano David of M\u00e5neskin sang \u201cKeep the Faith.\u201d\n\nThe War and Treaty took the crowd to church with their soulful in-the-round performance of \u201cI\u2019ll Be There for You\u201d that earned a standing ovation.\n\nVan Halen fans got a treat when the band\u2019s former lead singer, Sammy Hagar, did \u201cYou Give Love a Bad Name\u201d with Orianthi on guitar. Wolfgang Van Halen and his Mammoth WVH came out later to do \u201cHave a Nice Day.\u201d\n\nBrandy Clark, a six-time nominee on Sunday, played guitar and sang \u201c(You Want to) Make a Memory\u201d in the round backed by piano and cello.\n\nComedian Jim Gaffigan hosted and relentlessly mocked Bon Jovi for his big hair and penchant for wearing short-shorts in the 1980s. Proof of the rocker\u2019s questionable sartorial choices were flashed on video screens around the hall.\n\n\u201cDoes it feel like you\u2019re looking in a mirror?\u201d Gaffigan said when he later walked out dressed in a Jack Daniels sleeveless T-shirt, denim shorts, spiked hair and cowboy boots.\n\nBon Jovi broke out laughing.\n\n\u201cLivin\u2019 On a Prayer\u201d became an all-star finale, with Bon Jovi joined onstage by the other performers for a singalong.\n\nKraft presented Bon Jovi with his award as MusiCares Person of the Year. The two first met on the sidelines at the 1997 Super Bowl.\n\nBon Jovi founded the JBJ Soul Kitchen Food Bank and his Soul Foundation, a nonprofit that operates community restaurants in three New Jersey cities. His foundation also has helped fund more than 700 units of affordable housing in 11 states and the District of Columbia.\n\n\u201cTonight and every night I know how blessed I\u2019ve been,\u201d Bon Jovi said.\n\nNow in its 34th year, the dinner and auction raised money for programs and services supporting musicians in need.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of singer Sammy Hagar\u2019s last name to Hagar, not Hager.\n\n___\n\nFor more coverage of the 2024 Grammys, visit https://apnews.com/hub/grammy-awards"}

State legislatures are grappling with if and how to legalize the drug, while several marijuana-related bills \u2013 including those aiming to decriminalize it on the federal level \u2013 have been introduced in Congress. The House passed a marijuana decriminalization bill on April 1, 2022 and months later, several senators \u2013 including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2013 introduced the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, which would federally decriminalize weed, as reported by Marijuana Moment . The bill has not been moved forward.\n\nThe movement toward relaxing punishment on marijuana use took a new turn in October 2022, when President Joe Biden said he would issue pardons to everyone convicted of the federal crime of simple marijuana possession, while calling for governors to make similar moves for convictions under state laws. The proclamation will apply to about 6,500 Americans, but a senior White House official clarified to reporters that no one is currently behind bars for simple possession of marijuana.\n\nOpponents say marijuana poses a public health and safety risk, and some are morally against legalization. Proponents, however, argue that it is not as dangerous as alcohol and point to evidence that it has therapeutic benefits, such as stress and pain relief.\n\nAdvocates also see it as a moneymaker for states and a necessary social justice initiative. Marijuana laws have disproportionately affected people from minority communities, contributing to mass incarceration. States where the drug is legal have sought to retroactively address the consequences of marijuana prohibition, often including provisions allowing for the expungement or vacation of low-level marijuana convictions.\n\nA December 2022 study published by the American Medical Association found that complete legalization reduces marijuana-related arrests even in states that had already decriminalized cannabis, meaning the drug is still illegal but a person would not be prosecuted for possession under a specified amount.\n\nStates where legal recreational marijuana has been approved:\n\nRetail marijuana hit the shelves in Vermont in October 2022 and in New York in December of that year. The District of Columbia, on the other hand, still doesn\u2019t have a regulated recreational market despite marijuana use being legal there. Meanwhile, Guam\u2019s retail industry has been taking shape slowly.\n\nElsewhere, Ohio voters approved a ballot measure in November 2023, making it the latest state to act to legalize recreational marijuana. But in Oklahoma, a ballot measure that would have legalized recreational use failed to get enough votes on March 7, 2023.\n\n\n\nStates have their own processes for licensing dispensaries, but in all states where marijuana is legal, businesses that sell marijuana must have a license from the state to do so.\n\nThe sales are regulated and taxed by the states at varying rates. Some states implement an excise tax on the sales, which are taxes on a particular good \u2013 in this case, marijuana \u2013 levied on the seller, which typically passes it on to the consumer by including it in the product's price.\n\nProvisions outlining the amount of marijuana an adult can legally possess, if adults can grow their own marijuana plants and how the tax revenue is spent vary from state to state.\n\nAdults over the age of 21 in Colorado can possess and give away up to an ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants each , though residences are limited to 12 plants total no matter how many people live there. Using marijuana in public is illegal.\n\nRetail purchases at licensed dispensaries are subject to standard sales tax, plus an additional 10% marijuana sales tax . A 15% excise tax is applied to the wholesale price of retail marijuana \u2013 that is, the price that businesses pay cultivators.\n\nIn Washington , adults over 21 can buy and possess up to an ounce of marijuana, 16 ounces of marijuana-infused edibles in solid form, 72 ounces of marijuana-infused liquid products, and 7 grams of marijuana concentrates. It's illegal to consume marijuana in public, and recreational users can't grow the plants at home.\n\nRetail sales are legal at licensed dispensaries and there is a 37% excise tax on those sales.\n\nAlaskan adults over the age of 21 can possess and give away up to an ounce of marijuana and can grow up to six marijuana plants, though only three of those plants can be mature. It's illegal to consume the drug in public.\n\nRetail sales are legal at licensed dispensaries. The state levies an excise tax on the drug that the cultivator is responsible for paying.\n\nAdults in Oregon who are over 21 years old can possess up to an ounce of marijuana if they are in public and up to 8 ounces at home. Adults can also have up to 16 ounces of a marijuana product if it is in solid form, like an edible, or up to 72 ounces of a marijuana product in liquid form. Adults can grow up to four cannabis plants. It's illegal in Oregon to use marijuana in a public place.\n\nMarijuana retail sales are legal at licensed dispensaries and taxed at 17%, and cities and counties can add up to an additional 3% tax in some cases.\n\nIt is legal for adults over 21 to possess up to 2 ounces of marijuana and to give up to 1 ounce of marijuana to another person. Adults can also grow up to six marijuana plants, three of which can be mature.\n\nRecreational cannabis sales are not legal in D.C., as Congressional Republicans have consistently included language in appropriations bills that prevents the District from establishing an independent regulatory board. Without licensed retailers, D.C.'s adult-use marijuana trade relies on gifting services.\n\nIt is legal in California for an adult over 21 to possess, purchase or give away up to an ounce of cannabis and as much as 8 grams of concentrated cannabis. Adults can also cultivate up to six live cannabis plants. Smoking or ingesting marijuana is illegal in public places, as is using the drug while in a car.\n\nRetail sales of cannabis at licensed dispensaries are subject to standard state sales tax and an excise tax of 15%. Local governments may also enact additional taxes on cannabis businesses.\n\nPeople over 21 in Maine can use and possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana and grow up to six flowering and 12 immature marijuana plants.\n\nA regulated retail market became operational in October 2020, though several owners saw limited product supplies. Maine imposes a 15% excise tax and a 10% sales tax on marijuana.\n\nAdults over 21 in Massachusetts can have up to an ounce of marijuana on their person and up to 10 ounces at home. Home cultivation is also permitted: Residents can grow up to six plants per person and up to 12 plants in a household of two or more people.\n\nSales are legal at licensed dispensaries. Sales are subject to standard state sales tax, as well as a state excise tax of 10.75%. Towns and cities can also levy up to a 3% tax on marijuana sales.\n\nNevadans over 21 can have up to an ounce of marijuana and up to an eighth of an ounce of concentrated marijuana. Adults may also grow up to six plants , or 12 plants per household. It's illegal to use marijuana in public or in a car.\n\nRetail sales are legal at licensed dispensaries, and are subject to a 10% excise tax on top of state sales tax.\n\nIn June 2023, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo signed a marijuana reform bill that more than doubled Nevada\u2019s legal personal possession limit and consolidated licensing rules.\n\nIt is legal for adults over 21 in Michigan to grow, consume and possess marijuana. The law allows individuals to grow up to 12 plants in a household, and to possess up to 2.5 ounces of the drug and 15 grams of concentrated marijuana.\n\nThe state's Marijuana Regulatory Agency began accepting applications for retail licenses in late 2019. Michigan now operates licensed retailers for recreational cannabis use, as well as provisioning centers for medical use, according to David Harns, interim communications director for Michigan's Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.\n\nIt was legal to grow and possess marijuana in Vermont, but not to buy or sell it at first \u2013 that changed in October 2022, when retailers started receiving licenses. Adults over 21 can have up to an ounce of marijuana and can grow two mature and four immature marijuana plants per household.\n\nAdults over the age of 21 can possess up to an ounce of marijuana and can grow up to six plants, though no more than three can be mature.\n\nGuam's Cannabis Control Board scrambled to establish trading guidelines earlier in 2020, but its progress was stopped at the time by the coronavirus pandemic. The island has made more progress in establishing its recreational market since then.\n\nAs of January 2020, it's legal for Illinois residents over 21 to possess 30 grams of marijuana , 5 grams of concentrated cannabis and products containing up to 500 milligrams of THC. Adults who are not Illinois residents can have half those amounts while in the state. Consumption remains illegal in public places.\n\nResidents could initially purchase marijuana for adult use from licensed dispensaries, followed by a gradual rollout of recreational retail licenses. Sales are taxed based on how much THC the marijuana contains: Cannabis with more than 35% THC will be taxed at 25% while cannabis with less THC will be taxed at 10%. Though marijuana has become more potent over the years, it's still unusual for a strain to exceed 35% THC. Cannabis-infused products will be subject to a 20% tax. Local municipalities can also levy up to a 3% tax on sales.\n\nNew Jersey was among four new states to simultaneously back marijuana legalization measures on Election Day 2020. Nearly 67% of voters approved a ballot initiative to legalize marijuana. The measure outlines that only adults over the age of 21 would be able to use cannabis. It authorized the existing state commission on medical cannabis to govern the market for recreational use, and made the cannabis trade subject to state and local taxes. On Feb. 22, 2021, Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation formally establishing the state's recreational marketplace, while reducing penalties for underage possession of marijuana and alcohol.\n\nMontana's Election Day 2020 ballot featured two popular-vote measures that would regulate the use of recreational marijuana. Initiative 190 \u2013 legalizing the possession and use of limited amounts of cannabis by adults 21 and over \u2013 was approved by nearly 57% of voters, according to the Montana secretary of state. Montana Constitutional Initiative 118 \u2013 which allows the state legislature to set an age for marijuana use and consumption \u2013 passed with 58% of the vote.\n\nSouth Dakota\u2019s Constitutional Amendment A appeared on the 2020 ballot, passing with roughly 54% of the vote. The measure allows adults over 21 years old to possess and distribute up to 1 ounce of cannabis. A simultaneous measure to legalize medical marijuana was approved by nearly 70% of voters, according to the Sioux Falls-based Argus Leader. But in late November 2021, the state Supreme Court nullified the voter-passed amendment that would have allowed for recreational marijuana use, as reported by The Associated Press . The decision followed a lawsuit backed by Republican Gov. Kristi Noem. A similar measure failed to get enough votes in the state in November 2022.\n\nArizona's Proposition 207 would allow limited marijuana use, possession and cultivation by adults over age 21; ban smoking it in public; establish state and local regulation of marijuana licensees; and allow marijuana offenses to be expunged. About 60% of voters supported the measure on Election Day.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo signed the Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act on March 31, 2021. The law allows individuals age 21 or older to possess up to 3 ounces of cannabis for recreational purposes, establishes two regulatory agencies to oversee its sale and distribution, and clears the way for individuals convicted of marijuana-related offenses to have their records expunged. Democrats in the State Assembly had been introducing legalization bills since 2013, but their efforts were unsuccessful due to disagreements with Cuomo, according to the New York Times. The state finally started its sales of legal, adult-use regulated cannabis in late December 2022.\n\nOn April 7, 2021, both chambers of Virginia's General Assembly passed SB1406, with amendments put forth by Gov. Ralph Northam. Since the legislature approved the governor's amendments, no further action was needed to pass the law, a staff member for Northam confirmed. The amended legislation allows Virginians age 21 or older to possess up to 1 ounce of recreational marijuana as of July 1, 2021. While the law also allows residents to grow up to four cannabis plants, the measure as enacted doesn't establish a framework for licensing retail sales of adult-use marijuana. As of January 2023, the recreational market for marijuana in Virginia had an uncertain future, with a bill establishing a framework for retail sales still under consideration by the state\u2019s politically divided government, as reported by WRIC-TV .\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed HB2 on April 12, allowing adults over age 21 to grow cannabis plants at home and possess up to two ounces outside their homes as of June 29, according to Linda Trujillo, the state's regulation and licensing superintendent. State-licensed dispensaries started selling recreational marijuana on April 1, 2022. Home growers of cannabis are able to cultivate up to six plants per person, or 12 total per household.\n\nConnecticut legalized recreational cannabis on June 22, 2021, when Gov. Ned Lamont signed SB1201 . When the measure took effect on July 1, individuals aged 21 or older were then able to possess up to 1.5 ounces of recreational cannabis, in addition to another five ounces in a home or vehicle. Prior low-level marijuana offenses were also expunged under the new law. Retail sales eventually began in January 2023.\n\nRhode Island Gov. Dan McKee signed into law on May 25, 2022, a state legislature bill that legalizes, regulates and taxes cannabis in the state. The law legalizes possession of up to an ounce of cannabis and cultivation of up to three cannabis plants in a private residence for adults 21 and older, according to the Marijuana Policy Project . Sales \u2013 overseen by a new regulatory commission \u2013 officially began in December 2022.\n\nVoters\u2019 Election Day ballot approval of Question 4 paved the way for Maryland adults to possess and use cannabis as early as July 2023. Companion legislation passed in the Maryland General Assembly stipulates that citizens would be allowed to possess up to 1.5 ounces, repeals the term \u201cmarijuana\u201d and replaces it with cannabis, and offers a pathway toward expungement and resentencing for people convicted of certain cannabis offenses. State lawmakers unveiled a bill in early February that details how Maryland would tax and regulate cannabis, according to Marijuana Moment .\n\nVoters in Missouri also approved recreational marijuana legalization on Election Day 2022 through a ballot measure, which will limit possession to up to 3 ounces. The result cleared the path for legalized cannabis use in a state that was among the 10 with the most marijuana possession arrests reported by state and local agencies between 2017 and 2021, according to a U.S. News analysis of data available through the FBI. A registration card will be required for \u201cpersonal cultivation,\u201d there will be a 6% tax on the retail price of cannabis and citizens with certain non-violent marijuana-related offenses can petition to have their records expunged. Retail sales later began on Feb. 3 after the state health department began approving dispensary permits earlier than anticipated, according to the AP .\n\nIn a unique situation within the realm of marijuana legalization in states, a recreational cannabis bill became law in Delaware on April 23, 2023 without the signature of Gov. John Carney, a Democrat. The governor, who had previously vetoed a legalization bill, allowed the measure through but clarified in a statement that his views \u201chave not changed,\u201d according to the AP. While the governor previously expressed concerns about marijuana\u2019s effects on young people and highway safety, he said he decided not to veto the bill because Delaware officials have \u201cspent far too much time focused on this issue, when Delawareans face more serious and pressing concerns every day.\u201d The legalization bill allows state residents aged 21 and older to possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana but prohibits them from growing their own for personal consumption. A separate bill \u2013 which was set to become law on April 27, the AP reported \u2013 creates the recreational industry for Delaware by calling on state officials to issue up to 30 initial retail cannabis licenses, 30 manufacturing licenses and other related licenses.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tim Walz on May 30 signed a bill to make Minnesota the 23rd state to legalize recreational marijuana, calling it the \u201cright move\u201d for his state. The law, which also directs the expungement or resentencing of cannabis-related convictions, created a new government agency to regulate the industry. Such regulations include a 10% tax on recreational marijuana. While using and possessing some amounts of cannabis will be decriminalized for Minnesotans aged 21 and older starting August 1, 2023, the actual retail cannabis industry will not launch until the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe state became the 24th to act to legalize recreational marijuana when a majority of voters approved a corresponding ballot measure on Nov. 7, 2023. The new law \u2013 pending tweaks from the Republican-controlled state legislature, which failed to pass it previously \u2013 will allow adults 21 and older to grow plants at home as well as buy and possess up to 2.5 ounces of cannabis, with a 10% tax added to purchases at dispensaries. It is set to go into effect 30 days after the election, according to the ballot measure\u2019s language , though the process of setting up retail dispensaries is expected to take months. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine had opposed its passage, saying in the days leading up to the election that he didn\u2019t \u201cthink the little bit of money that this will generate to the state of Ohio is worth the damage to the people of Ohio.\u201d\n\nIs marijuana legal at the federal level?\n\nNo. Marijuana is classified at the federal level as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, meaning that the government believes it to have no medical use and a high potential for abuse. Cultivating, distributing and possessing marijuana violates federal drug laws. But President Biden\u2019s proclamation on Oct. 7, 2022, included a request for the secretary of health and human services and the attorney general \u201cto initiate the administrative process to review expeditiously how marijuana is scheduled under federal law.\u201d\n\nStates that have legalized either recreational or medical marijuana have done so in direct conflict with the federal government, creating tension between the rights of states to create their own laws and the authority of the federal government.\n\nThe federal government has, however, generally taken a hands-off approach to marijuana prohibition enforcement in states where the drug is legal. In 2009, the Obama administration told federal prosecutors to consider not prosecuting people who distributed marijuana in accordance with state medical marijuana laws.\n\nWhat is the Cole Memorandum?\n\nIn 2013, the Justice Department issued perhaps the most influential memo on federal marijuana enforcement. Known as the Cole Memorandum , the Justice Department said it would not challenge states' legalization laws at that time and expected states to have robust enforcement efforts of their own.\n\nThen-Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo in 2018, and told prosecutors to use established prosecutorial principles and their own judgment when prosecuting \u2013 or declining to pursue \u2013 marijuana charges.\n\nThe Justice Department has in general declined to pursue cases where individuals are acting in compliance with state law, and it has also not challenged state legalization laws in court. Observers note that even after Cole's withdrawal, most marijuana-related prosecutions by the Department of Justice have focused on more serious charges such as firearms or organized crime.\n\nWhat does decriminalization mean?\n\nDecriminalization is, broadly defined, the reduction of penalties for a certain criminal act or the process of reclassifying a criminal offense as a civil offense.\n\nAs of November 2023, the Marijuana Policy Project reports that 31 states and the District of Columbia have decriminalized low-level marijuana possession offenses, typically removing the possibility of jail time at least for first time-offenses, though the possibility of a fine or a criminal record remains in some places. Some states have reclassified the possession of small amounts of weed as a civil, instead of criminal, offense, while others have just reduced the penalties. In most of those states, repeat offenses, sales, distribution or possession of large amounts of marijuana can still land you in jail.\n\nOf the states that have passed decriminalization measures, some have medical marijuana laws. Two states have decriminalized marijuana but not legalized it in any form, according to the Policy Project.\n\nDecriminalization is often seen as a middle ground between full-blown legalization and strict, punitive drug policy that has disproportionately affected communities of color.\n\nWhere does the public stand on the issue?\n\nA growing majority of Americans believe that recreational marijuana should be legal. A CBS News/YouGov poll released in April 2022 found that two-thirds of Americans want recreational marijuana use to be legalized under federal law and in their own state. A previous Pew Research Center survey found similar levels of support for marijuana legalization.\n\nAmericans have warmed significantly to the idea in recent years. Just 12% of U.S. adults supported legalization in 1969, according to a November 2021 Gallup poll \u2013 a figure that rose to 31% in 2000 before accelerating above 50% after 2013 and to a record high of 68% most recently.\n\nDemocrats are more likely to support legalization, though a majority of Republicans are now in favor of it, Gallup found. People under age 30 are similarly more likely to back marijuana legalization \u2013 81% of those respondents in 2019 \u2013 but 62% of Americans aged 50 to 64 also supported legalization, a previous version of the Gallup survey found."}

The 19-year-old college student's infamous abduction in Berkeley, California, led to Hearst joining forces with her captors for a 1974 bank robbery that earned her a prison sentence.\n\nHearst, granddaughter of wealthy newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, will turn 70 on Feb. 20. She is now known as Patricia Hearst Shaw after she married a police officer who guarded her when she was out on bail, the late Bernard Shaw. She has been in the news in recent years for her dogs, mostly French bulldogs, that have won prizes in the Westminster Kennel Club dog show.\n\nHearst's allegiance to the Symbionese Liberation Army raised questions about Stockholm syndrome, a common term deployed to describe the bond that victims of kidnappings or hostage situations sometimes develop with their captors.\n\nStockholm syndrome got its name from an August 1973 failed bank robbery in Sweden\u2019s capital. Rather than a diagnosis of a disorder, experts describe it as a psychological coping mechanism used by some hostages to endure being held captive and abused.\n\nHearst, who went by the name \u201cTania\u201d in the group, denounced her family and posed for a photograph carrying a weapon in front of their flag. The self-styled radicals viewed aspects of U.S. society as racist and oppressive, and they were accused of killing a California school superintendent.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nAs a member of a wealthy and powerful family, Hearst was kidnapped to bring attention to the Symbionese Liberation Army, according to the FBI. The group demanded food and money donations for the poor in exchange for Hearst's release, though she remained a captive even after her family met the ransom through a $2 million food distribution program.\n\nHearst took part in the group's robbery of a San Francisco bank on April 15, 1974. Surveillance cameras captured her wielding an assault rifle during the crime.\n\nShe wasn't arrested until the FBI caught up with her on Sept. 18, 1975, in San Francisco, 19 months after her abduction.\n\nHer trial was one of the most sensational of that decade. The prosecutor played a jail cell recording of Hearst talking with a friend in which she was confident, cursing and fully aware of her role with the Symbionese Liberation Army.\n\nWhile Hearst was sentenced to seven years in prison, President Jimmy Carter commuted her sentence in 1979 after she served 22 months behind bars. She later was pardoned by President Bill Clinton."}

More than 2,000 cities nationwide have enacted such policies since the 1990s, according to the Chicago-based Shriver Center on Poverty Law. The International Crime Free Association says at least 3,000 international cities also use them.\n\nUnder such ordinances, landlords can be fined or lose their rental licenses if they don\u2019t evict tenants whose actions are considered a public nuisance, including those selling drugs or suspected of other crimes. They also can be required to screen potential tenants and limit the number of people living in a home or apartment.\n\nBut every ordinance is different: unique in what it targets, how it is enforced and what kind of consequences are levied for violating it. Many also are vague about who and what is considered a public nuisance.\n\nIn Anoka, Minnesota, the Minneapolis suburb scrutinized by the DOJ, the \u201cCrime Free Housing\u201d ordinance covers excessive noise, \u201cunfounded calls to police\" and allowing a \u201cphysically offensive condition.\u201d While the ordinance says a nuisance call involves \u201cdisorderly conduct,\u201d such as criminal activity and acts jeopardizing others, it doesn't define unfounded calls or physically offensive conditions.\n\nCritics, and courts, say those subjective ambiguities have allowed discrimination against certain groups of people.\n\nWHAT PROBLEMS CAN THESE LAWS POSE?\n\nFederal fair housing laws bar landlords from asking whether someone has a disability, including a mental health disability, or refusing to rent to them on that basis. But many crime-free laws direct landlords to screen rental applicants, sometimes by the same officials who decide whether emergency calls for help or about an individual's demeanor will count against a tenant or the landlord themself.\n\nSome jurisdictions also share detailed information about those calls with landlords, which housing activists say is often further shared among landlords when discussing why they don\u2019t view a past tenant as a good rental prospect.\n\nOne such law in Hesperia, California, spawned a federal lawsuit after a resident was forced to leave her home and move into a motel after calling for assistance when her boyfriend had a mental health crisis. The town\u2019s ordinance required landlords to have potential tenants\u2019 applications screened by the local sheriff\u2019s office. The agency, according to the lawsuit, then shared with landlords a list of people it flagged as potentially troublesome renters.\n\nAdvocates say reluctance to rent to people previously hospitalized for mental health issues, as well as city policies that discourage renting to people who have been arrested, exacerbates the situation.\n\nPeople face being homeless or \u201cforced to cycle from an institution to a homeless shelter,\u201d said Corey Bernstein, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network.\n\nA lack of community services often means jails serve as \u201cde facto psychiatric centers\u201d for people with mental illnesses, said Devon Orland, litigation director at the disability rights Georgia Advocacy Office.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen people on street corners yelling or getting upset,\u201d Orland said. \u201cThat locality doesn\u2019t want them around and then they reappear or they don\u2019t leave immediately and they get arrested for criminal trespass.\u201d\n\nWHERE ARE THE LAWS MOST OFTEN ENFORCED?\n\nCritical studies and lawsuits indicate enforcement of nuisance laws frequently occur in poorer neighborhoods and communities of color.\n\nAn August 2018 report from the American Civil Liberties Union and New York Civil Liberties Union said data from Rochester and Troy, New York, showed the most vigorous enforcement of \u201cno crime\u201d and \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d laws occurred in poor and heavily minority areas.\n\nA 2017 federal lawsuit against Peoria, Illinois, similarly plotted three years\u2019 worth of data on a map of the city and found almost all nuisance citations were issued in neighborhoods with larger percentages of residents of color.\n\nOther studies and lawsuits indicate such ordinances are typically in response to an influx of residents of color, often from larger communities such as Cleveland or Los Angeles.\n\nWhen the DOJ sued Hesperia, a city of about 101,000 residents about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, in 2019, the agency said officials there had made it clear their ordinance was a reaction to an increasing number of residents of color.\n\nThe lawsuit quoted one council member saying \u201cthose kind of people\u201d coming from the Los Angeles area were of \u201cno value\u201d and \u201cI want their butt kicked out of this community as fast as I can possibly humanly get it done.\u201d\n\nOther lawsuits have concluded crime-free policies hurt domestic abuse victims for repeatedly calling for help from police.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development filed a complaint in 2013 against the Philadelphia community of Norristown, Pennsylvania, over an ordinance it said allowed the town to sanction landlords over \u201cdomestic disturbances that do not require that a mandatory arrest be made.\u201d\n\nA Black resident had filed a federal lawsuit over a series of 2012 incidents involving an abusive boyfriend. She was told by police that she faced eviction over the emergency calls and later did not call police after her boyfriend stabbed her in the neck. A neighbor called police and the woman was airlifted to a hospital for emergency care, the lawsuit said.\n\nWHERE ARE THESE LAWS BEING CHALLENGED?\n\nAt least a few states are trying to limit the reach of such ordinances.\n\nMaryland last year prohibited cities and counties from penalizing landlords and now prevents landlords from evicting tenants over the number of police or emergency calls to their addresses. At the start of this year, California greatly limited cities\u2019 use of crime-free policies. Advocates expect a similar push for such legislation in Illinois.\n\nHousing advocates and civil liberties groups also have challenged ordinances in multiple states, including California, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania, forcing cities to rewrite or repeal their ordinances in legal settlements.\n\nSome communities have backed off on their own.\n\nIn the Minneapolis area, the communities of Golden Valley, St. Louis Park and Bloomington repealed most or all of their ordinances starting in 2020.\n\nOther area cities have rewritten their ordinances, including Faribault in 2022 as it agreed to pay $685,000 to settle a federal lawsuit over the law.\n\n___\n\nHanna reported from Topeka, Kansas."}

(AP) \u2014 Wisconsin Democrats are inching closer to overturning Republican-drawn legislative maps that the GOP has used over the past 13 years to grow their majorities and advance their agenda.\n\nAt issue in battleground Wisconsin are the boundaries for state Assembly and Senate districts in a purple state where Republicans have held a firm grip on control of the Legislature even as Democrats have notched significant statewide wins.\n\nRepublicans drew the lines in 2011 and Democratic court challenges have since failed to overturn them, until now. Republican maps adopted in 2022 by the conservative-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court used the 2011 map as a template and kept largely the same lines in place.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 latest lawsuit alleged the lines drawn by Republicans were unconstitutional because not all of the districts were contiguous, meaning some areas were disconnected from the rest of the district. The Wisconsin Supreme Court in December agreed and ordered new maps to be drawn in time for the November election.\n\nHere's a look at where things currently stand.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE?\n\nWho has the most boundary lines. When Republicans took over majority control following the 2010 election they had a 19-14 edge in the Senate and 57-38 in the Assembly. After the 2022 election, their majorities increased to 22-11 in the Senate and a 65-34 supermajority in the Assembly.\n\nWHAT ARE THE POLITICS?\n\nDemocrats filed their latest lawsuit the day after the Wisconsin Supreme Court flipped to majority liberal control in August after the election win by Justice Janet Protasiewicz. Her vote was the difference maker in the 4-3 December ruling tossing the Republican maps.\n\nWHAT CAN REPUBLICANS DO?\n\nRepublicans are running out of options to stop the lines from being redrawn. They argued Protasiewicz shouldn't hear the lawsuit because she said during her campaign that the GOP-drawn maps were \u201crigged\u201d and \u201cunfair.\u201d But she did not recuse herself. Now Republicans are talking about raising that issue, and others, in an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court alleging due process violations.\n\nWHAT WILL THE NEW MAPS LOOK LIKE?\n\nConsultants hired by the Wisconsin Supreme Court on Thursday said that maps submitted by the Republican Legislature and a conservative law firm were gerrymandered. They did not raise concerns about any of the four other Democratic-drawn maps but left the question of constitutionality to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe consultants determined the four remaining maps were virtually the same, and tweaks could be made by them or the court to bolster how well each map meets certain criteria including contiguity, political balance and preserving communities of interest.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nResponses to the consultants' report are due on Feb. 8.\n\nIn public statements, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Democratic attorneys praised their findings and said Wisconsin is closer than ever to ending Republican gerrymandering. Republicans, meanwhile, blasted the report backing the Democratic maps as bogus and a \u201cfog of faux sophistication.\u201d\n\nThe court could ask the consultants to make revisions to a map, or the court could adopt one of the four proposals already submitted.\n\nIt's likely the new maps will come out between Feb. 9 and March 15, the deadline that the Wisconsin Elections Commission gave for new lines to be in place for the fall election. The deadline ensures candidates know the district lines before they take out nomination papers to get on the ballot.\n\nWHAT ABOUT OTHER CHALLENGES?\n\nLitigation continues in more than a dozen states over U.S. House and state legislative districts that were enacted after the 2020 census.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court also has been asked by Democrats to take up a challenge to the state\u2019s congressional district lines.

When he left her alone in the vehicle, she stole a digital memory card from the center console.\n\nNow, more than four years later, what she found on that card is key to a double murder trial set to begin this week: gruesome photos and videos of a woman being beaten and strangled at a Marriott hotel, her attacker speaking in a strong accent as he urged her to die, her blanket-covered body being snuck outside on a luggage cart.\n\n\u201cIn my movies, everybody always dies,\u201d the voice says on one video. \"What are my followers going to think of me? People need to know when they are being serial-killed.\u201d\n\nAbout a week after she took the SD card, the woman turned it over to police, who said they recognized the voice as that of Brian Steven Smith, now 52, a South Africa native they knew from a prior investigation, court documents say.\n\nSmith has pleaded not guilty to 14 charges, including first- and second-degree murder, sexual assault and tampering with evidence, in the deaths of Kathleen Henry, 30, and Veronica Abouchuk, who was 52 when her family reported her missing in February 2019, seven months after they last saw her.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nHenry and Abouchuk were both Alaska Native women who had experienced homelessness. They were from small villages in western Alaska, Henry from Eek and Abouchuk from Stebbins.\n\nAuthorities say Henry was the victim whose death was recorded at the TownePlace Suites by Marriott, a hotel in midtown Anchorage. Smith was registered to stay there from Sept. 2 to Sept. 4, 2019; the first images showing her body were time-stamped at about 1 a.m. on Sept. 4, police said.\n\nThe last images on the card were taken early on Sept. 6 and showed Henry's body in the back of a black pickup, according to charging documents. Location data showed that at the time the photo was taken, Smith's phone was in the area of Rainbow Valley Road, along the Seward Highway south of Anchorage, the same area where Henry's body was found several weeks later, police said.\n\nAs detectives interrogated Smith about the Marriott case, authorities said, he offered up more information to police who escorted him to a bathroom: He had killed another woman, and he went on to identify her \u2014 Abouchuk \u2014 from a photo and to provide the location of her remains, along the Old Glenn Highway north of Anchorage.\n\n\u201cWith no prompting, he tells the troopers in the bathroom, \u2018I\u2019m going to make you famous,\u2019\u201d District Attorney Brittany Dunlop said during a court hearing last week. \u201cHe comes back in and says ... \u2018You guys got some more time? You want to keep talking?\u2019 And then discloses this other murder.\u201d\n\nAlaska State Troopers in 2018 incorrectly identified another body as that of Abouchuk, because Abouchuk's ID had been discovered with it, for reasons that remain unclear. But with the information Smith provided, investigators re-examined the case and used dental records to confirm a skull with a bullet wound found in the area Smith identified was Abouchuk's, authorities have said.\n\nSmith's attorney, Timothy Ayer, unsuccessfully sought to have the digital memory card's evidence \u2014 or even mention of it \u2014 excluded at trial. The woman who turned in the card initially claimed she had simply found it on the street, and it wasn't until a second interview that she confessed she had stolen the card from Smith's truck while he tried to get money from an ATM and she had it for a week before giving it to police, he said.\n\nFor that reason, he argued, prosecutors would not be able to demonstrate the provenance of the 39 photos and 12 videos, establish whether they were originals or duplicates, or say for sure whether they had been tampered with.\n\n\u201cThe state cannot produce a witness to testify that the video fairly and accurately depicts any act that actually happened,\u201d Ayer wrote.\n\nHowever, Third Judicial District Judge Kevin Saxby ruled late Friday that the woman can testify about her possession of the card until she handed it over to police and that the recordings can be properly authenticated.\n\nHenry\u2019s family has not spoken publicly about her death and efforts to reach relatives have not been successful. Abouchuk\u2019s family has not returned messages from The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThese were two Alaska Native women,\u201d Dunlop, then the assistant district attorney, said in 2019 after Smith was charged. \u201cAnd I know that hits home here in Alaska, and we\u2019re cognizant of that. We treat them with dignity and respect.\u201d\n\nAuthorities said Smith, who is in custody at the Anchorage Correctional Facility, came to Alaska in 2014 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen the same month Henry was killed.\n\nIn a 2019 letter to the AP, he declined to discuss the case. He added that he was doing well: \"I have lost weight, I have much less stress and I am sober.\u201d\n\nHis wife, Stephanie Bissland of Anchorage, and a sister acting as a family spokesperson in South Africa, both declined to comment until after the trial.\n\nThe trial, expected to last three to four weeks, was scheduled to begin Monday with jury selection.\n\nProsecutors had suggested the possibility of closing the courtroom to prevent the gruesome videos from being seen by the public. The Associated Press, the Anchorage Daily News, Alaska\u2019s News Source and Alaska Public Media objected to any such move in a letter to the court's presiding judge.\n\nAfterward, Saxby said he has no intention of keeping the public from the courtroom, but safeguards will be in place to prevent those in the gallery or watching the trial's livestream from seeing them."}

(AP) \u2014 The hallways of Bacone College are cold and dark. In the main hall, there are no lectures to be heard, only the steady hum of the space heater keeping the administrative offices warm.\n\nStudents aren't attending classes here this semester, but work still needs to be done. In the college\u2019s historic buildings, there are leaks to plug, mold to purge and priceless works of Native American art to save from ruin. Not to mention devising a plan to keep the college from shuttering for good. It\u2019s a daunting task for the nine remaining employees.\n\nBut on this rainy December morning, the college's president is running a DoorDash order. \u201cIf we have the money, we can pay,\u201d Interim President Nicky Michael said regarding salaries. Even she has to find a way to make ends meet.\n\nFounded in 1880 as a Baptist missionary college focused on assimilation, Bacone College transformed into an Indigenous-led institution that provided an intertribal community, as well as a degree. With the permission of the Muscogee Nation Tribal Council, Bacone's founders used a treaty right to establish the college at the confluence of three rivers, where tribal nations had been meeting for generations.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, the center of this was Bacone\u2019s Native American art program, which produced some of the most important Indigenous artists of their time, including Woody Crumbo, Fred Beaver, Joan Hill and Ruthe Blalock Jones.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nThey and their contemporaries pushed the boundaries of what was considered \u201cNative American art.\u201d During a period of intense hostility against tribal sovereignty by the U.S., Bacone became defined by the exchange of ideas its Native faculty and students created and represented a new opportunity for Indigenous education and academic thought.\n\n\u201cBacone was the only place in the world where that could happen for Native people,\u201d said Robin Mayes, a Cherokee and Muscogee man who attended Bacone in the \u201970s and taught silversmithing there in the \u201990s. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy to think that it\u2019s going to be discontinued.\u201d\n\nFor decades, the college has been plagued by poor financial choices and inconsistent leadership, triggering flashpoints between administration, students and staff over the mission and cultural direction of the college.\n\nSome have accused recent administrations of embezzlement, fraud and intimidation, resulting in multiple lawsuits. Students expressed frustration with a lack of resources and cultural competency among some school leaders. The college also has had trouble maintaining its accreditation.\n\nLast year, a lawsuit crippled Bacone's finances. Ultimately, Michael made the decision to suspend classes for the spring semester. She hopes the deferment is temporary, but if the college can't muster up millions of dollars, Oklahoma\u2019s oldest continually operating college likely will close its doors.\n\n\u201cIt has endured for over 140 years through terrible decisions,\u201d said Gerald Cournoyer, an instructor who was hired in 2019 to restart the college\u2019s art program.\n\n\u201cProviding oversight for Bacone has been a struggle because of the leadership or lack thereof,\u201d said Cournoyer, who also is a renowned Lakota artist. Some presidents focused time and money on athletic programs, others on Bacone's Baptist missionary roots. \u201cWhen you put absolutely no money, nothing, not $20, not $10, into your fundraising efforts, this is what you get.\u201d\n\nDuring the time Patti Jo King was the director of the Center for American Indians at Bacone from 2012 to 2018, leadership wanted to build a state-of-the-art museum to replace the 80-year-old building housing many priceless pieces of Native art.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t even have the money to keep it open seven days a week,\u201d said King, now a retired Cherokee professor, writer and academic.\n\nEven when she first arrived on campus, King said Bacone's financial debts already had caught up to it. The student dorms didn\u2019t have hot water, staff were severely underpaid and graduation rates among the college\u2019s remaining students were low.\n\nStill, she and other faculty endeavored to make it a place where Native students could find community, but Bacone\u2019s old problems never went away. Like Cournoyer, after years of working toward rebuilding, she left in frustration.\n\nToday, the old museum is empty. Its artifacts were moved to another location so they wouldn\u2019t be exposed to extreme temperatures.\n\nThe remaining staff act as caretakers of the historic stone buildings that predate Oklahoma, themselves important pieces of the past. In the museum, Ataloa Lodge, the fireplace is made of stones sent to the college from Indigenous communities across the country: one from the birthplace of Sequoyah, one from the grave of Sitting Bull, another from the field where Custer died. Five hundred in all, each stone a memory.\n\nMichael, the interim president, and others have been cleaning up buildings in hopes they might soon host graduation banquets and student gatherings. Other staff chase off looters. Rare paintings still hang across campus, including pieces by members of the Kiowa Six, who became internationally famous a century ago, and Johnnie Diacon, a Muscogee painter and alumnus whose work can be seen in the background of several episodes of the television show Reservation Dogs.\n\nA few years ago, experts from a museum in Tulsa warned that many of the paintings are contaminated with mold, which will spread to other nearby works of art. Leslie Hannah, a Cherokee educator who sits on the college\u2019s board of trustees, said he\u2019s concerned, but the cost of restoring them falls far down the list, behind broken gas lines, flooded basements and a mountain of debt.\n\nBacone\u2019s current financial crisis stems partially from a lawsuit brought by Midgley-Huber Energy Concepts, a Utah-based heating and air company that sued the college over more than $1 million in unpaid construction and service fees. Twice last year, the Muskogee County Sheriff\u2019s Office put Bacone\u2019s property up for sale to settle the debt. Both times the auction was called off, most recently in December.\n\nMHEC owner Chris Oberle told KOSU last month that he intended to purchase the historic property. Attorneys for MHEC have not returned repeated requests for comment from the Associated Press.\n\nAlumni have called the validity of any sale of the property into question, pointing to the treaty right that established the campus and its listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Attorneys for the college declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation.\n\nMichael said she doesn\u2019t know what stalled the auction, but she is grateful for more time to try to save Bacone.\n\nAcross the country, there are only a few dozen tribal colleges, according to the American Indian College Fund, a nonprofit that supports Native American access to higher education. Tribal colleges must be sponsored by a federally recognized tribe and have a majority Native student enrollment. But unlike most of those colleges, Bacone was built on its identity as an intertribal school, a quality that former staff and alumni say made it special.\n\nNow a private institution, Bacone no longer receives state or federal assistance. Its finances have long relied heavily on student tuition, and now it has no students. Michael said judging from the finances, it\u2019s a miracle the college managed to keep its doors open this long.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m looking back on this thinking this was set up for failure,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nGraham Lee Brewer is a member of AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

Nonetheless, about eight out of 10 of voters support Bukele, according to a January poll from the University of Central America. That's despite Bukele taking steps throughout his first term that lawyers and critics say chip away at the country's system of checks and balances.\n\nBut El Salvador's traditional parties from the left and right that created the vacuum that Bukele first filled in 2019 remain a shambles. Alternating in power for some three decades, the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and leftist Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front (FMLN) were thoroughly discredited by their own corruption and inefficacy. Their presidential candidates this year are polling in the low single digits.\n\nBukele, the self-described \u201cworld\u2019s coolest dictator,\u201d has gained fame for his brutal crackdown on gangs, in which more than 1% of the country\u2019s population has been arrested.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nWhile his administration is accused of committing widespread human rights abuses, violence has also plummeted, in a country known just a few years ago as one of the most dangerous in the world.\n\nBecause of that, voters like 55-year-old businesswoman Marleny Mena are willing to overlook concerns that Bukele has taken undemocratic steps to concentrate power.\n\nFormerly a street vendor in San Salvador's once gang-controlled downtown, Mena said she used to be scared to walk around the city, fearful she could accidentally cross from one gang's territory to another, with potentially serious consequences. Since Bukele began his crackdown, that fear has dissipated.\n\n\"He just needs a little bit more time, the time he needs to keep improving the country,\u201d Mena said.\n\nIn the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s vote, Bukele made no public campaign appearances. Instead, the populist plastered his social media and television screens across the country with a simple message recorded from his couch: If he and his New Ideas party didn\u2019t win elections this year, the \u201cwar with the gangs would be put at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe opposition will be able to achieve its true and only plan, to free the gang members and use them to return to power,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the 42-year-old Bukele and his party are increasingly looked to as a case study for a wider global rise in authoritarianism.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this growing rejection of the basic principles of democracy and human rights, and support for authoritarian populism among people who feel that, concepts like democracy and human rights and due process have failed them,\u201d said Tyler Mattiace, Americas researcher for Human Rights Watch."}

(AP) \u2014 Oregon lawmakers are set to convene Monday for the start of a short legislative session that is expected to be dominated by homelessness, a housing shortage and plans to overhaul the state\u2019s pioneering drug decriminalization law as overdose deaths surge.\n\nLawmakers will have just 35 days to pass bills. For now, legislative leaders have indicated that bipartisan lines of communication are open as they overcome any partisan tensions still lingering from last year\u2019s Republican walkout over measures related to abortion, transgender care and gun rights, which ground the Legislature to a halt for a record six weeks and disqualified 10 GOP state senators from reelection.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tina Kotek urged lawmakers to concentrate on the most state's most pressing issues.\n\n\u201cMy number-one focus for the legislative session is to put as much as possible into the effort to improve housing production in the state,\u201d Kotek said. \u201cThat is the ultimate solution to our housing and homelessness crisis.\u201d\n\nThe sole bill introduced by Kotek this session is a sweeping housing measure that would make changes to Oregon's hallmark land-use law to facilitate the construction of homes, among other things. In place since the 1970s, the law placed growth boundaries on cities in a bid to prevent urban sprawl and preserve farmland and forests.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nKotek\u2019s measure would grant cities a one-time exemption to the rule, allowing the addition of new land for housing in a so-called \u201curban growth boundary.\u201d It would require 30% of new units in expansion areas to be affordable housing.\n\nThe proposal would build on changes made to the land-use law last year, when lawmakers passed a bill to increase available land for semiconductor development. The bill allowed Kotek to designate up to eight sites for urban growth boundary expansion to be used for such purposes.\n\nKotek's roughly $500 million housing package this session also would include $20 million in grants she described as \u201cclimate-friendly\u201d incentives. The grants would be available for housing projects where cooking appliances, heating and water heaters are powered by electricity instead of natural gas.\n\nAnother top priority for the governor is expanding and increasing funding for summer learning programs in a bid to help students overcome learning losses largely stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe more heated debates this session are expected to revolve around proposed changes to the state's first-in-the-nation drug decriminalization law.\n\nFacing growing public and political pressure and one of the largest national spikes in overdose deaths, Democrats have unveiled a bill that would undo a key part of the law by once again making the possession of small amounts of drugs a low-level misdemeanor. The move would enable police to confiscate drugs and crack down on public use, its authors said.\n\nMeasure 110, approved by voters in 2020, directed the state\u2019s cannabis tax revenue toward drug addiction treatment while decriminalizing \u201cpersonal use\u201d amounts of illicit drugs. Possession of under a gram of heroin, for example, is only subject to a ticket and a maximum fine of $100.\n\nRepublicans say Democrats' proposal doesn't go far enough. They want \u201cpersonal use\u201d possession to be a higher-level misdemeanor and treatment to be mandatory.\n\nHouse leaders from both parties acknowledged there will be policy disagreements and said they were focused on building relationships and adopting a \u201cno surprises approach\u201d to avoid the communication breakdowns that contributed to last year\u2019s GOP walkout in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe have an agenda in front of us that we need to focus on,\u201d said House Minority Leader Jeff Helfrich, a Republican. \u201cIf the system breaks down and we don\u2019t produce for Oregonians, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nWhile Senate leaders did not tout their working relationships to the same extent, minority leader Tim Knopp, who led last year\u2019s walkout, said he has had \u201cpositive\u201d meetings with the chamber\u2019s Democratic president, Rob Wagner.\n\nWagner said he spent the interim period between sessions traveling across the state to visit Republican senators in their home districts and described having \u201cgood and open conversations\u201d with Knopp.\n\nKnopp is among the 10 GOP senators who have been disqualified from seeking reelection after last year\u2019s lengthy walkout. Under a voter-approved constitutional amendment aimed at stopping such boycotts, lawmakers with more than 10 unexcused absences cannot run for reelection. A group of GOP senators, including Knopp, had challenged their disqualification in a lawsuit that was rejected by the Oregon Supreme Court.\n\nThe high court ruling upheld an administrative rule implemented by the secretary of state's office last year stating that lawmakers with at least 10 unexcused absences could not seek office for the immediately following term.\n\nTaking another step to prevent walkouts, Democrats this session have introduced a joint resolution requiring a majority of lawmakers to be present for a quorum, rather than two-thirds.\n\nRepublicans' walkout strategy has been based on denying the two-thirds quorum needed for the House or Senate to conduct legislative business. If passed, the proposed constitutional amendment would be put to voters.\n\nKotek said she has been in contact with Republican leaders and isn't concerned about policy differences erupting as they did last session.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s focus on housing, let\u2019s focus on behavioral health, let\u2019s focus on summer learning,\u201d Kotek said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fancy session.

Forward Andrew Wiggins suffered what Kerr said was a left foot injury late in the first half and Jonathan Kuminga fouled out with 1:06 remaining in regulation. X-rays on Wiggins' foot were negative.\n\nKerr said Saric could join the team for its next game at Brooklyn.\n\nIt was tied at 89 entering the fourth period.

But the U.S. and its allies characterize them as indiscriminate and a menace to global trade.\n\nFaced with mounting Red Sea violence, major shipping lines have largely abandoned the critical trade route for longer routes around Africa. This has increased costs, feeding worries about global inflation while sapping Egypt of crucial foreign revenue from shippers sailing the Suez Canal to or from the Red Sea.\n\nBiden's emerging strategy on Yemen aims to weaken the Houthi militants but stops well short of trying to defeat the group or directly attack Iran, the Houthis' main sponsor, experts say.\n\nThe strategy blends limited military strikes and sanctions, and appears aimed at punishing the Houthis while attempting to limit the risk of a broad Middle East conflict.\n\nThe U.S. has carried out more than a dozen strikes against Houthi targets in the past several weeks, but these have failed to stop attacks by the group.\n\nSarea, the Houthi military spokesperson, suggested in a statement on social media that the group's intervention in the Red Sea would continue.\n\n\"These attacks will not deter us from our ethical, religious and humanitarian stance in support of the resilient Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,\" Sarea said.\n\nJust hours before the latest major wave of strikes from the sea and air, the U.S. military's Central Command issued statements detailing other, more limited strikes in the past day that included hitting six cruise missiles the Houthis were preparing to launch against ships in the Red Sea.\n\nAround 4 a.m. in Yemen (0100 GMT), the U.S. military also struck a Houthi anti-ship cruise missile that was poised to launch.\n\n\"This is not an escalation,\" said British Defence Minister Grant Shapps. \"We have already successfully targeted launchers and storage sites involved in Houthi attacks, and I am confident that our latest strikes have further degraded the Houthis\u2019 capabilities.\"\n\nThe United States said Sunday's strikes had support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand. U.S. Central Command said that beyond missile capabilities, the strikes targeted drone storage and operations sites, radars and helicopters.\n\nDespite the strikes against Iran-linked groups, the Pentagon has said it does not want war with Iran and does not believe Tehran wants war either. U.S. Republicans have been ratcheting up pressure on President Joe Biden, a Democrat, to deal a blow to Iran directly.\n\nIt was unclear how Tehran would respond to the strikes, which do not directly target Iran but degrade groups it backs.\n\nIran's foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement the attacks in Iraq and Syria represented \"another adventurous and strategic mistake by the United States that will result only in increased tension and instability\".\n\nIraq summoned the U.S. charge d'affaires in Baghdad to deliver a formal protest after strikes in that country.\n\nThe Houthi military said in its statement that the United States and Britain carried out a total of 48 airstrikes on Yemen, with 13 of them in the capital Sanaa and Sanaa Governorate. Another 11 strikes were on Taiz Governorate and nine were on Hodeidah Governorate.\n\n(Reporting by Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali; additional reporting by Mohammed Ghobari in Aden, Hatem Maher and Ahmed Tolba in Cairo and Akanksha Khushi in Bengaluru; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, David Gregorio and William Mallard)"}

And for us, you can\u2019t really build programs and a culture because everybody leaves.\"\n\nPitino, who won national championships at Kentucky in 1996 and Louisville in 2013, has had his own history of run-ins with the NCAA.\n\nThe title at Louisville was vacated for NCAA violations, and another NCAA case related to the FBI\u2019s investigation into corruption in college basketball recruiting led to him being fired by Louisville in 2017.\n\nThe final ruling from the NCAA\u2019s outside enforcement arm on the FBI case came down in November 2022 and exonerated Pitino.\n\nAfter leaving Iona last March to take the St. John's job, Pitino brought in 12 new players for this season \u2014 including 10 transfers.

His primary challengers, Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, were far behind.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign, and set us on the path to winning the Presidency,\u201d Biden said in a statement after his early-evening win. \u201c Now in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the Presidency again \u2013 and making Donald Trump a loser \u2013 again.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina's primary was the first official nominating contest for Democrats, who \u2013 egged on by Biden \u2013 moved the state up in the primary schedule. The shift was meant to give more power to a state with a higher percentage of Black voters, a key part of the Democratic base and the voter group that gave Biden his victory there in 2020.\n\nFour years ago, Biden's campaign was flagging. Having placed fourth in the Iowa caucuses, and fifth in New Hampshire, Biden appeared headed towards an early exit from the presidential campaign. But buoyed by Black voters \u2013 especially Black women \u2013 Biden earned nearly half of the primary vote in South Carolina in a five-way race, propelling him ultimately to the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe win is a welcome boost for the beleaguered candidate, whose approval ratings are in the high 30s or low 40s, and is facing what is shaping up as a close race against Trump, currently his party's front-runner for the nomination.\n\nDespite the expected primary victory in South Carolina, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris made a concerted effort to campaign there, visiting the Palmetto State the last two weekends. Biden spoke last month at Mother Emanuel AME church, where a white supremacist murdered nine people in 2015. Harris also visited South Carolina three times since the beginning of the year, speaking at college campuses about student debt relief and abortion rights.\n\nDemocrats have been concerned about polling that shows a retrenchment in Black support, with the reliably Democratic voters group disappointed in what Biden has been able to achieve. That has been a source of frustration for Biden operatives, who note that the president has appointed record numbers of Black people to judicial posts and presided over low Black unemployment.\n\n\n\nBest Cartoons on the 2024 Election View All 125 Images\n\nBut early voting in South Carolina suggested that the narrative on an unenthusiastic Democratic base and disenchanted Black voters is untrue, Jay Parmley, executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party, told reporters Saturday afternoon.\n\nNearly 52,000 people cast early ballots this year \u2013 fewer than the 77,000 who did so in 2020 but still a very strong showing given that a Biden victory was all but assured, Parmley said. Further, 76.5% of the early vote was made up of Black voters, 13% higher than in 2020, he added.\n\n\"We were picked to go first because our voters give a damn,\" Parmley said. \"Our voters are enthusiastic and energized.\" The party held 150 events in their \"we go first\" bus tour and made 675,442 phone calls to voters, party officials said.\n\n\u201cIn an uncompetitive early vote ... we have seen a very solid early vote. I\u2019ll take this number any day of the week,\u201d Parmley said.\n\nSouth Carolinians had the choice of voting in either the Democratic or Republican presidential primary, but not both. Supporters of GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley sent text messages to voters urging them to eschew the Democratic nominating contest for the Feb. 24 GOP primary, when their votes could help the former South Carolina governor beat former President Donald Trump there. It\u2019s unclear how many Democrats or independent voters decided to save their votes for the GOP primary.\n\nBiden also handily won the New Hampshire primary as a write-in candidate with 64% of the vote \u2013 despite not campaigning in the Granite State or running any ads there. Phillips, who made a big effort in New Hampshire, got less than 20% of the vote.\n\nSince New Hampshire bucked Democratic National Committee rules, holding its primary Jan. 24 despite the fact that South Carolina had been given the role of first primary in the nation, no delegates from that contest will be awarded at the Democratic National Convention. But the win was good optics for Biden.\n\nAt a visit to his Delaware campaign headquarters Saturday, Biden said the contrast between him and Trump would become more clear as the November election gets closer.\n\n\u201cFolks are starting to focus in,\u201d he said, citing a Quinnipiac University national poll showing him leading Trump by 6 percentage points as well as two Pennsylvania polls showing him ahead in the Keystone State."}

It is a fitting close to a year in which women have topped the charts and shone on the concert stage. And it is set to continue, with Adele announcing pop-up gig dates in Germany that go on sale this week.\n\nBut a rather contrasting picture was painted by coverage of fresh evidence of the struggle women still fact to be taken seriously within the industry. So while the Grammys are worth saluting, a quick look at the rest of the contenders tellingly reveals that no woman is nominated for (non-classical) producer of the year. It is a problem detailed by the hard-hitting Westminster report released last week into misogyny in the music business by the women and equalities committee. According to the cross-party group of MPs, the industry is still a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d, where abuse and harassment remain common. It is an \u201cendemic\u201d problem, the report concluded, and only an urgent plan of action can counter it.\n\nThe industry\u2019s track record is offputting, of course, with tales of abuse and manipulation rife before and after Tina Turner finally got away from Ike. If domineering husbands and unscrupulous male managers were not calling the shots, then male producers and record executives usually were.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a time when the incredible marketability of talented women has not been recognised,\u201d said former music executive Mike Smith, who has worked at the top of major labels and publishers since the 1990s. \u201cI just hope that now they\u2019re getting a bit more control of their destinies, instead of being puppets of a male business.\u201d\n\nThe statistics are a cause for optimism, Smith concedes: \u201cThere\u2019s never been a better time for a woman in the music industry, but we are starting from a spectacularly low bar.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Phoebe Bridgers of all-female supergroup Boygenius. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\nThe chief executive of industry body the BPI, Jo Twist, and its chair, YolanDa Brown, responded to the \u201cunacceptable\u201d misogyny described in the MPs\u2019 report with a little optimism too, saying in a joint statement: \u201cAs the committee acknowledges, record companies have increased representation of women in executive positions, and we\u2019re seeing more women, as artists and in their teams, achieve success.\u201d\n\nSo the Grammys will be an appropriately high note amid new statistics that detail music trends last year on both sides of the Atlantic. The BPI revealed that for the first time women spent 31 weeks at the top of the singles chart in Britain. What is more, they had a record-breaking seven of the year\u2019s 10 biggest-selling singles, which amounts to more than half of the overall top 20. Even more striking perhaps is that almost half (48.5%) of all the songs that made the Top 10 this year came from women \u2013 working either as solo artists or in collaborations. These numbers represent the highest annual share of hits for women this century.\n\nLeading the conquering heroines was Miley Cyrus, who had 10 weeks at No 1 with her single Flowers. But up there beside her, also taking the top spot in 2023, were Dua Lipa, Ellie Goulding, Kenya Grace, Raye, Billie Eilish, Doja Cat, Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift. And when put together with Raye, SZA, PinkPantheress and the Cameroonian-American singer Libianca, Cyrus, Swift and Goulding have made more music business history by being jointly responsible for seven of the year\u2019s 10 most popular tracks in the UK \u2013 the biggest share in more than 70 years of the Official Singles Chart.\n\nThe truth though, it seems, is that while an elite group of female artists is gaining greater stature and confidence in the industry, the story is not repeated at either the very bottom or the very top of the business. Female recording studio technicians and session musicians still have harrowing accounts of the obstacles and insults they have faced at work, while the most influential labels and music publishing companies are top-heavy with men.\n\nAn oppressive emphasis on the physical appearance of female artists made their life particularly hard, the parliamentary committee report found, analysing evidence gathered by a parliamentary inquiry that began last summer.\n\nLimited opportunities to advance in the industry and persistently lower levels of pay are also hurdles, while racial discrimination holds back many black women from taking up influential roles in the music business, the findings suggested.\n\nView image in fullscreen Potential figurehead? Kylie Minogue. Photograph: David Fisher/Shutterstock for Global\n\nMost worrying was testimony about an enduring \u201cculture of silence\u201d that means women are often expected to sit next to known abusers at industry events. The only alternative is a potentially career-ending showdown. \u201cMuch of the evidence we received has had to remain confidential, including commentary on television shows and household names,\u201d the report read. \u201cThat is highly regrettable but demonstrates the extent of the use of NDAs [non-disclosure agreements].\u201d\n\nGoulding is one of the prominent performers to use her secure position to speak out. Explaining the unpleasant environment that female artists can encounter, she recalled \u201ca slight feeling of discomfort\u201d whenever she walked into a studio to find she was alone with \u201cone or two men\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are still few women in really powerful positions in the record companies, considering at least half the consumers of music are women,\u201d said Smith, \u201cThere used to be a teaboy route up through to the top of a record company, but if you were a 17-year-old girl, would you really want to be there with no status and all that male banter? It\u2019s good that the music schools are now training women for these roles, because it would be hard for a young woman to put up with all that male stupidity. You can see why so many of them say \u2018I\u2019m out.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Smith, who has worked with artists such as PJ Harvey, Elastica, Beth Orton and Iggy Azalea, sees grounds for hope. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to say there is a bit more control for women performers now though. When it comes to dance, DJs and producers, they\u2019re really breaking through to become central players.\u201d\n\nAnd the numbers don\u2019t lie. There has been a huge surge up the charts. In 2022 only two female musicians cracked the top 10 of biggest songs, with Kate Bush reprising the success of her 1985 single Running Up That Hill, on the back of television\u2019s Stranger Things, and pop singer Cat Burns making an impact with Go.\n\nIt is the same heartening story in America. A study by the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that the share of women involved in last year\u2019s hits in the US had increased to 35%. The number of female artists has reached the highest since 2012.\n\n\u201cWhilst work continues towards achieving full representation for women across the music industry, 2023 has been a brilliant year for women in the Official Charts,\u201d said the BPI\u2019s Twist. \u201cThere is a more diverse range of recording artists than ever achieving great success with the backing of their labels. This should be celebrated, but without complacency, and our work in the music industry continues to ensure that this becomes the norm.\u201d\n\nThe unlikely industry figurehead should arguably now be the diminutive form of Kylie Minogue, a true stalwart. Last autumn she became the first woman to top the album chart in five consecutive decades. When her 15th studio album, Disco, reached No 1, she could look back at chart-topping run that began in 1988 with her debut album, Kylie."}

For children in year six, who had been given free school meals for their entire time in primary school, there was a 5-8% reduction.\n\nThe study, by the Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex, found that apart from the cost of living help to parents, there was an associated increase in reading. It suggested that by the age of 11, the impact was equivalent to \u201capproximately two weeks\u2019 additional progress in school\u201d.\n\nIt also found that making free school meals universal also increased their take-up by those who had already been entitled to them by 8%, possibly because it changed school culture and the stigma around having them. It appeared to lead to one in three children eating a school lunch for the first time.\n\nIn England, all reception, year one and year two children are entitled to free lunches. Blanket free school meals have now been rolled out by London mayor Sadiq Khan across the capital until next year. All primary school children in Wales and Scotland are due to receive free school meals from this year. Offering free meals to all state primary school pupils would cost about \u00a31bn a year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nA series of Labour MPs called for the national rollout of free meals. Stephen Timms, the Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said the policy was in place and working within his London borough. \u201cThe policy has been hugely popular among parents, and the research now shows that it is making a real difference to children\u2019s health and learning,\u201d he said. \u201cI welcome the decision by the mayor of London to extend the policy London-wide. It should be rolled out nationally, too.\u201d\n\nKim Johnson, the Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, said that in her city, an average of 11 children in a class of 30 live in poverty. \u201cAccess to healthy, nutritious food is a necessity for children to thrive,\u201d she said. \u201cI have long supported the NEU\u2019s No Child Left Behind campaign to roll out universal free school meals to all primary and secondary pupils ... to ensure that hunger doesn\u2019t prevent children from learning, from reaching their full potential.\u201d\n\nSharon Hodgson, chair of the all-party group on school food, said ministers had had evidence since 2013 on the benefits of such a scheme. \u201cUniversalism breaks the stigma of means-tested free school meals and breaks the cycle of inequalities that exist outside the school gates being reproduced in the dining hall,\u201d she said. \u201cSchool food is the best public health policy we have at our disposal. With it we have the opportunity to reach every child in the UK with hot, healthy, nutritious meals. That is why I have been calling for universal free school meals for over 14 years.\u201d\n\nKhan said he had \u201cpersonal experience\u201d of the difference free school meals can make. \u201cDelivering these meals to all state primary schoolchildren in London has been one of my proudest moments as mayor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt has been fantastic to hear from teachers about how much better pupils are performing this year and also how much families have benefited, with parents not having to worry about how to feed their children. As this study shows, providing all children with the offer of a nutritious meal during the school day helps to improve health and enable pupils to focus on their schoolwork, rather than worry about being hungry.\u201d\n\nBridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, has pledged to have breakfast clubs in every primary school, funded from the abolition of non-dom tax status. However, the party has no plans to expand free school lunches.\n\nResearchers examined the impact of expanding the policy to all primary school children by studying four London boroughs \u2013 Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Newham and Islington \u2013 which have their own schemes. \u201cThere are lots of long-term benefits that we\u2019d expect, such as an improvement in reading ability, even at the end of primary school,\u201d said Dr Angus Holford, the study\u2019s co-author. \u201cOther evidence suggests this will persist into a benefit in lifetime earnings. Even if these effects on obesity prevalence don\u2019t fully persist into adulthood, even delaying the onset of obesity, or reducing your total lifetime duration of obesity, still reduces the risk of developing later diseases.\u201d"}

The brick facades of the row of houses in Baltimore, Maryland, picked out by Power\u2019s large format camera, also gesture towards that Delft hyper-realism \u2013 and the implied social questions in the image echo across centuries and continents.\n\nLike the Dutch painter, Power invites you to look hard at each brick, window and railing in his frame.

This picture comes from the fourth volume of the British photographer\u2019s ongoing project Good Morning, America, which began with Barack Obama\u2019s second term in 2012 and has taken in the existential uncertainties of the Trump years. His method seems in the tradition of the \u201csurvey\u201d photographic quests that depicted the American landscape in pioneering prospectuses for railroads and westerly migration in the mid-19th century, but in many ways his photographs offer a before and after to those vistas: the scale and grandeur remain but those ambitions are undone in the detail of how things have worked out. Walking through left-behind districts such as this one or getting a vantage on rust-belt factories and drive-throughs and housing projects, his pictures give a constant feel of time arrested; and of the need for proper attention, in every sense."}

You only need look around to see all the steam coming out of people\u2019s ears\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, Ostermeier is a German director well-known in Europe for his \u201ccanon-mauling\u201d aesthetic when it comes to the classics. Since the late 90s, when he was a w\u00fcnderkind who believed those over the age of 40 had no business running theatres, Ostermeier has been merrily applying his form of \u201ccapitalist realism\u201d to major playwrights, reimagining the work in ways that have brought him acclaim throughout the world. But while he has toured plays to the UK before \u2013 in 2014, a German production of An Enemy of the People played at the Barbican \u2013 this is the first time he has worked with a British cast, a fact that Smith rather sweetly believes may have helped him to land the role of Thomas Stockmann, the medical officer of a small-town spa who discovers its water is contaminated and goes on to make one of theatre\u2019s more notable political speeches, an attack on the liberal majority and its vexed relationship with the truth.\n\nView image in fullscreen As a young footballer. Photograph: Courtesy Matt Smith\n\n\u201cI got an email, as you do,\u201d says Smith. \u201cTuesday afternoon, or whatever. Ah, a play. That\u2019d be interesting. Ah, Ibsen. That would be cool. And then: Thomas Ostermeier, do you want to meet him? I was like, excuse my language, fucking yes, yes I do! I\u2019d been a big fan of his for years. I\u2019d seen his Richard III, and I knew of his relationship with Lars Eidinger, an actor he has collaborated with for years. So we had lunch together, at one of my favourite restaurants, and I was just really struck\u2026 He\u2019s sort of impressive. I\u2019d always thought that if he ever did work in London, I\u2019d check in and go and see it, because that\u2019s the kind of theatre I want to be engaged with: the stuff that tries to push things to the edge of\u2026 everywhere. I mean, what he has done at the Schaub\u00fchne [a theatre in Berlin]\u2026 the culture he has developed there!\n\n\u201cAnyway, I was in luck. I\u2019m not sure \u2013 I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll mind me saying this \u2013 that Thomas had a great knowledge of English actors or their work. But he had watched The Crown [the Netflix series in which Smith played \u2013 brilliantly \u2013 Prince Philip for its first two seasons], and he\u2019d enjoyed it. What was interesting about the meeting, though, was that we got discussion of the play out of the way quite quickly, and then we talked about life and everything else. We both love Brazil, so we talked about that. And then I did that thing afterwards where I phoned my agent and I said pretty much there and then that I was in, because I think that\u2019s what you should do if you\u2019re lucky enough to get in a room with someone you really want to work with.\u201d Crikey. But didn\u2019t Smith always used to insist he was a terrible ditherer? I read somewhere that even after he\u2019d accepted the part of the Doctor in Doctor Who, a role that would change his life, he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d done the right thing. \u201cWell, I\u2019m trying,\u201d he says, a touch of No\u00ebl Coward in his voice. \u201cOne hopes to evolve as one hits seniority, on whose middle-aged door I am now knocking.\u201d (For the record, he\u2019s 41.)\n\nView image in fullscreen Smith as the Doctor and Karen Gillan as Amy Pond in Doctor Who, 2012. Photograph: BBC\n\nOstermeier\u2019s An Enemy of the People has a modern setting, and comes with a paint fight and a performance of David Bowie\u2019s Changes (Smith\u2019s character is in a band, who rehearse on stage). The director is also retaining the big moment, seen in productions elsewhere, when Stockmann\u2019s opponents ask the audience for a show of hands \u2013 is he right or wrong, politically speaking? \u2013 before inviting them to pose any questions they have. Smith goes on: \u201cWhat grabbed me about Stockmann is the idea of playing someone who\u2019s on the right side, saying the right thing and fighting for the truth, but who is ultimately like a star turning into a black hole, enveloping himself in his own ego and velocity and opinions. And then, for people to be able to put up their hand and say: I think you\u2019re like this, and the world out there is like that\u2026 They\u2019ll actually be able to talk to him.\u201d Won\u2019t that be terrifying? Such jeopardy, it seems, is half of the point. \u201cI hope people do ask questions. It\u2019s such a volatile time. You only need look around to see all the steam coming out of people\u2019s ears, and the theatre has always been a space historically, almost like a church, where a person can go: look, I feel like this. I\u2019m genuinely interested to know where the audience feels the morality of the play lies.\u201d\n\nWhy do actors with TV or film careers return to the theatre? Week one is doubtless thrilling, but what about week seven? And the pay, my dears!\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI was talking about this, as one does, to the wonderful actor Freddie Fox, who is not only astoundingly beautiful but also a creature of the theatre, and he said: \u2018Well, darling, you know, it\u2019s where one sharpens one\u2019s tool.\u2019\u201d We hoot at the innuendo, and then he says: \u201cBut he\u2019s right, of course. What you say about it being repetitive, that\u2019s one way of looking at it. But Lindsay Duncan, another wonderful actor I did a play with, said to me it\u2019s about being consistent and developing, and that\u2026 robustness.\u201d The challenge is what he relishes \u2013 that and, in this instance, a change of pace from the Games of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon, the second series of which he shot last year (Smith plays Prince Daemon, in a wig that makes him look, as I said when I reviewed it, like he\u2019s on tour with Sigue Sigue Sputnik).\n\nView image in fullscreen With Claire Foy in series one of The Crown. Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy\n\nBut theatre isn\u2019t without its anxieties. Like many actors, he is concerned about the ability of the audience to focus. How distracted people are. \u201cI\u2019m not a guy who would even take sweets into a cinema,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo, yeah, I do worry about noise. But I think there\u2019s a cultural thing where at home we watch a movie or The Traitors or whatever, and at the same time, we\u2019re also doing this\u2026\u201d He mimes scrolling a mobile phone. \u201cSurely to God we can concentrate and suspend our disbelief for two hours \u2013 if it\u2019s an interesting enough play, and part of that is up to us, keeping people interested.\u201d He hopes a younger audience will be drawn to An Enemy of the People. Post-Covid and in the midst of a cost of living crisis, its message about the dangers of privileging economics over community are more relevant than ever. But he also worries that some simply won\u2019t be able to afford it. \u201cI hope we\u2019re not pricing young people out,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, the theatre is so much money, for all of us. You sort of go: I could fly to Milan or Amsterdam [for that].\u201d His eyes (round and deep-set, they make me think of a couple of Maltesers) suddenly widen. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say: don\u2019t come. Please do come. But it is true.\u201d He smiles. At moments like these, promoting a play is almost as much of a high-wire act as performing in one.\n\nSmith was not destined to be an actor. Football was his thing. He was born and grew up in Northampton, where his dad ran a plastics company, and his mum worked in promotions (he has an older sister, who trained as a dancer). He was, by his own account, a hyperactive child \u2013 an energy he maintains to this day \u2013 but also a determined, hard-working one. He played for the youth team of Leicester City (he was captain), and loved every minute: the early starts, the muddy pitches, all of it. But then, catastrophe. He developed spondylolysis, a kind of stress fracture. Suddenly, he could no longer play.\n\nMy dad was from the north, and hugely loving, but there was a toughness in his love, which I feel really grateful for\n\nIs this still the case? Are there five-a-side games with his mates nowadays?\n\n\u201cI wish! But no, my body won\u2019t facilitate that. I\u2019m just an avid consumer [of football] now. My team \u2013 we\u2019re having a bit of a nightmare at the moment \u2013 is Blackburn, like my dad\u2019s. God bless him [his father died in 2021], I remember how he refused to buy the papers if Blackburn had lost, and how it would ruin the next hour of a Saturday afternoon when they did. I build my whole weekend around football \u2013 the game, and then Match of the Day \u2013 and I\u2019m such a fan of England. I went to Russia [for the World Cup], and I watched all of the Euros.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen As Patrick Bateman in American Psycho at the Almeida theatre in 2013. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nLooking back, what he learned on the pitch stood him in good stead for acting. \u201cI think my dad instilled hard work in me: you know, the idea that you should always work harder than the person next to you in a team. He was from the north, and hugely loving, but there was a toughness in his love, which I feel really grateful for. I am hard-working, but I\u2019m also better with structure in my life. That\u2019s a good environment for me.\u201d Home grounds him, even now: he still has mates from those days. \u201cYeah, my two best friends, Alex and Nick. We lived in the same street as children. They\u2019ve been very important to me in my life. Especially when you get a job like Doctor Who, which thrusts you overnight into a completely different atmosphere. It\u2019s quite discombobulating. Suddenly, people recognise you.\u201d When Doctor Who came along \u2013 he was in the role from 2010 to 2014 \u2013 they were prepared to take the piss out of him \u201cconsistently\u201d. But they also supported him (they are not actors). \u201cThey come to see everything I\u2019m in, and they\u2019re really honest.\u201d One of them saw him in American Psycho, a musical adapted from Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s novel that opened at the Almeida theatre in London in 2013. \u201cI said to him: \u2018What did you think, mate? How was my singing?\u2019 And he was, like: \u2018Yeah, everyone else was better at singing.\u2019\u201d I vaguely nod my head \u2013 I saw it, too \u2013 and he shouts: \u201cDon\u2019t agree with him!\u201d\n\nI did my dissertation and exams in a week. It\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve ever drunk coffee\n\nA drama teacher, Terry Hardingham, encouraged him to act, though at first he was reluctant. (This might have been because, as a younger boy, he\u2019d suffered from a stutter, one he eventually cured with hypnosis.) \u201cI was a footballer. That was not for me.\u201d But the teacher persisted, and Smith caught the bug. In the last year of school, he joined the National Youth Theatre, \u201ca wonderful thing for young actors\u201d. At the University of East Anglia, he kept up with it, and through it, he got his agents, and through them, an audition (successful) at the Royal Court. His university tutors weren\u2019t happy, but he did the job anyway, which is how the playwright Simon Stephens, who saw it, came to cast him in On the Shore of the Wide World at the Royal Exchange in Manchester (the cast included Siobhan Finneran). \u201cI was doing creative writing and drama at university, and I was in my final year, so at the same time I was writing 12 final poems and a story. I went back and did my dissertation and exams in a week. It\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve ever drunk coffee.\u201d\n\nDidn\u2019t his parents want him to have a proper job?\n\nView image in fullscreen As Prince Daemon Targaryen in House of the Dragon. Photograph: HBO\n\n\u201cYou know, the element of risk didn\u2019t bother them. What I\u2019m so grateful for is that on some level, conscious or not, they had faith in me.\u201d He misses his father painfully. \u201cI miss the company,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was so\u2026 you know. I miss that older male. We were so close. My friend Nick lost his dad at 21, and he said to me, you know, the next two years are going to be a blur, and looking back, they sort of have been.\u201d We talk about the business of losing a parent. \u201c[At the time], it doesn\u2019t feel like the horrible bits are really happening. It\u2019s a stasis of anxiety and stillness, but your feet are moving and your arms are moving, and you\u2019re just wallowing in this sort of\u2026 murk. Praying and hoping and waiting.\u201d\n\nWhat about his mum? \u201cOh, I have a good laugh with my mum. She\u2019s doing well. She had a tough time after my dad. It\u2019s very destabilising when you lose the\u2026 he was sort of the centrepiece. But she\u2019s out there now, grabbing life. I\u2019m proud of her, and she\u2019s hilarious.\u201d Will she be there on the first night of An Enemy of the People? He gives me wry look, pursing his lips comically. \u201cNo. She will be on a cruise. She will be in Fiji.\u201d He laughs fondly. When\u2019s he going to settle down? \u201cOh, my mum asks me that every day. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019m in no rush at the moment.\u201d He won\u2019t tell me if he\u2019s single or not (I don\u2019t really blame him), but the \u201canchor\u201d of his life is his Irish terrier, Bobby. \u201cDogs are a wonderful thing.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen With his mother, Lynne. Photograph: Dave Benett/WireImage\n\nAfter An Enemy of the People, he will begin shooting a TV adaptation of Nick Cave\u2019s 2009 novel, The Death of Bunny Munro; he will play the titular Lothario, a womaniser and alcoholic. \u201cIt\u2019s out of the frying pan and into the fire\u2026 I\u2019ve only met Nick Cave once, but I think he said [about the adaptation]: \u2018Finally, someone has had the balls to tell this unholy tale.\u2019 Bunny Munro is a character who it\u2019s near impossible to get on board with. I was in America recently, and I met a woman who said: \u2018I work with people who are really, really bad people, in prisons basically \u2013 and there is not a man on Earth I despise more than him [Munro].\u2019\u201d\n\nHe wants to \u201cre-evaluate\u201d his work ethic. \u201cI want to get back to the frame of mind I had when I was younger, when the level of focus was pretty laser.\u201d The bigger the challenge, the more likely this is to happen. Fame doesn\u2019t really interest him. It opens doors, but in the end, as he puts it, \u201cyou can only be your Hamlet\u201d. Worrying about what your peers are doing \u2013 who\u2019s up, who\u2019s down \u2013 won\u2019t get you anywhere. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in trying to commit to keeping things as everyday as possible. I had a nice talk with the cab driver on the way here. \u2018What are you up to?\u2019 he asked. I was listening to Talk Radio. I said: \u2019What do you mean? I\u2019m off to work.\u2019 And he said: \u2018I know that, but what are you doing?\u2019 I was, like: \u2019Oh, sorry mate, of course\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nPeople are starting to arrive for rehearsal; there is bustle outside, the sound of a spell being broken. I don\u2019t know why \u2013 this isn\u2019t the kind of thing I usually do \u2013 but in the last minutes before he has his photograph taken, I ask him to tell one bizarre thing about himself that no one knows. He thinks for a minute, hesitates slightly, and then he says: \u201cI have to touch something red every time I see a Royal Mail van.\u201d Blimey. How long has this being going on? \u201cTwenty years \u2013 and there are a lot of Royal Mail vans.\u201d I tell him he should save himself the trouble, and carry something red with him all the time, but I get the impression he thinks this might be cheating \u2013 and then he leaps up, insists on a selfie, and disappears, leaving me to ponder the fact that, if the Royal Mail does ever reduce its service to three days a week, there is at least one customer who might be quite relieved."}

He was 82.\n\nFirst elected president in 2014, Geingob was Namibia\u2019s longest serving prime minister and third president. Namibia is to hold presidential and national assembly elections towards the end of the year.\n\nGeingob, who was serving his second term as president, revealed in January that he was receiving treatment for cancer.\n\nA biopsy after a routine medical check-up in January had revealed \u201ccancerous cells\u201d, Geingob\u2019s office said at the time.\n\n\u201cIt is with utmost sadness and regret that I inform you that our beloved Dr Hage G Geingob, the president of the republic of Namibia has passed on today,\u201d said a statement on Sunday from the acting president, Nangolo Mbumba.\n\n\u201cAt his side, was his dear wife Madame Monica Geingos and his children.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Geingob underwent brain surgery, and in 2023 he underwent an aortic operation in neighbouring South Africa.\n\nUp until his death, he had been receiving treatment at Lady Pohamba hospital in Windhoek.\n\n\u201cThe Namibian nation has lost a distinguished servant of the people, a liberation struggle icon, the chief architect of our constitution and the pillar of the Namibian house,\u201d said Mbumba.\n\n\u201cAt this moment of deepest sorrow, I appeal to the nation to remain calm and collected while the Government attends to all necessary state arrangements, preparations and other protocols.\u201d\n\nHe said the cabinet would convene immediately to make the necessary state arrangements.\n\nBorn in a village in northern Namibia in 1941, Geingob was its first president outside the Ovambo ethnic group, which makes up more than half of the country\u2019s population.\n\nHe took up activism against South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime, which at the time ruled over Namibia, from his early schooling years before being driven into exile.\n\nHe spent almost three decades in Botswana and the US, leaving the former for the latter in 1964.\n\nWhile in the US, he remained a vocal advocate for Namibia\u2019s independence, representing the local liberation movement, Swapo, now the ruling party, at the UN and across the Americas.\n\nWhen Swapo won the first elections in 1990, Geingob was appointed prime minister \u2013 a position he held for 12 years before returning to it again in 2012.\n\nIn 2014, as the party comfortably won yet another vote, riding on the legacy of its role in the liberation struggle, Geingob became president.\n\nIn between top jobs, the composed yet stern-talking leader, who sported wide-rimmed glasses and a tuft of grey hair on his chin, held various ministerial and internal party positions.\n\nHis first term as president was tainted by a recession, high unemployment and graft allegations.\n\nIn 2019, documents published by WikiLeaks suggested that government officials took bribes from an Icelandic firm in exchange for continued access to Namibia\u2019s fishing grounds.\n\nThe \u201cfish rot\u201d scandal threatened Geingob\u2019s prospects of a second term, with the head of state also coming under fire for pumping money into a bloated administration and granting contracts to foreign rather than local companies.\n\nHis share of the vote dropped considerably in 2019 from the 2014 height of 87%, but he was still able to comfortably sail to victory with 56% of preferences.\n\nHe suffered a couple of health scares in his later years, having undergone brain surgery in 2013 and heart valve surgery in South Africa in June 2023.\n\nAn avid football fan, he played as a young man, which earned him the nickname Danger Point.\n\nHe was married three times, in 1967, 1993 and again in 2015 and had as many children."}

So I don\u2019t know where their increases come from.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI do remember years ago a chap, I think he was Kuwaiti or Saudi, just knocked on the door and bought a couple of buckets full of honey. I imagine he put it in his hand luggage.\u201d\n\nPeople in the UK honey business seem focused on other issues. Of all the honey that is consumed in the UK, it is a worry that less than 10% is produced here, Barton said, with cheap Chinese imports making up the stiffest competition.\n\nAs far as Brexit is concerned, a big issue is not so much exporting the end product to Saudi or anywhere else but importing queen bees, and on that, Brexit is proving more of a problem than a help.\n\nQueens are reared in southern European countries and brought to the UK so that farmers can begin their hives earlier in the season. But Brexit red tape means the bees are now subject to expensive and disruptive veterinary checks.\n\nAs for the government\u2019s claim that \u201ca barrier resolution worth \u00a3550m to UK businesses over five years\u201d has helped British beauty companies export to China, the barrier in question had nothing to do with Brexit, according to industry experts. In 2021, China relaxed rules on animal testing, which had been a big red line for UK manufacturers, making it easier to sell into their market.\n\nMillie Kendall, chair of the British Beauty Council, said the loss of trade with the EU outweighed the gains by a long way. \u201cWhat we really want is to sell to Europe and the US. Economically, we\u2019ve lost \u00a3853m in exports to the EU. Sixty-five per cent of our exports go to Europe \u2013 \u00a3550m sounds nice but it\u2019s not even what we\u2019ve lost.\u201d\n\nOne of Kendall\u2019s members sent some products to Spain in August and they have still not arrived. Another, larger company has had to build a \u00a31m warehouse in the EU simply to be able to distribute products. Most smaller companies have just given up, she said.\n\nFor larger sectors, Badenoch\u2019s triumphs seemed trivial, experts said. The business secretary\u2019s announcement said officials had unlocked \u00a325m of exports for medicines and \u00a317m of new business in Colombia.\n\n\u201cTogether, these amounts represent less than 1% of the total value of the UK pharmaceutical exports of goods in 2022,\u201d said Dr Jennifer Casta\u00f1eda-Navarrete, a senior policy analyst at Cambridge Industrial Innovation Policy, based at Cambridge University\u2019s Institute for Manufacturing.\n\nIn 2022, 46% of pharmaceutical exports went to the EU. She warned that Britain\u2019s previously thriving pharmaceutical sector was now in a trade deficit because we have to import so much more medicine than before \u2013 the latest 2022 figures show a $5bn deficit globally, compared with a surplus of $9.7bn in 2010.\n\nA business department spokesperson said: \u201cMany, including the Observer, forecast dire predictions for the UK economy after Brexit. As this document shows, those forecasts have been proven completely false. Of course there have been issues, nobody ever said it will all be perfect.\n\n\u201cHowever, the report uses official statistics and many of the things people claim are down to Brexit are really down to Covid and supply chain issues. This report is intended as a useful corrective to the consistent doom and gloom about Brexit.\u201d\n\nBut the business department\u2019s press release makes no mention of the problems suffered by small UK companies, which have seen their export markets hit and in many cases wiped out. In 2022, researchers at Aston University estimated that 42% of British products previously exported to the EU had disappeared from shops there.\n\nWhile large companies have been able to spend money on warehouses, vets, distributors, customs clearance, extra shipping costs and all the other red tape that arrived with Brexit, smaller ones have not.\n\nThomas Sampson, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, said the top 15% of companies had not seen a drop in exports to the EU, but for smaller businesses, there had been a 20% fall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that the DBT are working on removing market access barriers. But it\u2019s all a little bit marginal relative to the seismic shock of leaving the single market and customs union,\u201d Sampson said. \u201cThe big gains in the next five years will come by focusing on what\u2019s happening with the EU and trying to simplify our relationship.\u201d\n\nDavid Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project, said that the government\u2019s fourth anniversary of Brexit document was \u201cthe usual set of claims that are in various ways slightly distorted\u201d."}

But Jeff, a professional video gamer, thinks well-meaning parents, partners and friends may have done just that if they have celebrated a special occasion by presenting someone with a voucher for an online gaming platform.\n\nJeff is prodigiously talented at Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), a wildly popular military-style shooter played by millions around the world. He has 750,000 subscribers on YouTube alone, a highly engaged fanbase willing to spend money on their hobby.\n\nOne day in spring last year, Jeff opened an email from his agent and his eyes widened. A company was willing to pay him $280,000 over two months in exchange for just a handful of 30-second advertising spots on his YouTube channel.\n\nBut rather than grab the opportunity with both hands, Jeff took a different approach. He decided to break ranks with the elite CS:GO player community and battle a new enemy by exposing the murky business behind the tantalising offer: \u201cskins gambling\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wanted to show how unregulated gambling is rotting the brains of young people,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the uninitiated, \u201cskins\u201d are virtual items within a computer game that can be bought for money, or won as a reward for gameplay. Skins might be devastating weapons, a snazzy uniform for a character or \u2013 in a football game \u2013 a player who could be the missing link to complete an all-conquering team.\n\nView image in fullscreen Characters from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Weapons and outfits can be bought for real or virtual currency. Photograph: Screengrab\n\nAs the cost of developing video games has soared, such in-game spending opportunities have helped gaming companies open up new sources of regular, repeating revenue that extend beyond the initial purchase.\n\nTypically, skins are contained in \u201cloot boxes\u201d or \u201ccases\u201d, which gamers pay small sums for without knowing what they will get.\n\nLoot boxes have already become a lightning rod for controversy due to their gambling-style mechanism, although the UK government has refused to recognise them as gambling products.\n\nWhile skins can be found in loot boxes, they can also be bought in the online marketplace operated by online gaming platform Steam \u2013 the medium through which many games such as CS:GO are played.\n\nThrough that marketplace, skins can also be transferred between players and into the game. There, competitors can use them to gain an advantage, or just for cosmetic effect.\n\nWhat bothered Jeff, however, was not so much the loot boxes or the skins in themselves but another phenomenon that they have spawned: skins gambling.\n\nThis works like any other casino. You load up your account with funds, place a bet, watch the graphics spin and either win or lose.\n\nThe big difference in this case is that the casino taking your bet has no gambling licence and, in some cases, no reliable mechanism to stop under-18s getting their first taste of gambling \u2013 via an online ecosystem that is, to many parents, a total mystery.\n\nNor can you win any money, at least not directly. In the world of skins gambling, websites allow gamers the opportunity to stake cash, cryptocurrency or even other skins for the chance of winning a skin of great value.\n\nIf you do win, the gambling website effectively procures the skin on your behalf, through a peer-to-peer skins trading platform, and passes it on to you for use in the game.\n\nSome skins carry enormous price tags in the real world. One website that tracks skin prices values a \u201cGungnir\u201d sniper rifle, available in the CS:GO game, at more than $18,000. A knife \u2013 a \u201cfactory new, case-hardened Karambit, pattern 387 (blue gem)\u201d \u2013 is reputedly the most expensive CS:GO skin in history, attracting a $1.5m offer that its owner turned down. Further down the scale, guns, outfits, stickers and knives sell for hundreds of dollars.\n\nView image in fullscreen The buying of \u2018loot boxes\u2019 \u2013 an assortment of items sold sight unseen \u2013 also contains an element of luck. Photograph: James Thew/Alamy\n\nThe overall size of the skins wagering market is not well charted but one estimate from 2016 put a figure of $3bn on the amount wagered through skins casino sites.\n\nCS:GO is almost the only game in town when it comes to skins and their use in gambling, with the majority of such sites focusing almost exclusively on skins linked to the game.\n\nThe operator that offered the promotional deal to Jeff, Cyprus-based KeyDrop, attracted almost 17 million visitors in one month last year. It has dozens of competitors, sites such as Hellcase, from Singapore, Belize-registered CSGORoll and CSFail, whose website cites a UK address in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.\n\nNone of these sites has a licence from a gambling regulator such as the UK Gambling Commission. Yet the service they offer bears striking similarities with an online casino, including games that mimic roulette, slot machines or other games of chance. The only difference, ostensibly, is that you are wagering to win a digital asset rather than cash you can take to the bank.\n\nSo far, in the UK at least, the ability to \u201ccash out\u201d is a crucial determining factor in whether an activity is defined as gambling or not. The government stopped short of designating loot boxes as gambling earlier this year partly on this basis.\n\nBut the reality is that it can be literally child\u2019s play to turn skins into hard cash. To use sites such as KeyDrop, players must have an account on the Steam platform, which was created by the maker of CS:GO, US-based game developer Valve.\n\nSteam has its own marketplace, where gamers can trade skins. Gift cards to help gamers buy such skins are big business at Christmas, an obvious choice for anyone with a relative or a friend who loves nothing more than spending hours in front of a game.\n\nThe Steam marketplace is self-contained, at least initially. You can load cash into your wallet and use those funds to buy skins from Steam or from other gamers. You cannot, however, withdraw the funds. In \u00adtheory, therefore, the marketplace is not somewhere you could properly cash out any winnings.\n\nBut an industry has sprung up: third-party marketplaces such as SkinBaron and Skinwallet, where you can sell skins, including those won on gambling sites, for real money.\n\nJeff thinks that while Valve does not endorse or take a cut from skins gambling, or the third-party websites where bettors can effectively cash out their winnings, it benefits indirectly from this little-scrutinised industry. \u201cIt [skins gambling] helps drive the value of the skins up and Valve takes a cut of every Steam market sale. So in the end they get more.\u201d\n\nPlenty of other participants in the world of online gaming benefit too. When Jeff rejected the offer to promote skins gambling, he instead set about making a documentary, raising his concerns about the industry.\n\nThat meant exposing some of the biggest names in esports \u2013 the professional video gamers who make a good living from sponsorship deals with the very websites Jeff was openly condemning.\n\nOf the top 300 CS:GO streamers, more than 200 are sponsored by the industry.\n\nView image in fullscreen Two professional gaming teams competing against each other in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Photograph: Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, there has been some backlash to Jeff\u2019s decision to blow the whistle. While the response from ordinary gamers has been positive \u2013 comments on his YouTube channel are overwhelmingly congratulatory \u2013 he has received threats and intimidation too.\n\n\u201cWe know where you live my dude,\u201d one anonymous person wrote.\n\nSkins gambling has grown increasingly controversial in the gaming world amid the growing realisation that what looks like just another facet of gaming is actually more akin to bog-standard gambling.\n\nA study published last year, led by Dr Heather Wardle of the University of Glasgow, found that, among adults, participation in skins gambling was a reliable predictor that someone would develop a gambling problem \u2013 more reliable than the playing of high-octane casino products such as online slot machines.\n\nSlowly, parts of the CS:GO community and the wider world of gaming appear to be growing uneasy about this. Soon after Jeff\u2019s documentary aired, Twitch \u2013 the user-generated video-streaming site where gaming is big business \u2013 banned the promotion of skins gambling.\n\nG2, one of the world\u2019s top esports teams, came under fire recently for announcing a partnership with the skins website CSGORoll \u2013 a tie-up launched by one of their star players, who had turned 18 the day before.\n\nG2 appears to have started removing CSGORoll imagery from its own material recently, although the team still features prominently on CSGORoll\u2019s own site.\n\nCSGORoll said it was not offering a gambling product and that it used third-party age verification services to check that customers who deposited more than \u00a3500 were aged 18.\n\nSome governments are taking notice. Denmark has blocked the IP addresses of several skins gambling sites, while countries such as France are taking similar steps and the Netherlands is understood to be behind proposals to legislate at European level. The UK, by contrast, has taken no action at all.\n\nThe UK Gambling Commission has previously expressed concerns about this but there is little, in practice, that the regulator can do when the law does not recognise skins casinos as gambling platforms. The regulator said it was \u201ccontinuing to explore the legal position of different models\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for SkinBaron said Steam\u2019s owner, Valve, had introduced a seven-day lock on trades of skins, making skins \u201cnot a valid short-term payment option\u201d for gambling. They said SkinBaron operated a strict over-18s policy.\n\nHellcase said its service was not gambling and that it operated an over-18 age gate.\n\nCSFail and KeyDrop did not return a request for comment. Skinwallet could not be reached. Valve did not return a request for comment sent via its website."}

Starters \u00a35-\u00a311, mains \u00a311-\u00a319, desserts \u00a34.95-\u00a35.50, wines from \u00a317\n\nI am standing in front of a corrugated shutter in Lewisham, southeast London, thinking about what might have been. Behind this shutter is a one-time caff, a venerable greasy spoon if you will, that once traded in the holy trinity of egg, chips and beans, alongside steaming mugs of tea the colour of a Caramac bar. Recently it was taken over by the Italian Antonio Delicatessen next door. It\u2019s still a caff, only now one with a strong Italian accent, utilising the ingredients stocked by the mothership.\n\nWe mourn the passing of greasy spoons and with good reason. They are vital third spaces; community hubs that feed more than just our bellies. But they are too easily defined by menu. There are one-time greasy spoons serving cheap Greek Cypriot, Chinese and Thai food. This one could still be true to its origins, even with a rag\u00f9-splattered menu. It\u2019s about intent, not recipes. Anyway, all this ethnographic guff is irrelevant, because for reasons described as \u201cunforeseen\u201d, it\u2019s closed. It\u2019s a flinty, brooding word, that. Good things are rarely described as unforeseen and certainly not ones that lead to the three-week closure of a business. My thoughts are with everybody involved with Antonio Caffe & Restaurant in Lewisham. I will return another time. And for those wondering, it doesn\u2019t have a website let alone a fancy online booking widget. There was no reason to call, so its closure was unforeseen to me, too.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Marinated in a deep sauce of tomato, herbs and garlic\u2019: shredded green beans. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer\n\nHere am I, then, amid the rumble and chunter of Lewisham\u2019s traffic on a cold winter\u2019s day beneath a 3B-pencil-lead sky. I am with a couple of friends, their delicious baby daughter and have both a deadline and nowhere to eat. I bash away at Google Maps. I blink at the digital ink of red knives and forks, and click furiously on descriptions. I get excited when I spot a nearby South African restaurant. That sounds interesting. Oh, hang on. It\u2019s a Nando\u2019s. There is, of course, a Burger King, a Greggs and a Subway, the three popes of the British high street. I am no longer a food professional, patrolling the waterfront of British dining, an eyebrow raised. I\u2019m just a bloke on the hunt for lunch on a cold winter\u2019s day.\n\nThen I look up from my phone. According to the map in my hand, there\u2019s a Turkish place just 20m away called Levante. Indeed there is. I\u2019d walked past its bright red frontage and not even noticed. This is the best kind of news. When I am travelling the country and know I\u2019ll need dinner late at night, I generally search first for Turkish grill houses. This is because they are never bad. This may look like a grand statement, but I hold by it. Some may be better than others. But I\u2019ve never been to one that didn\u2019t deliver on the fundamentals: bright fresh salads; puffy, charred breads; smoky grills. Basically, all the good things, which in turn make you feel good about yourself. I suspect this is because, just like the greasy spoon, they too are third spaces. They are places where Turkey\u2019s various communities gather, which means there is no room to be lazy or bad.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Salty-sweet, crisply fatted\u2019: lamb ribs. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer\n\nCheerily, Levante proves the rule. It really is great. Being so, it would be churlish of me not to tell you about it. There\u2019s a charcoal grill at the front, enclosed behind glass and beaten-out aluminium. Smoke pirouettes upwards from the coals and the warm air smells of caramelising onions, freshly baked bread and gently charring lamb. It\u2019s a long, simple room with a cafeteria vibe, half wood-panelled, white above, and hung with a few bold paintings of the old country. The tables are fake marble Formica-style and the chairs are solid and comfortable. A TV screen dangles from the ceiling, presumably for when Galatasaray does its thing. At the end, enclosed in a faux wooden country cabin, complete with sloping roof, is the bar. It\u2019s an outbreak of shameless kitsch amid the functional.\n\nTurkish food is accidentally custom-engineered as a response to the question, \u201cHave you got any dietaries?\u201d It does animal and vegetable with equal enthusiasm. From the list of cold meze we have shredded green beans, marinated in a deep sauce of tomato, herbs and garlic. There\u2019s the sour hit of sumac and sparkling green pools of peppery olive oil. Aubergines are roasted until soft, sweet and messy. More of the aubergine turns up as a topping for a hot-crusted bready canoe of pide. There\u2019s also a bowl of herb-speckled lentil soup on our table, there to tell the weather outside where to stick it. The soup is thick, cumin-spiked and a deep colour that Dulux might name Burnt Orange, and Farrow & Ball would call Charlotte\u2019s Locks. The grills include a kebab of slumping onions, aubergines and mushrooms generously swamped in a long-reduced tomato sauce.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018A hot-crusted bready canoe\u2019: aubergine pide. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer\n\nFrom the keto side of the dietaries, we have chicken livers, grilled until crusty, but seared quickly enough to save them from becoming dry. Then there are the salty-sweet, crisply fatted lamb ribs. These are sliced across the middle to create more surface area and happily lubricate the surrounding heaps of rice with tributaries of liquid fats. Cut through all that with a forkful of shredded red cabbage, doused with olive oil and lemon. Play culinary Russian roulette with the pickled green pepper. Or try some of the grilled sea bream, opened out so the pale flesh has bronzed and crisped.\n\nDesserts are on a shiny, laminated menu that suggests they are brought in. They insist the kunefe is made on site. Honestly, it\u2019s so good I don\u2019t care where it comes from. Noodle-like shredded pastry is packed into a metal dish and layered with sweet, stringy cheese, which is then covered with more of the shredded wheat-like pastry. It\u2019s baked until golden and crisp, then doused in syrup. Oh God. Order a Turkish coffee to defend against well-earned droop and drowsiness.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Golden and crisp\u2019: kunefe. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer\n\nThis is my second accidental meal in Lewisham in recent months, the other being at the Sri Lankan Everest Curry King, which has gone through a few changes since I drooled over it last year. Some of the locals are cross about that. I doubt Levante will change. It does its great-value thing and it does it very well indeed. On a cold winter\u2019s day, it was restaurant not just as refuge, but as happy find. I left invigorated, fed and very grateful.\n\nNews bites\n\nOver Christmas, the nation rejoiced as I stormed to victory in the critics\u2019 episode of MasterChef. Now you can bid to have me come to your house and cook all the MasterChef-winning dishes for you: that\u2019s the spare ribs with cumin, salt and chilli with a cucumber salad, the seafood fregola and the baked chocolate and cherry pudding. All proceeds from the winning bid will go to support the vital work of The Food Chain, a small London charity giving nutritional advice and support to people with HIV, of which I am a patron. The dinner is for up to eight people, at a venue within the M25 on a date to be mutually agreed and bidding, via eBay, closes on 11 February at 6pm. To bid go here.\n\nThe Rectory in Crudwell, Wiltshire, has appointed the former head chef of Bocca di Lupo, in London, to run their kitchens. Jake Simpson, who has also worked with Jeremy Lee at the Blueprint Caf\u00e9 and Quo Vadis, has put together a new menu, including egg yolk raviolo, with bottarga butter, venison haunch with faggot and pickled prune and a pistachio cake with quince. Back in Soho, Gareth Saywell, who was previously head chef at Orasay, has replaced Simpson as head chef at Bocca di Lupo (therectoryhotel.com).\n\nJonny Farrell, an award-winning Lancashire-based butcher, is opening his own restaurant in Birkdale Village, Stockport.

Around it, the historic old city is also in tatters. The 7th-century mosque, also known as the Great Mosque of Gaza, was Gaza\u2019s most famous and its surroundings a focal point of the Palestinian enclave\u2019s history and culture, but the damage done to its heritage over more than 100 days of Israeli bombardment spreads across the city.\n\nFor the few Palestinians who remain, and the far greater number displaced and hoping to return, the culture and history has been reduced to memories.\n\n\u201cThe city is a ghost town, people walk around with pale faces and their spirits are tired after having gone through this war. If you walk to the old city of Gaza, you will only remember the memories and feel sickened and saddened by the amount of destruction of cultural and religious sites,\u201d said Bader Alzaharna, who lives in Gaza City despite the intensity of Israel\u2019s ground operation in the area.\n\n\u201cThe old city of Gaza, which used to be full of cultural sites, is grey and overcast. Walking in Gaza feels like we are in a movie, in a fictional story, in a fantasy. The scene is apocalyptic.\u201d\n\nUnesco, the UN agency responsible for protecting culture, says it has verified damage to at least 22 sites, including mosques, churches, historical homes, universities, archives and the archeological site of Anthedon Harbour, Gaza\u2019s first known seaport.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Great Mosque before the conflict began. Photograph: Anadolu/Ali Jadallah/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nThe agency said it had received reports of damage to other sites but had not been able to verify them through the means available, mainly satellite imagery, because of the conflict.\n\nA recent report by the Palestinian culture ministry into Israeli damage to Palestinian heritage said Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza had destroyed 207 buildings of cultural or historical significance, including 144 in the old city and 25 religious sites.\n\nThe damage has also included an ancient Roman cemetery and the Commonwealth war cemetery, where more than 3,000 British and commonwealth soldiers are buried after dying in battles during the first and second world wars.\n\nUnesco has warned that more sites are at risk of damage, including one of the region\u2019s oldest Christian monasteries, the Saint Hilarion complex, which it said had not been damaged yet but was in an area of intense fighting.\n\n\u201cUnesco is deeply concerned about damage of cultural and historical sites in Gaza. While humanitarian emergencies are a legitimate priority, the protection of cultural heritage in all its forms \u2013 as well as the protection of educational infrastructures and journalists \u2013 must also be ensured, in accordance with international law, which stipulates that cultural property is civilian infrastructure,\u201d the agency said.\n\nWissam Nassar, a photographer who covered several wars in Gaza but also documented its culture, said the damage to the Omari mosque and its surroundings had hit him personally due to the time he spent there.\n\n\u201cThis mosque holds a special place for every Palestinian in Gaza, as it was a gathering point during Ramadan and a place for worship and Quranic readings. As a photographer, it has a special significance for me, capturing many moments and memories inside this mosque,\u201d said Nassar.\n\nNassar, who now lives in Canada, said he remembers visiting the old city, including the now-destroyed Turkish baths, both as a photographer and in his personal life. He said the damage to Christian sites, such as the Saint Porphyrius Orthodox church complex, near the Omari mosque, also damaged Gaza\u2019s diversity.\n\nView image in fullscreen The ruins of al-Hassaina Mosque, damaged in Israeli bombardment. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cAs a photographer I will carry sadness throughout my life because these historical buildings are difficult to restore, and their loss is irreplaceable. I will remember them in every moment, as we have thousands of memories within these places. However, the greater sorrow will be felt when I look at the pictures I took inside these archaeological sites.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Israel destroyed everything beautiful in Gaza. Israel aimed to destroy not only people but also stones, infrastructure and historical buildings, wanting to eradicate human life and cultural heritage.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s case at the international court of justice in the Hague accusing Israel of genocide, which led to the court to order Israel to prevent its troops carrying out acts that could amount to genocide, included claims that Israel had targeted Palestinian culture.\n\nIt also accused Israel of destroying modern museums and cultural centres and threatening Gaza\u2019s \u201ccultural potential\u201d through damage to schools, as well as the killing of journalists, teachers and intellectuals.\n\nIsber Sabrine, head of the Heritage for Peace NGO, said the damage done to Gaza\u2019s heritage would be lasting and reached far beyond physical buildings. That done to religious sites, he said, would affect the social life of both Muslims and Christians and would take a long time to rehabilitate.\n\n\u201cThe destruction of heritage in Gaza is also the destruction of traditions, it\u2019s also the destruction of their habits, of their culture,\u201d said Sabrine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge destruction of heritage to intentionally disconnect the people of Gaza from their land. It\u2019s important to preserve and restore. When the war stops there will be a need to evaluate what is destroyed.\u201d"}

He is very false and tries far too hard to be likable. I\u2019ve been talking about him to a lot of people. He is very good at charming people in public situations. I\u2019m someone who is so against being fake that trying to do so has had a negative physical impact on my body. It seems this man can\u2019t stand that he can\u2019t charm me.\n\nHe is an emotional sadist and has attempted on many occasions to break students in the name of showing us how challenging and difficult the work can be. There is no aftercare and I don\u2019t see how students reliving memories of trauma in front of an entire class is benefiting any of them.\n\nLast year, I was sitting chatting to one peer, who hates the lecturer as much as I do, when I had an encounter with him that almost made me throw up. Many of my class were hopeful we would not have him again, but we\u2019ve found out he is teaching us until the end of the year. I cried when I heard this. I can\u2019t bear having this smarmy man teaching me any more.\n\nPhilippa\u2019s answer We have a problem in society today: we are getting too good at hating. Too good at thinking in terms of goodies and baddies, and we are always the goodies, aren\u2019t we? But maybe we\u2019re not. We\u2019re getting too good, in my opinion, at judging and labelling others. Maybe there aren\u2019t goodies and baddies. I think we are all a mixture of both. And perhaps there are better ways of thinking than such black and white terms of good and bad, right and wrong. Perhaps such concepts are unhelpful for us individually and as a society.\n\nYour dislike of this authority figure \u2013 which I suspect many readers will identify with \u2013 was instant, \u201cfrom day one\u201d, so my guess (it can only be a guess) would be that he reminded you of someone who emotionally neglected you or otherwise caused you harm at some point in your life. I think it is possible that he has, unwittingly, triggered an emotion that may belong more in your past than it does in the present.\n\nPerhaps he does put on a larger-than-life act when he is in public and he may try too hard to be friendly. But his having a different mode of being, which you dislike, would not be enough, on its own, to cause this extreme reaction, unless you are somehow previously inclined to dislike someone who comes across as he does. When someone has neglected us, or caused us harm, it is a human trait to be on edge around anyone who reminds us of that person; humans are predisposed to make generalisations.\n\nYou will know as a psychotherapy trainee that when we relate to someone not as they are in the present but, instead, react to an emotion they have unwittingly triggered from our past, we call this \u201ctransference\u201d. This is because we are transferring a feeling that we associate with one person on to another.\n\nAlternatively, rather than thinking he is the sole source of your bad feeling, locate this feeling instead within yourself. Not many people want to do this because it is so much more satisfying to hate than it is to understand what triggers our own dislike and then take responsibility for it. You experience him as smarmy and as someone to be wary of, but it will be useful to find out how that causes such an extreme reaction in you.\n\nMany psychotherapy courses encourage trainees to do personal work in the training group, as it is easier to learn theory when you experience it, rather than just reading and talking about it. You say there is no aftercare, yet almost all courses insist students undergo their own therapy in order to undertake training. This is because learning how we humans manage and don\u2019t manage our emotions will inevitably stir them up.\n\nYou cannot assume his motivation to work as he does is sadism! We often believe we know others\u2019 motivations when we are only projecting what we assume it would mean to us if we were to act in that way.\n\nRather than gossip behind a person\u2019s back, address any issue with that person with them. Talking behind someone\u2019s back is called \u201cnegative contracting\u201d. Negative contracting may be a useful way to bond with others, but it doesn\u2019t feed your own personal development and it will influence how other people experience the person gossiped about in potentially harmful ways.\n\nTo get unstuck, you could talk to him about the reaction he brings up in you, or work through these feelings in your own private therapy sessions.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see this as an opportunity for growth, you could switch to another institute, but you might be faced with the same situation again, as a propensity to dislike may be one of your issues.\n\nRecommended reading Transference and Projection: Mirrors to the Self, by Jan Grant.\n\nPhilippa Perry\u2019s The Book You Want Everyone You Love* To Read *(and maybe a few you don\u2019t) is published by Cornerstone at \u00a318.99.

The trial has been set up to evaluate the therapy\u2019s safety and effectiveness in treating melanoma, lung cancer and other solid tumours.\n\nThe new treatment uses genetic material known as messenger RNA \u2013 or mRNA \u2013 and works by presenting common markers from tumours to the patient\u2019s immune system.\n\nThe aim is to help it recognise and fight cancer cells that express those markers.\n\n\u201cNew mRNA-based cancer immunotherapies offer an avenue for recruiting the patient\u2019s own immune system to fight their cancer,\u201d said Dr David Pinato of Imperial College London, an investigator with the trial\u2019s UK arm.\n\nPinato said this research was still in its early stages and could take years before becoming available for patients. However, the new trial was laying crucial groundwork that could help develop less toxic and more precise new anti-cancer therapies. \u201cWe desperately need these to turn the tide against cancer,\u201d he added.\n\nA number of cancer vaccines have recently entered clinical trials across the globe. These fall into two categories: personalised cancer immunotherapies, which rely on extracting a patient\u2019s own genetic material from their tumours; and therapeutic cancer immunotherapies, such as the mRNA therapy newly launched in London, which are \u201cready made\u201d and tailored to a particular type of cancer.\n\nThe primary aim of the new trial \u2013 known as Mobilize \u2013 is to discover if this particular type of mRNA therapy is safe and tolerated by patients with lung or skin cancers and can shrink tumours. It will be administered alone in some cases and in combination with the existing cancer drug pembrolizumab in others.\n\nResearchers say that while the experimental therapy is still in the early stages of testing, they hope it may ultimately lead to a new treatment option for difficult-to-treat cancers, should the approach be proven to be safe and effective.\n\nNearly one in two people in the UK will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. A range of therapies have been developed to treat patients, including chemotherapy and immune therapies.\n\nHowever, cancer cells can become resistant to drugs, making tumours more difficult to treat, and scientists are keen to seek new approaches for tackling cancers.\n\nPreclinical testing in both cell and animal models of cancer provided evidence that new mRNA therapy had an effect on the immune system and could be offered to patients in early-phase clinical trials."}

Bundled into a black van \u2013 its tinted windows shielding what would happen next \u2013 the masked men soon told him why they had come: the former entrepreneur and one-time opposition politician had dared to apologise for crimes committed by Serbs when inter\u00ad-ethnic conflict convulsed Kosovo in the late 1990s after the violent break-up of Yugoslavia.\n\n\u201cIt was unimaginable,\u201d he told the Observer, recalling the ordeal in his first interview with a British newspaper since the alleged assault. \u201cThe day after I posted the video on social media saying \u2018sorry\u2019 as I laid flowers at the grave of the young girl who, yes, was related to a founder of the Kosovo Liberation Army [which led the revolt against Serbian rule] I got threats.\n\n\u201cThen when the beatings started they hit me so hard I lost consciousness. In the van I was hit on my head, punched in my face and kicked. In the [lobby of] BIA\u2019s headquarters, they removed my shirt and forced me to kneel and kiss the pictures on the wall of agents who had died in Kosovo. They kept asking who was behind my decision to visit the burial site, who was bribing me to do such things.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Nikola Sandulovi\u0107 laying flowers on the grave of a seven-year-old girl killed during inter-ethnic conflict in the 1990s. Photograph: unknown\n\nThe torture, Sandulovi\u0107 claimed, lasted six hours. \u201cThey sat on both my legs, pulled my arms and yanked back my head while they videoed [the scenes] and shouted \u2018traitor\u2019,\u201d said the 60-year-old, displaying a still visibly bruised forearm. \u201cIn the end I said, \u2018I won\u2019t answer any more questions. Kill me or call a doctor.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdmitted that evening to a military hospital, it would be 24 hours before the self-described pacifist was allowed back home where police, armed with an arrest warrant, wasted no time in seizing him again. The next 12 days \u2013 bar an overnight stay at a state clinic \u2013 would be spent in the medical wing of Belgrade Central prison, detained by a prosecutor on suspicion of \u201cinciting racial, national and religious hatred\u201d. The KLA has been branded a terrorist organisation by Serbia.\n\nFor Aleksandar Vulin, the country\u2019s former intelligence chief who admitted ordering the arrest, Sandulovi\u0107\u2019s actions in support of Kosovo were deserving of much greater punishment. The BIA agents, he told the Novosti news outlet, had indeed picked him up but refrained from using any physical force \u2013 tactics other secret services would undoubtedly have employed. \u201cIf Sandulovi\u0107 had laid a wreath on Himmler\u2019s grave, Mossad would have killed him \u2026 I apologise to Serbia for not being able to do more.\u201d A close ally of Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, Serbia\u2019s rightwing populist president, the unabashedly pro-Russian Vulin resigned in November after being sanctioned by the US for misuse of public office and involvement in illegal arms smuggling.\n\nWith the rhetoric at such levels \u2013 Vulin is the only official to have spoken publicly about the incident \u2013 observers say it is indicative of the mood at large, one likened increasingly by Serbs to the climate that prevailed under Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the erstwhile strongman still dubbed the Butcher of the Balkans.\n\nBefore the alleged assault catapulted the avowedly pro-western Sandulovi\u0107 on to the pages of the international press \u2013 for his plight has been given little coverage locally \u2013 he was a controversial figure on the margins of the political firmament of a country dominated by the autocratic rule of Vu\u010di\u0107.\n\nThe last time he contested national elections was in 2016 when his small Serbian Republican party won less than 1% of the vote. \u201cThe censorship is insane. Vu\u010di\u0107 controls everything. He steals votes and it\u2019s impossible to be heard,\u201d he lamented.\n\nWestern envoys who weighed in urging Sandulovic\u2019s release \u2013 US diplomats are among those who have also made the trip to the villa to hold bedside talks with him \u2013 admitted having to delve deep into their archives to find out who he was, and not liking everything they discovered.\n\nBut amid escalating regional tensions, exacerbated by overt Russian meddling across the Balkan peninsula, the attempt to present the politician as a fifth columnist has highlighted fears over Serbia\u2019s democratic decline at a time when the EU candidate state has been gripped by protests over allegations that Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s recent re-election was rigged.\n\n\u201cFor the authorities it\u2019s not a good look,\u201d said one diplomat. \u201cReconciliation in these parts is never a bad thing and in this case it cannot be denied.\u201d\n\nIn an address on Friday, Vu\u010di\u0107 accused Kosovo\u2019s ethnic Albanian leaders of intending to \u201cethnically cleanse\u201d the territory of its Serb minority following its decision to ban the use of the Serbian dinar and enforce the euro as the former province\u2019s sole currency. Vowing to ignore the measure, he pledged to seek an urgent UN security council meeting tomorrow, saying local Serbs \u201care scared, they are waiting in line\u201d for fear of being unable to receive dinar-denominated pensions and wages.\n\nBelgrade has vehemently refused to recognise Kosovo \u2013 home to some of Serbia\u2019s most revered religious sites and regarded by Serbs as a \u201choly land\u201d if also predominantly Albanian \u2013 in the 16 years since it unilaterally declared independence.\n\nAcross Belgrade, daubed on bridges and communist-era buildings, graffiti exhorts onlookers to never forget \u201cKosovo is Serbia\u201d.\n\nIn a polarised society the province is the wound that has continued to fester. Its fate was sealed when in 1999 Nato intervened with a 78-day air campaign to end ethnic cleansing that had seen more than 300,000 Kosovars flee. To this day it remains the one issue that unites Serbs.\n\nFor opposition leaders Kosovo is also the reason the west is soft on Vu\u010di\u0107, a politician whose provocative views are stomached because he is perceived as being able to guarantee regional stability. \u201cNo politician in this country will ever accept the independence of Kosovo,\u201d observed Dragan Dilas, a former mayor of Belgrade who heads the party of Freedom and Justice, part of the Serbia Against Violence coalition that has staged street protests deploring Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s fraudulent electoral victory.\n\n\u201cBut Vu\u010di\u0107 exploits that. Every day he isolates Serbia a little more from its natural allies. Geographically, culturally, historically we belong to Europe. We don\u2019t want to be part of a Russian or Chinese world, which is what he wants. It saddens us greatly that we are the only pro-EU opposition anywhere that doesn\u2019t have the support of the west. I tell you, the atmosphere here is as bad, if not worse, than it was under Milosevic.\u201d\n\nLast week \u0108edomir Stojkovi\u0107, the prominent human rights lawyer representing Sandulovi\u0107, described him as one of the few figures in Serbia who would ever publicly endorse Kosovo\u2019s independence.\n\n\u201cHe was attacked in this way because he says things nobody wants to hear,\u201d he averred. \u201cFor me Nikola is more of a political activist and sometimes he makes provocative statements, but under what law, in what country on this planet, is placing flowers on the grave of a seven-year-old girl illegal?\u201d\n\nOn Thursday Michael Polak, a British barrister, walked into Belgrade\u2019s Palace of Justice in brogues and a finely cut suit with Stojkovic to file a criminal complaint against \u201cSandulovi\u0107\u2019s torturers\u201d and illegal detention. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable in a European country in 2024 that someone can be abducted from their home by state agents and subjected to this type of treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cAt no time should there be impunity for torture. Under the European convention of human rights Serbia has a duty to investigate the allegations and hold the perpetrators to account.\u201d\n\nLater as he was about to leave the country, Polak was detained at Belgrade airport by police demanding to know why he was \u201cinterfering in internal Serbian affairs\u201d. When finally allowed to board the plane he was told he would not be welcome back."}

A couple of singles and that is DRINKS. With the lead 341, and Gill in sight of his hundred, Tim de Lisle will take you through to stumps.\n\n\n\n27m ago 02.38 EST 50th over: India 192-4 (Gill 96, Axar 28) Gill gets fed up with prodding around, sweeping Bashir for four. One shot away from three figures.\n\n\n\n29m ago 02.36 EST 49th over: India 186-4 (Gill 90, Axar 28) Another couple knocked onto the total. KP still talking, so much talking!, on comms.

This is the calm before the storm.\n\n\n\n35m ago 02.30 EST 47th over: India 183-4 (Gill 89, Axar 25) Just one off Hartley. \u201cGreetings from Chennai!\u201d Hello stranger.\n\n\n\n\u201dYou had expressed curiosity about Shreyas Iyer being referred to by his full name. I can\u2019t give you a satisfactory answer on that -- I have certainly heard him called simply Shreyas on comms before -- but I can provide some background.\n\n\n\n\u201dThere are primarily three types of name used in India, differing based on the region, community and religion.\n\n\n\n\u201dFirstly you have Western-style name + family name, as with Virat Kohli or Cheteshwar Pujara. Though many of these are rather clan than family names, there is no issue referring to these people by their surnames as with English names.\n\n\n\n\u201dSecondly you have people like Rohit Sharma, Shreyas Iyer and Mukesh Kumar. Their surnames are much more generic, tied to a community, caste or region than to a family, and thus there has been a shift away from using just those names (eg. \u201cMr Sharma\u201d) in English coverage in recent years, in favour of using the full name or just the given name. In any case Indian languages have always used given names for such people.\n\n\n\n\u201dThirdly you have people like Ravichandran Ashwin or Washington Sundar who have no surnames as such. They just use their own given name (Ashwin and Washington respectively) plus their fathers\u2019 given name, which can be in any order. This is normal in southern India and the father\u2019s name is usually abbreviated to an initial (eg. \u201cR. Ashwin\u201d). In this case the only correct way is to use the given name. If you refer to Ashwin as \u201cRavichandran\u201d or Washington as \u201cSundar\u201d, you are actually referring to their fathers!\n\n\n\n\u201dIndeed, if Shreyas Santosh Iyer had been born in Tamil Nadu or Kerala (where the Iyer community originates), he would most likely have been called Shreyas Santosh, as the practice of using community/caste surnames has fallen out of favour there.\u201d\n\n\n\nThank you! That has answered lots of questions (and provoked more!).\n\n\n\n39m ago 02.26 EST 46th over: India 182-4 (Gill 89, Axar 25) My husband pollutes the room with marmalade on toast, Bashir throws in some variety, India collect a couple of singles and the fifth wicket partnership stretches to 60.\n\n\n\n43m ago 02.22 EST 45th over: India 180-4 (Gill 88, Axar 24) Tom Hartley for the first time since lunch. Axar eyes up his first ball, a half volley, and slots him away past mid-off for four to roars of approval from the crowd. More single milking.\n\n\n\n46m ago 02.19 EST 44th over: India 174-4 (Gill 87, Axar 19) Bashir, tall and lean.

The first ball is a post-prandial pudding, and Gill gratefully takes two runs. A leg bye, then Axar leans way onto the back foot and clops him for four. Nine from the over. And no, ignore what I said about Root, Dan Lawrence is on the field for him. The cameras have found some footage from practise this morning when Root was also hit on the same finger.\n\n\n\n2h ago 01.14 EST Just to catch up elsewhere, at the Bay Oval, Rachin Ravindra has just made his maiden Test century, and Kane Williamson his 30th.

Joe Biden won the Democratic presidential primary in South Carolina with a high-90s percentage that would make even Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong-un blush.\n\nBut despite the low energy and low turnout, there was a wider narrative on Saturday about representation, the changing face of the US and a rebuke to the white identity politics of Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, 81, may be a stick-in-the-mud but it was he who last year tore up the tradition, which took hold in earnest with Jimmy Carter in 1976, of Iowa and New Hampshire going first in picking the Democratic candidate for president.\n\nAt his behest, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rearranged the electoral calendar so that South Carolina would have first say in shaping the race this time. That South Carolina is also that state that revived Biden\u2019s ailing 2020 campaign probably didn\u2019t do its cause any harm.\n\nStill, anyone who spent parts of last month freezing in Iowa and New Hampshire after the Republican primary was reminded how demographically unrepresentative those states are. Both are about 90% white. At Trump\u2019s campaign rallies, unsurprisingly, the whiteness appeared even more monolithic.\n\nIn South Carolina, however, one in four residents is Black. The state is more in keeping with a rainbow nation where Republicans appear to be in denial that white Christians are no longer the majority. Biden\u2019s decision to put it first was more important than any worries about enthusiasm or turnout on Saturday.\n\n\u201cFor South Carolina to go first is now a badge of honour and pride for so many folks,\u201d Jaime Harrison, chair of the DNC and himself a Black South Carolinian, told reporters in Columbia on Saturday night. \u201cI had one woman who was just teary-eyed with me when I was on the trail and just talking about the importance and the significance of going first.\n\n\u201cHearing the stories about people who could not vote and having those memories yourself and now hearing us talk about \u2018the hands that picked cotton are now the hands that are picking presidents\u2019 \u2013 that is impactful, it\u2019s powerful, and that is the imagery that is important for the nation to see and understand.\u201d\n\nStill, the final days before the historic vote felt somewhat anticlimactic thanks to a combination of Biden\u2019s dominance as incumbent, feeble opposition from Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson, and the lack of a Republican primary on the same day (which will take place later in the month).\n\nIt was all a far cry from the blockbuster 2016 primary season, when Trump was knocking out Republican stiffs while Bernie Sanders was giving Hillary Clinton a run for her money. On Friday Kamala Harris, the vice-president, drew only a modest crowd at a university in Orangeburg.\n\nOn Saturday, Democrats threw a watch party at the South Carolina state fairgrounds in Columbia, serving a buffet of meatballs, chicken, pasta, deviled eggs, fruit and vegetables. Red, white and blue flags were hung from the roof, tall blue curtains lined the walls, and the floor was carpeted blue and red. Two TV screens proclaimed \u201cF1rst in the nati\u2665n\u201d, the heart doubling as a map of South Carolina. There was a giant American flag behind the stage.\n\nThe president was not present but Congressman James Clyburn, whose endorsement transformed Biden\u2019s fortunes here four years ago, did get him on the phone and put him on loudspeaker, prompting whoops and cheers from the crowd.\n\nBiden said: \u201cI hope you can hear me. So what happened?\u201d Everyone laughed but then there was feedback on the mic.\n\nHarrison replied: \u201cI think a lot of stuff happened here in South Carolina today for you, sir.\u201d Biden asked: \u201cWhat kind of turnout you got?\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think you got it.\u201d More laughter in the room.\n\nNone of it said much about Biden\u2019s chances in November. He has already moved into general election mode, unleashing on Trump in a series of speeches. A common sentiment among his supporters in South Carolina was puzzlement \u2013 and frustration \u2013 that his booming economy is not getting the credit it deserves. Polls show that many voters, including some Black voters, agree with his likely opponent\u2019s slogan: \u201cBetter off under Trump.\u201d\n\nThere are other headaches too. As record numbers of migrants arrive at the southern border, Biden is criticised as too soft by the right and, as he now threatens draconian measures, too Trumpian by the left. Republicans say Biden botched the withdrawal from Afghanistan and displayed a weakness that emboldened Russia, Iran and Hamas, but progressives and Arab Americans are dismayed by his apparent lack of compassion for thousands of Palestinian dead.\n\nFinally, of course, there is the age question. At 81, Biden is the oldest president in American history. Would-be rivals such as Phillips and Nikki Haley are pushing the cause of a new generation. All these variables could matter in an election likely to be decided by gossamer-thin margins in a handful of swing states.\n\nVisiting his campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday, Biden acknowledged: \u201cIt\u2019s the weirdest campaign I\u2019ve ever been engaged in.\u201d\n\nBut interviews with voters during primary season in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have offered a reminder of an undeniable fact: Trump remains toxic to huge swaths of the American population. They will do anything to stop him. A criminal conviction between now and November may make them redouble their efforts.\n\nAmerica\u2019s racial divisions will be at the heart of it again. Christale Spain, the first Black woman elected as chair of South Carolina\u2019s Democratic party, recalled in an interview that her state\u2019s primary following the Iowa and New Hampshire contests in past cycles meant \u201cwe were correcting the course, correcting the ship every time\u201d.\n\nAnd in a speech to supporters, Harrison suggested that part of Biden\u2019s legacy is that future Democratic candidates will have to earn, not take for granted, African American support. \u201cWe proved that the days of folks parachuting in on election day asking for our votes \u2013 those days are over,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an electorate that looks like today\u2019s Democratic party and tomorrow\u2019s America.\u201d"}

Biden did not participate in the New Hampshire primary, which state Democratic officials held over the objections of the national committee.\n\nMarvin Pendarvis, a Democratic state representative from North Charleston, said the primary was important, regardless of turnout.\n\n\u201cEveryone probably wondered why was it so important that we got turnout, even when we knew that Joe Biden was going to win South Carolina. It\u2019s because we are first in the nation. It\u2019s because we want to maintain that status going into 2028.

Of South Carolina\u2019s 3.3 million registered voters, about 13% participated in the 2016 Democratic primary, which was won overwhelmingly by Hillary Clinton, while 16% voted in the 2020 primary that separated Biden from the pack.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s Republicans go to the polls on 24 February, when former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley faces former president Donald Trump.\n\nBiden\u2019s statement ended on a warning about the upcoming contest: \u201cThe stakes in this election could not be higher.

The president appears on course for an overwhelming victory in the first state to vote in the Democratic nomination process, after New Hampshire voters last month gave him the victory in that state\u2019s primary, even though he did not campaign.

In the meantime, here\u2019s what the Guardian\u2019s David Smith saw on the ground today in Columbia, as voting was under way: As predicted, South Carolina\u2019s Democratic primary Saturday is proving to be a low-key affair \u2013 but that hasn\u2019t stopped Joe Biden from trying to boost turnout. The president posted a video on the social media platform X in which he said simply: \u201cSouth Carolina, go vote today!\u201d Biden also made a stop at his 2024 campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, alongside his vice-president, Kamala Harris. Nearly seven in 10 voters have said they plan to vote for Biden during Saturday\u2019s primary, a recent Emerson College poll found. Challengers Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson were polling at about 5% and 3%, respectively. Three in 10 South Carolina voters were expected to take part in the primary. At least a handful of those who turned out to cast ballots did so despite encountering election day complications. People with plans to vote at the Arsenal Hill Center in Columbia were confronted with a sign informing them the polling place had been moved to the Earlewood Park Community Centre a mile and a half away. At the community centre in question, fewer than a hundred people had voted by noon. When one man was asked whether he had come to vote, he replied: \u201cNo \u2013 I\u2019m here to play tennis.\u201d But voters for Biden did include Lou Fontana, 70, who used to work in television and for the South Carolina park service. \u201cI believe in the man\u2019s politics,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in the fact that he\u2019s a good man. I think he\u2019s leading the country in a good direction. \u201cI can\u2019t see how people are missing the fact that the economy has rebounded so much, stock market\u2019s at an all-time high, we just had record job numbers again yesterday. I\u2019m not sure what people don\u2019t get.\u201d Despite low expected turnout in South Carolina primary, voters show up for Biden Read more\n\nUpdated at 19.14 EST\n\n8h ago 19.00 EST Polls close in South Carolina Democratic primary It\u2019s 7pm, and polls have closed in South Carolina\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Joe Biden is expected to win in a landslide, as incumbent presidents typically do. We\u2019ll let you know how big his victory is, and whether there are any signs of Democrats supporting the candidacies of Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson, or staying home altogether.\n\n\n\n8h ago 18.54 EST As hopeful as Democratic leaders are for a big Biden win in the South Carolina primary, the Guardian\u2019s George Chidi reports that poll workers were expecting low turnout for the vote: Two old men sat in the dark on a bench outside Dunston elementary school in North Charleston, South Carolina, waiting for a long day to start that would be quieter than they deserved. Few were expecting strong turnout for the Democratic primary in South Carolina on Saturday. In pre-election polls, Biden had more than 90% support. The nomination race has no drama. But people still have to vote. And the temperamental apparatus of elections has to prepare for that vote, even when it\u2019s not cast. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some people that come down here and really don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, and I try to help them,\u201d said Virgil Middleton, 74, a retired truck driver and marine veteran of the Vietnam war. He fought for democracy, he said, \u201cso that everybody can have a fair chance in the United States\u201d. Six poll workers trundled into the school gym at 6am, one of 2,351 precincts across the state, to snip the zip ties \u2013 marked with serial numbers \u2013 on the ballot box and fiddle with the polling terminals. They solemnly swore \u201cto preserve, protect and defend the constitution of this state and of the United States\u201d. Up before sunrise, all would return home after dark. Take-home pay for a poll worker is about $167 for the day, said Robert Samuel Jackson, a 74-year-old retiree in North Charleston. It\u2019s soldierly work. Four are military veterans. None are younger than 60.

Even when there are no differentials in power, when both parties are sober, willing, unaffected by gender roles, racial biases or societal pressures, there is always potential for human error and misinterpretation. This is especially problematic when getting explicit consent isn\u2019t just about pleasing your partner, but also about protecting yourself. This documentary makes it all too clear that is particularly the case when it comes to the dynamics of Black men and white women where, historically, Black men and boys have been viewed as more sexually voracious and predatory. In the deeply disturbing case of Derrick Johnson and Anna Stubblefield, we see the shocking way a non-verbal, disabled Black man\u2019s sexual abuse by his white carer could be contorted into an innocent act of misinterpretation.\n\nThe documentary Tell Them You Love Me, created by Louis Theroux\u2019s production company, takes on his signature anti-socratic method \u2013 which allows its subjects to explain themselves without interruption and occasionally hang themselves with their own rope. We hear the tale of Derrick Johnson, who had a series of seizures as a baby. By his older brother Dr John Johnson\u2019s account, as a toddler he was \u201cdiagnosed as mentally retarded, non-verbal with cerebral palsy\u201d. His father left the family soon afterwards but as Derrick grew into adulthood his devoted mother and brother believed him to be striving to communicate with them. The programme\u2019s twist in the tale comes when John begins his PhD at Rutgers University and watches Anna Stubblefield\u2019s lecture on non-verbal disabilities and thinks her methods could unlock hidden potential in his brother, unaware that Stubblefield would soon be having \u201cromantic\u201d and sexual relations with his sibling.\n\nWhile Tell Them You Love Me at first has a slightly dispassionate approach \u2013 with its subjects sticking to their versions of events \u2013 by the third act it begins to use the legal case to reveal wider truths about society\u2019s ingrained prejudice. The harrowing tale of abuse is made darker by the witnesses and experts who explain that Derrick may not have had agency to consent \u2013 and who are still unable to see this educated white middle-class woman as a perpetrator of sexual violence. Dr Howard Shane appears to explain how Derrick had the mental capacity of a six- to 12-month-old child and his typed consent given via his \u201ccommunication facilitator\u201d, Stubblefield, was just her \u201chaving conversations with herself\u201d. But he claims: \u201cI never thought she was a predator. She truly believed what she was doing was in Derrick\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Anna Stubblefield remains convinced she had a loving consensual relationship with Derrick Johnson. Photograph: Sky/\u00a9 Sky UK Limited\n\nEven assuming that this claim to be in love comes from delusion, there is a victim in the form of young Derrick Johnson. And it\u2019s hard to watch Dr John Johnson recount when he discovered during a nappy change that his brother had bruises, grazes and permanent scars all over his diminutive body from rough sex on a mat on Stubblefield\u2019s office floor. Stubblefield herself remains firm in her beliefs of a loving consensual relationship despite all evidence to the contrary. When asked if she ever had any doubts, she responds: \u201cNever.\u201d\n\nTell Them You Love Me\u2019s detailing of the way that facilitated communication for the non-verbal can be misconstrued is just as striking as a study in white privilege and white female victimhood \u2013 where good intentions are consistently assumed of Stubblefield. When Derrick\u2019s mother, Daisy, is told by Stubblefield that she is in \u201ca relationship\u201d with him \u2013 and he\u2019s now \u201ca man in every sense of the world\u201d \u2013 Daisy finds herself instinctively sitting on her hands lest she does something that could be used against her \u2013 causing her to be dismissed as an angry Black woman who doesn\u2019t understand what is best for her son. Meanwhile, Stubblefield perceives herself as so non-threatening that she is, even all these years later, unable to see why leaving messages for the Johnson family saying she will \u201csign my name in blood so I can be with Derrick\u201d could be interpreted as sinister.\n\nAside from the legal system, there is a distinct lack of people in the documentary holding Stubblefield to account. The notable exceptions are her ex-husband \u2013 who tells the court she is a \u201cpathological liar and narcissist\u201d \u2013 and the even-keeled Dr Johnson, who concludes: \u201cThat woman did not give a damn about my brother.\u201d What is fascinating about the documentary is how many topics it touches upon intelligently and sensitively in less than two hours. Beyond consent, disability and race there is space given to reflect upon the nature of language, the \u201cwhite saviour\u201d complex, the purpose of justice and what constitutes unconditional love. Tell Them You Love Me might be a hard watch, but it is also a vital one.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to What's On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It followed an air assault in Iraq and Syria on Friday targeting other Iran-backed militias and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in retaliation for the drone strike that killed three US troops \u2013 William Jerome Rivers, Kennedy Ladon Sanders and Breonna Alexsondria Moffett \u2013 in Jordan last weekend.\n\nThe US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the military action \u201csends a clear message to the Houthis that they will continue to bear further consequences if they do not end their illegal attacks on international shipping and naval vessels.\u201d\n\nThe Houthi targets were in 13 different locations and were struck by US F/A-18 fighter jets from the USS Dwight D Eisenhower aircraft carrier, by British Typhoon FGR4 fighter aircraft and by the destroyers USS Gravely and the USS Carney firing Tomahawk missiles from the Red Sea, according to US officials and the UK defence ministry. The US officials were not authorised to publicly discuss the military operation and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nSaturday\u2019s strikes marked the third time the US and Britain had conducted a large, joint operation to strike Houthi launchers, radar sites and drones. But the Houthis have made it clear that they have no intention of scaling back their assault.\n\nOn Friday, the US destroyer Laboon and F/A-18s from the Eisenhower shot down seven drones launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen into the Red Sea; the destroyer Carney also shot down a drone fired in the Gulf of Aden and US forces took out four more drones that were prepared to launch.\n\nHours before the latest joint operation, the US undertook another self-defence strike on a site in Yemen, destroying six anti-ship cruise missiles, as it has repeatedly when it has detected a missile or drone ready to launch.\n\nThe US warned that its response after the soldiers\u2019 deaths at the Tower 22 base in Jordan last Sunday would not be limited to one night, one target or one group. While there has been no suggestion the Houthis were directly responsible, they have been one of the prime US adversaries since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages.\n\nThe Houthis have been conducting almost daily missile or drone attacks against commercial and military ships transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and they have made clear that they have no intention of scaling back despite pressure from the American and British campaign.\n\nMohammed al-Bukhaiti, a Houthi official, said \u201cmilitary operations against Israel will continue until the crimes of genocide in Gaza are stopped and the siege on its residents is lifted, no matter the sacrifices it costs us.\u201d He wrote online that the \u201cAmerican-British aggression against Yemen will not go unanswered, and we will meet escalation with escalation\u201d.\n\nThe Biden administration has indicated that this is likely not the last of its strikes. The US has blamed the Jordan attack on the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of Iranian-backed militias. Iran has tried to distance itself from the drone strike, saying the militias act independently of its direction.\n\nAustin said the military action, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, \u201csends a clear message to the Houthis that they will continue to bear further consequences if they do not end their illegal attacks on international shipping and naval vessels\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world\u2019s most critical waterways.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon said the strikes targeted sites associated with the Houthis\u2019 deeply buried weapons storage facilities, missile systems and launchers, air defence, radars and helicopters. The British military said it struck a ground control station west of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana\u2019a, that has been used to control Houthi drones that have launched against vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nThe US president, Joe Biden, was briefed on the strikes before he left Delaware on Saturday for a west coast campaign trip, according to an administration official.\n\nThe strikes in Yemen are meant to underscore the broader message to Iran that Washington holds Tehran responsible for arming, funding and training the array of militias \u2013 from Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and the Houthis in Yemen \u2013 who are behind attacks across the Middle East against US and international interests.\n\nVideo shared online by people in Sana\u2019a included the sound of explosions and at least one blast was seen lighting up the night sky. Residents described the blasts as happening around buildings associated with the Yemeni presidential compound. The Houthi-controlled news agency Saba reported strikes in al-Bayda, Dhamar, Hajjah, Hodeida, Taiz and Sana\u2019a provinces.\n\nThe Houthis\u2019 attacks have led shipping companies to reroute their vessels from the Red Sea, sending them around Africa through the Cape of Good Hope \u2013 a much longer, costlier and less efficient passage. The threats also have led the US and its allies to set up a joint mission where warships from participating nations provide a protective umbrella of air defense for ships as they travel the critical waterway that runs from the Suez Canal down to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait.\n\nDuring normal operations about 400 commercial vessels transit the southern Red Sea at any given time.\n\nIn the wake of the strikes on Friday in Iraq and Syria, Hussein al-Mosawi, spokesperson for Harakat al-Nujaba, one of the main Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, said Washington \u201cmust understand that every action elicits a reaction\u201d. But in an AP interview in Baghdad, he also struck a more conciliatory tone. \u201cWe do not wish to escalate or widen regional tensions,\u201d he said.\n\nIraqi officials have attempted to rein in the militias, while also condemning US retaliatory strikes as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and calling for an exit of the 2,500 US troops who are in Iraq as part of an international coalition to fight Islamic State. In January, Iraqi and US military officials launched formal talks to wind down the coalition\u2019s presence, a process that likely to take years."}

As a child, he sang along to soul music on the radio before switching over to the bass.\n\nHe built his first bass guitar from scratch using plywood, a curtain rod and an old ashtray. In a 2007 interview with Bass Player magazine, he said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m playing the bass, it\u2019s like I\u2019m singing. I compose a melodic line and see myself like I\u2019m singing baritone.\u201d\n\nAlong with his brother Carlton, Barrett played with groups including Bob Marley & the Wailers, the Hippy Boys and Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry\u2019s The Upsetters. He was also a mentor to many Jamaican musicians including Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare of the reggae production duo Sly & Robbie.\n\nAfter joining the Wailers in the 1970s, Barrett became bandleader of Marley\u2019s backing band and co-producer of the group\u2019s albums. He remained a member for the rest of Marley\u2019s life, contributing to the much-loved albums Burnin\u2019 and Uprising, among others.\n\nBut his legacy stretched much further: he continued to tour with later iterations of the Wailers and, in 2015, he was named the 25th greatest bassist of all time by NME readers. In 2021, he was honoured with the Order of Distinction (Commander class) in the National Honours and Awards on Jamaica\u2019s 59th Anniversary of Independence.\n\nIn his 2007 Bass Player feature, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve played before Bob, with Bob, and after Bob and along the way I create a whole new concept of bass playing. That\u2019s just my thing. That\u2019s my destiny.\u201d\n\nGrange\u2019s update also expressed her support for the family of the \u201cpioneer of Jamaican music\u201d. She said: \u201cAs we commemorate Reggae Month 2024, I wish to express my sincere condolences to his wife, his children, his relatives and to members of the local and international reggae music fraternity. May the angels welcome home Aston \u201cFamily Man\u201d Barrett to Mount Zion.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, Barrett entered a legal battle with Island Records, claiming \u00a360m in unpaid royalties for his production and songwriting work on the albums, but his campaign was unsuccessful. He retired from music in 2019.\n\nThe news of Barrett\u2019s death comes less than two weeks before the release of Bob Marley: One Love, the biopic of Marley in which Barrett will be played by his son, Aston Barrett Jr."}

It shows how far we\u2019ve come, to be able to fight and win those games. It is a bit of a monkey off our backs. We\u2019ve got France next, but there\u2019s a lot to work on, which is a positive place to be.\u201d\n\nTheir opponents played like men inspired in the second half, but they were an inexperienced team, led by the second youngest captain in Wales\u2019s history. There was, though, no let-up in intensity from the Cardiff crowd.\n\n\u201cIt shows what the atmosphere and crowd here can do, but we got back to how we can play and we managed to dig it out in the end. Credit to Wales, it\u2019s what we expected, but it\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to be better at. I\u2019m disappointed with that second half but it\u2019s a great start to the tournament, our first win here for 22 years.\u201d\n\nFor the young captain opposite him, Dafydd Jenkins, the experience was similarly bittersweet. \u201cI was incredibly proud of the boys in the second half,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously we were not as accurate in the first half. We showed them too much respect. My family are incredibly proud, but it doesn\u2019t really mean anything if you\u2019re not winning.\u201d\n\nHis coach, Warren Gatland, could not cut a more contrasting figure when it comes to experience. He knew that was always going to be the key challenge for his side.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t coach experience,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s 75,000 people out there making that noise and there\u2019s a bit of pressure, pace and intensity, a little more than you\u2019re used to at club rugby, it takes time to get used to that. So we\u2019ll need a little bit of leeway, but this is still international rugby and it\u2019s still really important and it\u2019s about winning.

They file a report and hope for the best.\n\nBut on Jan. 23, Olinger got a pretty unique call that compelled him to do more.\n\nJae Ingram was hosting a birthday party for her 4-year-old Syris around 6:00 p.m. that day at a trampoline park in Huber Heights, a suburb of Dayton. But Ingram accidentally left her car door unlocked and someone went into her car and stole her son\u2019s birthday gifts.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of one of those things where yeah, you can take a report but the kid\u2019s birthday is obviously not going as well as she had planned,\u201d Olinger said.\n\nHe called Sanchez and the two went to a local Walgreens to buy some replacement gifts for the kiddo. They got him all kinds of Paw Patrol toys and cars, he said.\n\nThe boy\u2019s mom shared Ring footage of the kind act on Facebook that night. In the short but sweet clip, an excited Syris thanks the officers enthusiastically.\n\nIngram said in her post that she felt like the worst mom ever when her son\u2019s gifts were stolen. She never leaves her car doors unlocked but did so by mistake that night. The officers\u2019 kind act made her son\u2019s day though, she told USA TODAY. She said other community members also replaced the specific toys stolen from Syris that day.\n\n\u201cI just can't thank them enough,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother told USA TODAY.\n\nMom called Walmart to warn them about stolen toys\n\nIngram said she took Syris to Walmart to get a few toys for his birthday that day. After that, they went to an indoor trampoline park for no more than 30 minutes.\n\nThe family then went to grab dinner at Taco Bell and headed home. That\u2019s when Syris noticed one of his toys, a Chase car from \u201cPaw Patrol,\u201d was missing.\n\n\u201cOne of the toys was a big Sonic remote control car,\u201d said his mother. \u201cA huge box, so there's no way I'm missing this in my car. It's gone.\u201d\n\nThey drove back to the trampoline park to ask if they have cameras pointing at the vehicles in the parking lot but were told they only have cameras near the entrance.\n\nShe reported the gifts stolen and then headed home. That\u2019s when the officers showed up.\n\nShe also called Walmart to let them know her toys were stolen and someone may be trying to return them for cash.\n\nOfficers grew up in community and wanted to help victimized child\n\nOlinger and Sanchez both grew up in the Ohio community where they now serve as police officers. Doing something kind for the 4 year old whose birthday was ruined was a no-brainer.\n\n\u201cI felt sad but I was excited to actually be able to have an opportunity to do something for this young man,\u201d Olinger said. \u201cWe just pretty much went over to the nearest Walgreens I could find and grabbed all the Paw Patrol things I could find.\u201d\n\nThey then headed to his house to deliver the gifts. It all happened within 30 minutes. He said the excitement the boy showed when he saw the presents was touching.\n\nHe said so often, police officers are told not to relate work experiences to his own family. In this case, he thought of his daughter and empathy led him to do something other than file a report.\n\n\u201cI like to make her birthdays perfect,\u201d Olinger said, adding that he thought about how his birthday \u201cfell short of that and what we could do to make it better.\u201d\n\nSanchez, who helped pick out gifts and delivered them to the boy, said he was ecstatic to be part of it.\n\n\u201cHe just had all his birthday presents stolen and then we showed up,\u201d he said. \u201cHis mood went from 0 to 100.\u201d\n\nThe duo said it\u2019s an honor to be part of their local police force, patrolling the very streets their own families travel day and night.\n\n\u201cThese are the types of things that a lot of our officers do very commonly and they don't always get the attention that this necessarily got,\u201d Olinger said.\n\nBirthday boy is his mother\u2019s \u2018Sour Patch Kid\u2019\n\nIngram said the birthday boy, Syris, is part of an active and growing family.\n\nShe has him, 5-year-old Steven, a baby boy she lost in May and she is currently expecting another baby boy, due on March 18.\n\nSyris is super outgoing and polite but \u201cdefinitely my Sour Patch Kid,\u201d she told USA TODAY.\n\n\u201cHe gives me a run for my money but he also has great manners and he can light up a room,\u201d she said.\n\nHe was thrilled to receive the gifts from the officers. She knew she had to post the video of the officers delivering the gifts because it\u2019s such a rare act.\n\n\u201cSome officers would just be like \u2018We're so sorry that happened to you \u2026 There's nothing we can do.\u201d"}

The alleged incident occurred in 2018 after a Hockey Canada gala in London, Ontario, that honored members of the gold-medal-winning world junior championship team.\n\nPolice will hold a news conference at 2 p.m. ET Monday to offer details of their investigation.\n\nNHL commissioner Gary Bettman addressed the issue Friday, saying the \"alleged behavior\" was \"abhorrent.\" But he said the league would let the judicial proceedings play out before deciding a response. He and deputy commissioner Bill Daly said the league would not release the findings of an independent 12-month investigation while the case is ongoing.\n\nHere are pressing questions for the NHL stretch drive:\n\nWill the Edmonton Oilers set the record for consecutive wins?\n\nWhat's more surprising: that the Oilers are on a 16-game winning streak or that they opened the season 2-9-1? A coaching change from Jay Woodcroft to Kris Knoblauch and the addition of Hall of Famer Paul Coffey to coach the defense has made the difference. The Oilers have given up only 24 goals during the streak.\n\nThe Oilers can tie the 1992-93 Pittsburgh Penguins' record winning streak on Tuesday at the Vegas Golden Knights, the team that knocked them out of the playoffs last season. If they get past the defending champions, they can break the record on Friday at Anaheim. They've outscored the Ducks 15-4 over two games this season.\n\nThe last time the Oilers made a midseason coaching change (to Woodcroft), they reached the conference final.\n\nWho will win the scoring race?\n\nIt certainly has been exciting with current leader Nikita Kucherov (Tampa Bay Lightning) and Colorado Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon, one point behind, seemingly trying to top each other every night. One will have a big game and be matched by the other. MacKinnon is working on a 13-game point streak (28 points) and Kucherov averaged two points a game in January. MacKinnon is much better at home and his team is going on a six-game road trip. Kucherov has similar numbers at home and on the road. This could go to the end of the regular season. They'll face each other on Feb. 15 in Tampa.\n\nWho could be moved before the trade deadline?\n\nThe deadline is March 8. Calgary's Elias Lindholm and Montreal's Sean Monahan just got traded. Calgary's Noah Hanifin and Chris Tanev could move as well. Pittsburgh Penguins general manager Kyle Dubas is sizing up his team. If he decides to sell, pending unrestricted agent Jake Guentzel would fetch a good price. The Ducks, Sharks, Blackhawks, Senators and rebuilding Flyers could also be sellers.\n\nCan Alex Ovechkin get back on track in Wayne Gretzky goal record chase?\n\nThe Washington Capitals star needs to score 24.3 goals a season to pass Gretzky's record in the remaining two-plus seasons of his contract but is on pace for about 16. He had a career-worst 14-game drought and had another eight-game drought surrounding a three-game injury absence. He did score his ninth goal right before the break and will be rested, but in his career, his goals-per-game numbers have dropped slightly after the All-Star break.\n\nCan Connor Bedard win rookie of the year?\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks 2023 No. 1 overall pick was a front-runner before suffering a broken jaw on Jan. 5. He still holds the rookie scoring lead but Minnesota Wild defenseman Brock Faber is closing in while playing big minutes. Bedard made a surprise appearance at All-Star weekend, passing pucks for the one-timer contest. He told Sportsnet he was feeling better but still needs time to heal. His timeline for returning is late February to early March. If he returns then and goes back to his pre-injury pace, he should be able to finish the season as the top-scoring rookie.\n\nWhich 2022-23 non-playoff teams can make 2024 postseason?\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks are tied for the league's best record. The St. Louis Blues hold the final spot in the West and the Nashville Predators and Arizona Coyotes are five points back. In the East, the Philadelphia Flyers hold a spot but lost five in a row heading into the break. The Detroit Red Wings have played better this season and sit in the final wild-card spot. Outside the Canucks, none of them are a sure thing."}

They were the first Black military aviators in what was then the equivalent of the Air Force. They fought during World War II and might be the most brilliant aviators in the history of combat flying. They were nicknamed the \"red tails\" because of the red markings on the tail of their fighter craft.\n\nThe group inspired countless Black Americans to pursue flying ... including me. I'd get my pilot's license, followed by an instrument rating (which allows you to legally fly in the clouds), and have flown a number of single engine aircraft, mostly the Cessna 152 and 172 RG.\n\nFlying is one of the greatest examples of the power of possibilities. The sky is literally one big, blue dream. That's what makes Charlie Kirk's racist lie so problematic.\n\nKirk has almost three million followers on X, formerly Twitter. He has a significant amount of impact, and he used that power to try and destroy those dreams. He's not alone. The extreme right, for some weird reason, has recently focused on DEI in commercial flying.\n\nMost of it is the usual anti-Black stuff, but Kirk went to a far uglier place when he said: \"If I see a Black pilot, I'm going to be like, 'Boy, I hope he's qualified.'\"\n\nOne of the more sinister things about white supremacy is that it constantly tries to snuff out the dreams of non-white people. Cast doubt on us. Tell us that we're not good enough.\n\nWhat's important to remember is that people like Kirk will always be there. In the background. Lying. Or trying to crush dreams. When that happens, remember that he can't. Remember that the Tuskegee Airmen fought far worse racism and were still the best pilots in the world.\n\nThey never forgot something: the power of a dream."}

They are the ones worn around waists.\n\n\u201cThe NFL has made this a priority,\u201d Izell Reese, the executive director of NFL FLAG, told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nNFL Pro Bowl participants will play the flag version of football Sunday for the second consecutive year. Prior to that contest, the league once again hosted the International NFL Flag Championships \u2014 featuring teams from 12 countries \u2014 Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt just shows the full range of what flag football is,\u201d said NFL international flag football development and youth marketing manager Afia Law said.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nOlympic impact on NFL's flag football efforts\n\nFlag football received its biggest vote of satisfaction in the fall when the Los Angeles 2028 Summer Olympic committee announced the inclusion of the sport on the program. Whether NFL stars will participate is a question that will be worked out over the coming year, NFL vice president of football development Roman Oben said. Those discussions are still developing.\n\nMore:NFL's flag football championships come to USA.\n\n\u201cWhen you say the tackle football side is taking flag seriously as a growth sport, as a good layer of participation for future players and future plans, I think that's a step in the right direction in terms of where the NFL belongs in the discussion,\u201d Oben told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nYoung people having a stage to which they can aspire is what will continue to drive the growth of flag, Reese said.\n\n\u201cI think it establishes the sport of football \u2014 in this case, flag \u2014 and puts it on another level,\u201d Reese said.\n\nKids across the world, the NFL hopes, can play in the park with friends or on the blacktop at school while having the option to pursue a more competitive path all the way to the Olympics.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s given us something that young people in the sport have wanted for some time, and it now presents that full pathway,\u201d Law said.\n\n'These girls can be pioneers':Why flag football is becoming so popular with kids\n\nWill NFL players play flag football in Olympics?\n\nOben expects by early 2025 key stakeholders \u2014 owners, players\u2019 union and the International Olympic Committee \u2014 would have at least established a clear path of communication to decide whether NFL players can participate. The Olympic schedule means competition would take place during training camp. There is the obvious injury risk.\n\nAlso: there would have to be some sort of selection process, similar to how USA Basketball evaluates NBA and WNBA stars.\n\n\u201cYou have to try out for the Olympics,\u201d Oben said.\n\nDifferent skills, rules \u2014 and a lesser barrier to entry\n\nFlag football is a sport within itself, Law said. It is speedier, more agile and is played on a smaller field compared to the tackle version. Flag also has more co-ed possibilities. Size and strength are secondary attributes.\n\nHelmets and shoulder pads are also unnecessary.\n\n\u201cGiven that ease of getting equipment \u2014 flag belts and footballs \u2014 enables young people to try something they may not otherwise get to try,\u201d Law said. \u201cSo I think it helps massively.\u201d\n\nFlag is feasible, while tackle may be impossible in some places domestic or abroad. Being able to just play without the additional effort of acquiring equipment eases the transition \u201cespecially in certain parts of the world where there are more barriers to enter sport,\u201d Law said.\n\nThere are no offensive or defensive lines. Players have the ability to \u201cfind their skill and what they\u2019re good at and what they contribute to the team,\u201d Law said. And that allows all individuals to have their own unique football journeys, Oben said.\n\n\u201cWe live in an era where recreational sports are marginalized if you\u2019re not on some travel team by fourth grade \u2026 from a flag football perspective, we take all comers,\u201d he said.\n\nInternational and domestic growth\n\nAll 32 NFL clubs have flag initiatives within their markets and have started expanding their growth internationally, Oben said.\n\nNFL FLAG is the largest organized flag league in the world. There were 300,000 members in 2019 and that number has jumped to 700,000 now. There are adult leagues and divisions for children as young as five. Eight states \u2014 Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Californian, Florida, Georgia, Nevada and New York \u2014 have sanctioned girls\u2019 flag football as a varsity sport, while the NCAA sanctioning process is underway (it has already been approved by the NAIA and junior colleges).\n\n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s been a lot of groundswell growth,\u201d Reese said.\n\nIn Mexico, 100,000 new players came to flag in 2022. Japan has included flag football in the national curriculum of its elementary schools. Nearly 200,000 children play in China\u2019s schools. The sport is gaining traction in Caribbean countries, Reese said, like the Bahamas.\n\n\u201cExcitement from the community backyard,\u201d Oben explained, \u201cto being played in the Olympics one day.\u201d"}

Walk.\n\nA walk is the colloquial term for a base on balls in baseball scoring.\n\nBoth mean the same, both serve the same purpose. Both are non-Sabermetric statistics.\n\nA base on balls, or walk, happens when a pitcher throws four pitches out of the strike zone during an at bat and the batter is awarded first base without the possibility of being called out.\n\nThere's a saying in baseball where a walk is just as good as a hit.

The pitcher no longer has to throw four pitches out of the strike zone to walk the batter like in the past. Instead, the manager can simply signal that he wants the batter walked, and the batter automatically goes to first base without a pitch being thrown. Why? In 2017, MLB changed the rules to speed up the pace of play.\n\nHow is walk denoted in a baseball scorebook?\n\nIn the scorebook, a walk is denoted by the letters 'BB,' which stands for base on balls.

Here's when to be concerned", "domain": "usatoday.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMI7D-wowkqT0Ag", "text": "Among the many developmental milestones that new parents look out for, few are as highly anticipated as their baby's first words. Despite some gibberish preceding actual language, a baby's earliest attempts at verbal communication and their first words are often documented and remembered by mom or dad long after the baby clothes and swaddling blankets get stored away.\n\nAccording to one news report, the most common of all first words in American English are a variation of \"mommy\" or \"daddy,\" followed by \"ball,\" \"hi,\" \"no,\" and \"dog.\" As exciting as it is to hear these and other words for the first time, some parents worry if their child doesn't seem to be speaking as much or as early as other babies and whether a checkup with the family pediatrician might be in order.\n\nWhen do babies start talking?\n\nThe first thing to understand is that the timing of first words vary from baby to baby. \"There is a range of normal development and some babies may start talking earlier or later than others,\" explains Dr. Alison Mitzner, a board-certified pediatrician and author of \"Calm and Confident Parenting.\"\n\nSome children are genetically predisposed to start speaking earlier than other children and some babies are also impacted by their environment and whether they have young siblings they want to imitate. Research shows that a parent who talks especially often can also influence a baby to want to do the same.\n\nRegardless of what encourages speech to develop in each child, \"babies usually start talking in single words around 12 months and in 2-word phrases around 18 months,\" says Dr. Michael Yogman, a pediatrician and primary care physician at Cambridge Pediatrics and an assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.\n\nIt's also worth noting that these early words are usually distinguishable and vary from the use of sounds and other early forms of verbal communication parents witness in their baby as early as the first months after they're born.\n\nEarly signs that words could become intelligible include a baby babbling as if talking in sentences or combining certain sounds with facial expressions or gestures that indicate a child is trying express a specific frustration or desire. \"If your baby is babbling with pointing and gesturing, your baby is still communicating,\" says Mitzner.\n\nWhen should I be worried my baby isn't talking?\n\nThough timing of first words and other forms of communication does vary for these reasons, at a certain point a baby not speaking can be a sign of impaired hearing or developmental delays. \"When children are not saying any words by the age of 18-24 months, parents can discuss their concerns with a pediatrician,\" says Dr. Jason Nagata, a pediatrician at UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital in San Francisco. \"A pediatrician can check for hearing loss or assess language delays and refer the family to a speech therapist or a specialist in developmental and behavioral pediatrics, if needed.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that such recommendations follow a baby not saying any distinguishable words by that time. Before then, a parent doesn't usually need to be concerned over a baby not saying many words. \"By the age of 1, most babies can say one or two simple words, but the vocabulary can really vary widely,\" offers Mitzner. She explains that some children may only repeat the same few words while others may have a more extensive vocabulary. \"It's important to focus on the progress and consistency in language development rather than the exact number of words,\" she explains.\n\nWhat determines what word a baby says first?\n\nAlso of interest is why babies say the first words they do and whether there's anything parents can do to help once a baby starts talking. Nagata says that babies are excellent imitators, so their first words are usually the ones they hear repeated often or said at them a lot. Mitzner echoes that babies usually start with talking about objects or people they associate with regularly. \"There's a reason so many babies' first words are 'mama' and 'dada,'\" she explains. \"These are usually the people they spend the most time with who are meaningful to them.\"\n\nOther factors include babies learning to associate specific words with things they want or don't want - think how often these early words are \"no\" and \"ball,\" for instance. Another factor is simply which words are easiest for babies to say.\n\nOnce baby does start talking, parents can encourage them by showing they understand and by spending more time focusing on word/object associations discovered in books and everyday life interactions. \"Reading and talking together can be reassuring and help babies make progress with their language,\" says Yogman.\n\nWhen do babies start crawling?There's no hard and fast rule but here's when to be worried."}

Curacao is led by several MLB veterans in Jurickson Profar, Didi Gregorius, Jonathan Schoop and Andrelton Simmons.\n\nFormer World Series champion manager Ozzie Guilen is managing Tiburones de la Guaira of Venezuela while future Hall of Famer Yadier Molina is managing Criollos of Puerto Rico. Nicaragua is making its first Caribbean appearance with former San Francisco Giants outfielder Marvin Benard managing the Gigantes de Rivas.\n\nYet, one man who should be basking in the limelight as the godfather of this celebration of baseball is not there.\n\nHe may be more responsible than anyone for the dominance of Latino ballplayers across the MLB landscape.\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\nHis name is Ralph Avila.\n\nAvila, who engineered the rich pipeline of Caribbean baseball talent and was baseball\u2019s inaugural international scout of the year, died a year ago at this time at the age of 92.\n\nBut, oh, what a legacy he left, and is being demonstrated throughout this Caribbean Series.\n\n\u201cMy dad would have loved being here,\" said Ralph\u2019s son, Al Avila, the former executive vice president and GM of the Detroit Tigers, only the third Latino GM in baseball history. \u201cHe loved the Caribbean Series. It meant so much to him.\"\n\nRalph Avila was a living legend for 55 years with the Los Angeles Dodgers, signing Hall of Famers Pedro Martinez and Adrian Beltre. Martinez was so indebted to Avila that he personally brought him to his Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2015 and Beltre shared what he meant to him following his election last week.\n\n\u201cRight away I have to thank Rafael Avila, the man with the biggest history as far as ballplayers coming out of the Dominican Republic,\u201d Martinez said during his Hall of Fame speech. \u201cJust if you didn't know, that's Rafael Avila over here, my first mentor and my papaito that signed more than 50 players that have made it to the big leagues. Rafael Avila, an icon of Latin America, and a symbol of baseball in the Dominican Republic.\u201d\n\nLas Avila was instrumental in more than 25 players reaching the big leagues alone from the Dodgers\u2019 historic Dominican Republic academy, Campo Las Palmas, and hundreds of others going advancing thanks to Avila\u2019s academy. He also helped establish the Dominican Summer League.\n\n\u201cNot everyone made the big leagues, but my dad\u2019s belief was that if you teach them, and educate them,\" Al Avila said, \u201cthey can get jobs whether in baseball or something else, living a productive everyday life. My dad and Manny Mota had to teach everything, not just the game, but everything, I mean how to use the bathroom, hygiene, and all the very basics in life. It was really phenomenal.\n\n\u201cHe taught them the English language, the difference in culture, and really how to survive in the United States.\"\n\nThose same former players and professionals would stop by Avila\u2019s Miami-area home when he was struggling with dementia, and spent the entire day with him, talking baseball, and letting Avila know what he meant to him.\n\nReally, Avila is as responsible as anyone for the Dodgers\u2019 rich success, hired originally by Al Campanis as a scout, only to become Hall of Fame manager Tommy Lasorda\u2019s right-hand man, a valued confidant to owner Peter O\u2019Malley, and the man who personally planned and helped build the Dodgers\u2019 legendary academy. It was the first academy built in the Dominican Republic. Now, every team has an academy.\n\n\u201cHe literally found the land, cleared the sugar cane, planted the trees and dragged the infield in the camp\u2019s early days,\" Dodgers CEO Stan Kasten said when they spent $8 million to renovate the complex in 2017.\n\nSaid Al Avila: \u201cI remember going to the camp with him at the very beginning. We built the bullpens. We built the warning tracks. The pitching mounds. He brought in and planted a lot of trees himself. It was unbelievable.\n\n\u201cLook at the impact it made.\"\n\nThere were only 24 Dominican players in major league baseball before Avila became a scout. There were 103 Dominican-born players on opening-day rosters alone last year, and 269 players born internationally.\n\nAvila was so instrumental in the Dominican that he was even knighted by the Dominican president for his role in advancing baseball in the country.\n\nAvila, born in his native Cuba in 1930 where he was a semi-pro baseball player, certainly had quite the fascinating life. He was a revolutionary in Cuba where he was part of a militant workers group that sought to overtake Fulgencio Batista, and then an anti-revolutionary when Fidel Castro was leading the charge. He fled to the United States in 1961, and participated in the ill-fated Bay of Pigs in 1962.\n\nAvila never returned to Cuba again, with no relatives left in Cuba.\n\n\u201cHe refused to go back to Cuba,\u2019\u2019 Avila said. \u201cYou would have had to kill my dad to go back to Cuba. Once he learned the truth that [Fidel] Castro was a communist dictator, he knew he had to leave.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard for him to talk about.\"\n\nNow this proud family hopes that folks remember just what Avila meant with the Caribbean Series being played in his hometown. Al Avila was instrumental in the Florida Marlins\u2019 World Series championship run in 1997 as Dave Dombrowski\u2019s assistant GM, and his son, Alex, had a 13-year career as an All-Star catcher.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the 2011 All-Star gala with Ralph Avila, Al Avila and Alex Avila together when Alex was an All-Star with the Tigers, finishing 12th in the MVP race.\n\nAnd Al Avila says he\u2019ll never forget the night he got the phone call that Alex was being promoted to the big leagues for his major-league debut. Ralph and his wife happened to be visiting in Detroit at the same time, but were headed to the airport when Al got word about Alex\u2019s debut.\n\n\u201cI was so excited, I called them in the car to come back,\" Al Avila said. \u201cBut my dad, he couldn\u2019t do it. He was shaking. He was scared. The emotion that came over him was too much. So they flew home.\"\n\nNo matter.\n\nThe memories are still vivid, with Al Avila still relishing the days he would be driving with his dad and Lasorda in the car together, talking about everything that is right and wrong with the game.\n\n\u201cWe always talked about the game, but to be in the car with those two, with every other word an F-bomb, talking about his player or that game,\" Avila said, \u201cwas something I\u2019ll never forget. Oh, and the arguments that would ensue. They were legendary, really.\n\n\u201cThis is a special time with the Caribbean Series being in Miami, but more than anything, I\u2019m hoping my dad will be remembered for just what he meant to so many people.\"\n\nWillie Mays Day celebrates 'Say Hey Kid' on 2/4/24\n\nOn Feb. 4, the city of San Francisco and the Giants are celebrating the great Willie Mays.\n\nThe numerical anomaly was simply too good to pass up: 2/4/24, Mays\u2019 former number.\n\nCity Hall will be illuminated in orange and black and the Oracle Park scoreboard will commemorate the occasion.\n\n\u201cI am honored by Mayor Breed\u2019s proclamation, and would like to thank the City of San Francisco and the Giants for this day,\u201d Mays, 92, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe game of baseball has been great to me, and not only was I given the opportunity to play, but I was also given the opportunity to help kids all around the world. To me, this day means I am loved. This is as much my day as it is for everyone who loves the game.\u201d\n\nIt will be quite the year for May with the Giants scheduled to play the St. Louis Cardinals at Rickwood Field in June, honoring the history of the Negro Leagues. Mays played at Rickwood Field for the Birmingham Black Barons before the Giants signed him out of high school in 1950.\n\n\u201cOur National Pastime always welcomes the opportunity to celebrate the game\u2019s greatest living player, Willie Mays,\u201d MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said. \u201cMajor League Baseball applauds the San Francisco Giants and the City of San Francisco for honoring the best number 24 of all in grand fashion. To this day, Willie remains an inspiration to sports fans and baseball players everywhere. We look forward to highlighting Willie\u2019s legacy at the MLB at Rickwood Field Game in his hometown of Birmingham this June 20th.\u201d\n\nAround the basepaths\n\n\u2013 Several executives think the Philadelphia Phillies could be a sleeper for one of the remaining marquee free agents in starter Jordan Montgomery or center fielder Cody Bellinger. Their lone big move has been re-signing Aaron Nola, and Bellinger certainly would provide Gold Glove-caliber defense and another bat to balance the lineup. Montgomery would strengthen the top of the rotation.\n\nYet, unless their price-tags drop, the Phillies plan to remain patient.\n\n\u2013 Several MLB owners say they were stunned the Orioles were sold for only $1.72 billion, believing the Angelos family would have received much more if they had opened the bidding to other bidders. The sale was a major surprise to most MLB executives.\n\n\u2013 The perfect fit for DH J.D. Martinez, GMs say, are the Cleveland Guardians, who have spent just $1.1 million this winter.\n\n\u2013 GMs say that no team improved their offense more this winter than the Seattle Mariners with their acquisitions of Jorge Polanco, Mitch Garver, Mitch Haniger and Luke Raley.\n\n\u2013 The Chicago White Sox believe that the Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 return of young lefty D.L. Hall and shortstop Joey Ortiz for Corbin Burnes should be the floor in what they should receive in return for ace Dylan Cease.\n\nThe Orioles offered basically the same package for Cease, along with another player. Cease, who is earning $8 million this season, however has two years of control compared to Burnes\u2019 one season.\n\n\u2013 Now that spring training is beginning this week in Arizona with the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, executives and agents believe there will be an absolute flurry of free-agent activity.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Cody Bellinger, Blake Snell, Matt Chapman, and Jordan Montgomery will sign this week, but there should be dozens of others who are getting antsy and need to quickly find a home.\n\nThere have been less than 80 players who have signed major-league free agent contracts this winter in this slow market.\n\nThe Dodgers still have spent nearly more money this winter ($1.073 billion) than the rest of the 29 teams ($1.25 billion).\n\nThere are eight teams who have spent less than $10 million in free agency while just four teams have spent more than $100 million: the Dodgers ($1.073 billion), the Phillies ($173 million), the Giants ($165 million) and the Astros ($107 million).\n\n\u2013 Now that the Giants have cleared $9.25 million in payroll by trading starter Ross Stripling to the Oakland A\u2019s (paying $3.25 million of Stripling\u2019s $12.5 million salary), it certainly could help land third baseman Matt Chapman or another marquee free agent.\n\n\u2013 The Minnesota Twins, after saving $5.5 million in the Polanco trade with Seattle, turned around look set to sign first baseman Carlos Santana on a one-year, $5.25 million contract.\n\n\u2013 While the Orioles hated to part with their 2024 Competitive Balance Round A pick, No. 34 overall, in the Corbin Burnes trade, remember they will recoup the loss when they make a qualifying offer to Burnes after the season and receive a 2025 draft picks. The Orioles also already have the No. 22 and No. 32 selections this summer.\n\n\u2013 The Milwaukee Brewers are letting teams know that shortstop Willy Adames is available now that they have defensive whiz Joey Ortiz from the Orioles. They could also trade Adames at the deadline or simply let him walk as a free agent next winter.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to say,\" Brewers GM Matt Arnold said. \u201cAs we've discussed in the past, sometimes these deals come together very quickly and in other cases, they take a long time. I'm certainly open to more conversations. I certainly wouldn't shut any conversations down at this point in the offseason.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2013 The Los Angeles Dodgers knocked $4 million off starter James Paxton\u2019s guarantee after getting the results of his physical. Paxton, who originally was guaranteed $11 million, now is guaranteed $7 million. He can still make a total of $13 million with incentives.\n\n\u2013 Kudos to Major League Baseball for stepping up and helping replace the stolen and dismantled Jackie Robinson statue that was erected in 2021 in Wichita, Kansas., at their local youth baseball league. MLB also has agreed to provide funding to League 42 programming to support its on-field and academic goals.\n\nThe bronze statue was stolen, dismantled, and then burnt in the disgusting hate crime.\n\n\u2013 The New York Mets have had a quiet offseason, but wound up spending less than $12 million for three relievers in Adam Ottavino, Jake Diekman and Shintaro Fujinami simply by staying patient.\n\nOttavino actually cost himself more than $2 million by rejecting his $6.75 million player option and signing for $4.5 million.\n\n\u2013 The Orioles tried to re-sign outfielder Aaron Hicks before he chose the Los Angeles Angels. The Angels have to pay him just the league minimum of $740,000 while the Yankees are responsible for paying him $8.76 million this year, and $9.5 million in 2025.\n\n\u2013 It was no surprise that Adrian Beltre chose to wear the Texas Rangers logo as he\u2019s inducted this summer into the Hall of Fame while manager Jim Leyland is going without a team logo, knowing he could not offend either the Detroit Tigers or Pittsburgh Pirates. He also won a World Series with the Florida Marlins.\n\n\u201cI will always appreciate the team that gave me the opportunity to be their major league manager,\u2019\u2019 said Leyland, who also managed the Colorado Rockies. \u201cWe had some great moments with every one of thsioe ballclubs, and I\u2019m proud that they will be mentioned on my Hall of Fame plaque. I want to make suer I show each of thise teams respect, and this does that.\u2019\u2019\n\nBeltre on his decision: \u201cLooking back, I played more years in Texas than anywhere else and I believe my time with the Rangers represents the peak of my career, individually and from a team standppint. But I could not have made this journey to Cooperstown without the Los Angeles Dodgers, Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox and their fans, and I am proud that each of the teams I played with will be listed on my Hall of Fame plaque.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2013 The Oakland A\u2019s are clearing their way for their new $1.5 billion ballpark in Las Vegas with the Tropicana Hotel now scheduled to shut down on April 2 before being demolished. The Tropicana opened 66 years ago.\n\n\u2013 Atlanta center fielder Michael Harris says that Dodgers All-Star Mookie Betts has become a mentor for him, telling The Athletic: \u201cHe's been good to me. He's been a real good leader to me, just trying to keep my head on straight and teach me some different ways to go about life and stuff.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2013 Now that Theo Epstein has joined the Boston Red Sox\u2019s ownership group, maybe he can convince them to start spending some of their top draft picks on pitchers.\n\nThe Red Sox haven\u2019t drafted a pitcher with one of their first two picks since 2017, or selected a pitcher higher than 99th since Tanner Houck seven years ago.\n\n\u2013 Quote of the week, courtesy of Detroit Tigers rookie infielder Colt Keith after getting his six-year, $28.6425 million contract that includes three option years worth another $38 million: \u201cThere are positives and negatives and risks on both sides. Worst case for both of us, the organization and myself, is I don't pan out and I end up with security, financially, for me and my family for the rest of our lives.\n\n\u201cBest case for both of us is all of the option years are exercised, we win a couple of World Series, I make myself a boatload of money and I\u2019m still a free agent at 31.\"\n\n\u2013 The Texas Rangers may have sewn up the best mid-season acquisitions award with Max Scherzer, Jacob deGrom and Tyler Mahle each expected back before the All-Star break. Scherzer, 39, underwent surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back six weeks ago while deGrom is seven months removed from elbow surgery and Mahle 10 months from Tommy John surgery.\n\n\u2013 Since the retirement of Dustin Pedroia, the Red Sox are about to deploy their sixth different opening-day second baseman in the last six years: Eduardo Nunez (2019), Jose Peraza (2020), Enrique Hernandez (2021), Trevor Story (2022), Christian Arroyo (2023) and likely Vaughn Grissom (2024).\n\n\u2013 Minnesota Twins shortstop Carlos Correa says he\u2019s coming to camp feeling like a new man after dealing with plantar fasciitis in his left foot for most of the 2023 season. He struggled offensively, hitting just .230 with a .312 on-base percentage and .399 slugging percentage.\n\n\"You know me, I'm not going to blame my offensive struggles on that,\" Correa told reporters during the team's TwinsFest celebration. \u201cIt was more than that. But this year, I'm going to show up healthy, ready to go. My swing feels great. I want to have a big year. That's what I'm preparing for. \u2026You guys will see. It\u2019s really good.\u201d\n\n\u2013 The Perfect Game and commissioner Dennis Gilbert donated equipment to the Show Baseball travel program on Chicago\u2019s South Side after their coach, Ernest Radcliffe, was the victim of a car-jacking, losing all of their baseball equipment.\n\nPerfect Game delivered 28 boxes of baseballs, 10 baseball buckets with lids, and two fungo bats.\n\nPerfect Game also recently partnered with the Beyond Sports Lab, a minority-owned indoor baseball facility in Little Rock, Arkansas, to provide baseball development to underserved children. They will have a Black History Baseball and Softball camp on Sunday.\n\n\u201cOne of our stated goals at Perfect Game is to get as many children playing baseball and softball as possible,\" Gilbert said, \u201cand the volunteers with Beyond Sports Lab share that vision of not only, molding elite athletes but elite people, as well.\"\n\n\u2013 RIP Tom \u201cOtis\u2019\u2019 Hellman, the beloved Cubs 67-year-old clubhouse manager who passed away this past week from a fall.\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale"}

Your odds \u2013 as you'll see below \u2013 get a lot longer if you're Mr. Irrelevant, the last player picked in the draft.\n\nPurdy, selected 262nd in the 2022 draft, won't be the first Mr. Irrelevant to play in a Super Bowl, but he's likely to be the most consequential \u2013 err, yes, relevant \u2013 when the 49ers meet the Chiefs on Feb. 11.\n\nOther Mr. Irrelevants who have played in the Super Bowl\n\nIn the Super Bowl era, more than half of the players picked last never played a snap in the NFL. Less than a fifth, or 11, have played in 25 or more games as Purdy has, according to USA TODAY analysis of Pro Football Reference data.\n\nBefore 1992, the NFL draft included a dozen or more rounds. So it probably comes as little surprise that only Mr. Irrelevants of the past three decades made Super Bowl rosters. Including Purdy, there've only been three:\n\n\u25fe Marty Moore: The Patriots selected Moore, a linebacker from Kentucky, No. 222 in the 1994 draft. In his eight-year NFL career, Moore played most of his 112 games for the Patriots. He was the first Mr. Irrelevant to play in a Super Bowl (Super Bowl 31) for the Patriots. His other first: In his final season, he played on the winning Super Bowl 36 team, which was the first of six in the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick era.\n\n\u25fe Ryan Succop: Kansas City selected Succop, a kicker from South Carolina, No. 256 in the 2009 draft. In his 14-year career, Succop converted 83% of his 386 field-goal attempts in stints with the Chiefs, Titans and Buccaneers. In the 20-2021 season, Succop was the first Mr. Irrelevant to start a Super Bowl. In Super Bowl 55, the Buccaneers \u2013oddly another team quarterbacked by Brady \u2013 defeated the Chiefs, the team that drafted Succop.\n\n\u25fe Brock Purdy: When San Francisco selected Purdy in 2022, he became only the sixth quarterback taken with the last pick of an NFL draft. After the two other quarterbacks ahead of him suffered injuries, his star rose quickly in the 2022-23 season as Purdy won the first 10 regular-season games of his career.\n\nHow Purdy's and Mahomes' stats compared in 2023-24\n\nThe former Iowa State quarterback will duel with two-time league MVP Patrick Mahomes in the Super Bowl. They might have met there last season had Purdy not been injured in the NFC title game. This season, Purdy bettered Mahomes in several key statistics, but Mahomes has three Super Bowl starts (two wins) already in his six-year career.\n\nWhy is Brock Purdy and others called Mr. Irrelevant?\n\nPaul Salata launched \"Irrelevant Week\" with the 1976 draft. The former construction contractor had a short professional football career in the 1950s as a wide receiver in the NFL and Canadian Football League. The Mr. Irrelevant \"honor\" for the last player selected in the draft grew to include a family trip to Disneyland and a golf tournament. Mr. Irrelevant also received a trophy topped with a player fumbling a football.\n\nSalata died a day short of his 95 birthday in October 2021 \u2013 about 45 years after Kelvin Kirk of Dayton University became the first Mr. Irrelevant. That was also about eight months after Succop placekicked for the winning Buccaneers team.\n\nWho are all the Mr. Irrelevants \u2013 and other last picks \u2013 in the Super Bowl era\n\nSince 2013, every Mr Irrelevant has appeared in at least one NFL game. The five players who were selected last during the past six drafts, in bold, were on NFL rosters this season.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press, Pro Football Reference"}

Alan Anderson heads the energy practice with the law firm of Polsinelli and says when he hears arguments against wind and solar, he thinks of bears and Bigfoot.\n\n\u201cBears are real \u2013 if you have a bear in your campsite, that\u2019s not good,\u201d the Kansas City-based attorney said. \u201cBut if someone says there\u2019s a Bigfoot in their campsite, it\u2019s not real,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe're burdened by having to give factual information that's backed by science and engineering, whereas the other side's not. So we're at a disadvantage,\u201d he said.\n\nThat contrast was on display recently at a commissioners\u2019 meeting in Madison County, outside Columbus, Ohio. The proposed Oak Run solar farm would produce 800 megawatts of clean electricity, bringing an estimated $250 million in tax revenue over the project\u2019s 35-year life and providing dozens of long-term jobs.\n\nIt would also cover at least 4,000 acres with solar panels and require four to eight years to construct.\n\nA crowd of neighbors was there to make sure that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe panels would \u201ctake up prime farmland\u201d and kill birds, they said. \u201cThese are eyesores,\u201d said Heather Crum, of Somerford township. She and her husband moved to the area almost 20 years ago. \u201cHad we known, we would have done a 360.\u201d\n\nLocals are waiting for the Ohio Power Siting Board to decide whether the solar farm can be built. However they\u2019ve already taken steps to make sure no other such projects can ever come to their county. On Sept. 12, the county commission voted to prohibit all new wind and solar farms.\n\nAcross America, scenes like this one play out when large green energy projects are proposed. Some of the common objections are a matter of opinion \u2013 are wind turbines ugly or beautiful? Does a field of solar panels ruin a rural setting, or help preserve it?\n\nBut other arguments are based on false information. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the most common ones.\n\nThe issue: Do wind turbines kill birds and bats?\n\nThe short answer: Yes, wind turbines can kill both bats and birds. But the more important question is how many they kill compared with other sources.\n\nBuildings are estimated to kill up to 988 million birds a year. And domestic cats that are allowed outside are an enormous danger to birds, killing an estimated 4 million birds each year.\n\nA study to be published in 2024 found that wind farms had no statistically significant effect on bird counts. But another kind of energy did. Fracking reduced the total number of birds counted in near shale and oil production sites by 15%.\n\nAnd all of that is separate from considering the impact of climate change.\n\nThe National Audubon Society has estimated that as many as two-thirds of North American bird species \u2013 398 species \u2013 are at risk of extinction due to changes in habitat caused by global warming.\n\nThe issue: Are solar farms dangerous for birds?\n\nThe answer: Some water birds can mistake a large solar farm for a body of water and attempt to land on it, which can harm the birds. However, according to the National Audubon Society, some developers are adding special patterns to panels or using other strategies to minimize the risk of crash landings. Audubon also notes that many states require solar developers to grow native plants in and among solar farms, benefiting birds and other pollinators.\n\nThe issue: Power produced by wind and solar is just exported to people in other areas. Why should we have to produce it here?\n\nThe answer: Agricultural communities have always exported what they produce, whether it\u2019s crops or livestock. \u201cThe beef and potatoes that ranchers and dairymen produce in Idaho don\u2019t stay in Idaho,\u201d said John Robison, public lands director for the Idaho Conservation League.\n\nPeople in those communities see wheat and corn and soy being grown, see combines and grain bins, and know there\u2019s money for farmers and taxes for their communities. Solar advocates and energy developers say their task is to persuade people living near turbines or solar farms to look at them and realize it means jobs and better-funded schools and repaired roads.\n\nThe issue: Will worn-out solar panels overwhelm dumps with waste?\n\nThe answer: Improved standards for solar panels and wind turbines mean both have much longer lifespans today than they did a decade ago. Panels typically last 30 to 35 years while turbines have a lifespan of about 30 years.\n\nAt that point, it\u2019s true: they must be decommissioned and disposed of. But the trash this will eventually produce pales in comparison to that produced by households, coal ash and plastic waste.\n\nGlobally, municipal waste is expected to reach 70 billion metric tons by 2050, coal ash (the byproduct of burning coal) more than 45 billion metric tons and plastic waste 12 billion metric tons, a study published in the journal Nature Physics in October 2023 found.\n\nIn comparison, even in the worst case scenario, waste from solar panels is expected to reach 160 million metric tons globally by 2050.\n\nMost solar zoning codes require that the companies post bonds for decommissioning them at the end of their lifespan so that counties don\u2019t have to deal with disposal.\n\nThe issue: Do solar panels contain toxic materials such as arsenic, cadmium and gallium? Will that leach out of them in the rain?\n\nThe answer: There are a couple different issues here, including questions of what\u2019s really in the panels, and also whether any of that stuff is actually risky. Here\u2019s the breakdown.\n\nSolar panels are mostly made of glass, aluminum and silicon \u2013 77%, 10% and 3% respectively. It\u2019s true that trace elements are added to make them better conductors of electricity, usually cadmium and copper.\n\nWhat\u2019s less true is the idea of some other poisonous substances. Despite the fact that some states have gone so far as to ban use of these materials, there\u2019s no evidence that today\u2019s photovoltaic cells contain arsenic, germanium, hexavalent chromium or perfluoroalkyl substances. All of these items could, indeed, be poisonous, but they simply aren\u2019t there.\n\nThe other question is whether it\u2019s possible for any of those materials to exit the solar panel and poison something else.\n\nResearch published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials in 2017 found that it\u2019s possible to release the trace amounts of cadmium in a solar panel \u2013 but to do so, you\u2019d first have to crush the panel up, then put the resulting powder in an acidic environment over several weeks.\n\nThe bottom line: There\u2019s just not evidence of toxic material leaching out of solar panels in the rain.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped this argument from taking root. In Horry County, South Carolina, in 2020, in response to a proposed 138 megawatt solar project, community members raised concerns about the leaching of cadmium telluride, questioning what would happen if the solar panels were damaged in a hurricane. County council members also raised concerns about decommissioning and whether landfills would accept solar panels. Although the developer agreed not to use solar panels that include cadmium telluride, the project was never built.\n\nThe issue: Will wind turbines hurt nearby property values?\n\nThe answer: A study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory published in December found that on average homes located within one mile of a commercial wind turbine experience about an 11% decline in value following the announcement of a new commercial wind energy project. Homes between a mile and two miles were slightly affected, and any house more than two miles away wasn\u2019t affected at all.\n\nHowever, the effect was short-lived. Prices returned to pre-announcement levels within three to five years after the power project opened.\n\nThe study looked at nearly 500,000 home sales across 34 states near 428 different wind projects between 2005 and 2009. To be clear, during that time, wind turbines were not as tall as state-of-the-art turbines today. However, because modern turbines are taller and produce more energy per turbine, fewer of them are required, so the area of potential shadow and noise is smaller.\n\nResearch in the journal Energy Policy in 2022 showed that home values increased after wind projects began operating, though that is probably because taxes from the projects provided economic benefits to the area including better schools and infrastructure, making the community more enticing.\n\nThe issue: Do wind turbines create harmful, low-frequency noises?\n\nThe answer: Sound from wind turbines may be annoying but it has no established adverse health effects, according to Peter Thorne, a professor and head of the University of Iowa's Department of Occupational and Environmental Health.\n\nSome opponents have said that turbines emit a low-frequency \u201cinfra-sound\u201d that causes headaches, nausea and other problems. But a report published in 2019 found no link between health outcomes and proximity to turbines.\n\nWhile researchers said the symptoms were often real, they were linked to beliefs and negative expectations, not the turbines.\n\nThe issue: Will solar farms use up all our farmland?\n\nFarmland is a popular place to build solar because it\u2019s generally relatively flat and open. Not surprisingly, places where people grow crops tend to have good sunlight.\n\nSo an increasingly common argument for curtailing solar projects is to preserve farmland. Some counties now set limits on the amount of agricultural land that can be turned into a solar farm.\n\nOpponents argue that too much farmland being turned into solar will affect the country\u2019s ability to feed itself.\n\nOn this, the answer is clear: No, solar will not use up all the farmland we need.\n\nThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that for the U.S. to move completely to carbon-neutral power will require about 10,000 square miles of land.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture already pays farmers to take about 24.8 million acres of less productive and environmentally sensitive land out of production. That\u2019s 38,750 square miles \u2013 more than the entire amount of land that would be needed for green energy.\n\nAnd in 2023, about 40% of the U.S. corn crop was used to produce ethanol. By some measures, an acre of solar power can make 70 times as much energy as an acre\u2019s worth of corn turned into ethanol. (You read that right: 70 times as much power.)\n\nThe issue: Can\u2019t we put solar on top of old warehouses so we don\u2019t need big fields of solar panels?\n\nOne version of this argument asserts that by placing solar panels on old industrial properties that have limited uses, such as old surface coal mines, chemical plants or former military sites, no undisturbed land will need to be used for solar power.\n\nThis is called turning \u201cbrownfields\u201d into \u201cbrightfields,\u201d and avoiding solar on \u201cgreenfields.\u201d\n\nThere are two problems. One is that there can be a high added expense to building on potentially toxic ground.\n\nSuch projects can and often are placed on old landfill properties, but these are still more expensive than farmland or scrubland.\n\nThe answer: Either way, solar panels ultimately have to cover acreage because they all need to face the sky. There simply aren\u2019t enough brownfields to reach the full needs of the energy transition.\n\nThe issue: Do wind and solar farms destroy rural aesthetics?\n\nThere\u2019s no rebuttal to this one: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Some people behold a wind turbine or a solar installation and see clean energy that will help stop global warming and make the United States more energy independent. Others see them as a blight that destroys the landscape and turns it into an industrial eyesore.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re ugly, they don\u2019t work and they can explode,\u201d was how Elizabeth Finke described at a hearing on a proposed solar installation near her family farm in Madison County, Ohio.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that solar farms, compared with wind turbines, sit relatively low to the ground. In some parts of the country, once those panels are screened off by a row of trees or vegetation, they\u2019re hardly visible from afar.

It wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d ever thought she\u2019d have to do in her 93 years in the place her grandfather first homesteaded in the 1860s.\n\nCalmly setting aside her walker, she looked at the county commissioners arrayed to her left and began to speak.\n\n\u201cI never in all my life thought I would stand up here to protect our property rights by being able to use our land legally for the best benefit of our family,\u201d she said.\n\nTo her right, scores of people were in line behind her. Many of them had other ideas.\n\nSome implored the commissioners to vote to allow the so-called West Gardner plan, a utility-size array of solar panels, saying the county needed to commit to clean energy for their children\u2019s future.\n\nBut others were just as passionately opposed. Many wore matching T-shirts that implored the council to \u201cStop INDUSTRIAL SOLAR,\u201d testifying for more than three hours against the plan for Knoche\u2019s farm and others across the county.\n\nTo them, the solar plant would \u201cthreaten health and well-being\u201d and did not fit \u201cthe character of the land.\u201d It would create \u201ca landscape of black glass and towering windmills,\u201d that would put lives at risk and cause \u201ca mass exodus out of the area.\u201d\n\nThe fight played out in front of one small county commission in one 613,000-person county. But at its heart, this fight \u2013 and hundreds of others like it across the country \u2013 was over the future of the whole nation\u2019s energy supply and, perhaps, the future of the planet.\n\nAs the country races to shift to carbon-free energy to forestall climate change, opposition movements have popped up nationwide to fight new solar and wind farms, hampering America\u2019s chances of meeting its climate pledges.\n\nA USA TODAY analysis of local rules and policies nationwide found that, as of December, 15% of counties in the United States had banned or otherwise blocked new utility-scale wind farms, solar installations or both.\n\nIn the past decade, 183 U.S. counties had their first wind projects start producing power, while nearly 375 blocked new wind turbines. In 2023, almost as many counties blocked new solar projects as added them.\n\nThe reasons for local opposition are varied and the motives behind them can be murky but often boil down to one essential idea: Renewables are fine, but we don\u2019t want them here.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem, said Grace Wu, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies energy systems and land use change. \u201cIf nowhere seems to be the right place, increasingly we\u2019ll have a harder and harder time to site them.\u201d\n\nThe land owned by the Knoche family is just one spot in a statewide fight in Kansas, which has both the nation\u2019s fourth best wind resources and, as solar power technology has become more efficient, strong solar as well: the same sunlight that drives photosynthesis in large-scale crops like corn can generate energy in solar panels.\n\nToday, the state gets 47.13% of its electricity from wind and 0.33% from solar.\n\nYet now, 14 of the 105 counties in Kansas block wind turbines and 12 block solar farms. These include outright bans, height restrictions, unworkable setbacks for turbines, size limitations for solar farms, caps on the amount of agricultural land that can be used and, in McPherson County, an \u201cindefinite moratorium\u201d on solar applications.\n\nThese efforts mirror those in hundreds of counties and townships across the nation, where the merest hint of a potential project quickly brings forth a Facebook group, yard signs, organized protests and \u2013 increasingly \u2013 zoning rules and laws that make new renewable energy impossible to build.\n\nSeen as just one flare-up in a nationwide trend to oppose local green-energy projects, the fight in Johnson County shouldn\u2019t be surprising.\n\nBut to Donna Knoche, 93, and her husband Robert \u201cDoc\u201d Knoche, 95, it\u2019s bewildering \u2013 and annoying.\n\nFor them, leasing acres to a solar farm would simplify their land\u2019s care, keep it available for farming when the lease runs out and allow it to continue to be passed on through the generations.\n\n\u201cWe figured it was just one of those sorts of things that you could do \u2013 like buying a house or leasing a car. You could just do it on your own and not have to deal with all this complexity,\u201d Donna said.\n\nInstead, it has become a five-year battle.\n\n\u201cI had no idea it would drag on this long,\u201d said Doc.\n\nDeep roots in Kansas\n\nBoth Donna and Doc have deep roots in this land.\n\nDonna\u2019s grandfather William Brecheisen came to the United States in 1850 as a 7-year-old. His German-speaking family was from Alsace\u2013Lorraine, at that time part of the German Empire.\n\n\u201cThey got the Kansas Fever,\u201d she said. \u201cThey came out in a prairie schooner wagon,\u201d she said.\n\nWilliam served in the Union Army during the Civil War and then came home to Kansas, where he homesteaded 160 acres of the flat, productive plains.\n\n\u201cWe have the patent from 1868,\u201d Donna said proudly from her well-worn chair next to her husband\u2019s matching one in the living room of their simple rambler in Gardner, Kansas. They\u2019ve lived here since 1959. It\u2019s where they raised their six children.\n\nRobert is universally known as Doc after working more than 60 years as a large animal veterinarian in the area \u2013 he still has his license. He grew up in the town of Paola. After the death of his mother he was raised on his uncle and aunt\u2019s farm. At the time, they worked the land not with machines but with half a dozen horses \u2013 \u201cand two mules,\u201d he said.\n\nToo young to serve in World War II, he had to wait several years to start veterinary school because all the slots were reserved for veterans.\n\nHe graduated in 1954 and settled in Gardner, a town of 650 at the time.\n\nHe roomed with a local woman who took in boarders, and went on dates with a few girls in town. \u201cI never asked for a second date,\u201d he says. Then his landlady\u2019s daughter had a baby at the new hospital in Gardner and Robert met a nurse who had just been hired there \u2013 Donna.\n\nTheir first date was on July 12, 1952, \u201cto a picture show in Ottawa\u201d about 25 miles away. They drove in Doc\u2019s 1951 Ford.\n\nToday when they tell this story, the couple look at each other \u2013 their matching chairs side by side \u2013 and smile.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been married for 70 years,\u201d Donna said.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how it all worked out,\u201d Doc said.\n\nThose 160 acres that Donna\u2019s grandfather had farmed grew as the family bought up additional land.\n\nToday that legacy is about 1,190 acres of farmland that straddles Johnson and Douglas counties. For many years, the Knoches rented out most of the ground to Donna\u2019s uncle Lucky Brecheisen, who grew corn, soybeans and hay. After he died in 1997 they took over, eventually running a 200-head cow-calf operation in addition to the veterinary practice.\n\n\u201cWe bought some land south of Gardner and we had mostly Angus cattle of our own,\u201d Doc said. \u201cI built the fences and mowed the hay. Mom would answer the phone when people called for emergencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy, it was long hours,\u201d Doc says of the 10-year stint. Shoulder surgery around 2010 forced him to give up his herd. Since then, they\u2019ve rented the land to other farmers and ranchers.\n\nDoc doesn\u2019t call himself a farmer, but he knows the soil is not as fertile as it is elsewhere. \u201cLucky always said, \u2018We\u2019ve got all bottom land \u2013 because the top land is all washed away.\u2019 So it's not the good prime ground you think of,\u201d Doc said.\n\nKeeping the land healthy and productive is important to the family. \u201cWe've worked to conserve the soil and make it better through the years,\u201d said Donna.\n\nIn time, they realized they would never farm the whole property, and no one person in their family was likely to, either. That led to a conundrum.\n\nThe Knoches have six children, 11 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. As they approached their 90s, they\u2019d wrestled with how to divide the 1,190 acres among all those heirs.\n\nThey had a plan for sharing, but then a better one came up. In 2018, they came home to a message on their answering machine.\n\nThe caller was from a solar developer looking to lease land in the area for a solar farm.\n\n\u201cWell, I called him back and we talked about it,\u201d Doc said, \u201cand it sounded better than farming.\u201d It didn\u2019t hurt that one of their sons-in-law, Steve Clark, was an engineer and solar consultant, so they had an expert to talk with.\n\nThe Knoches ended up signing a four-year lease on their land with NextEra Energy, as did other landowners and farmers nearby.\n\nThe deal gave the company an option to build on the land. The Knoches got a little bit of money for the agreement, and for a while, nothing else happened. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make a big show of it,\u201d Donna said.\n\nThey figured it would take a long time for an energy plant to be developed, if ever.\n\nThey\u2019d heard stories about windmills in other places, and how people fought them. This seemed different. A solar farm would keep the rural land from being built up as something else \u2013 a subdivision, or a warehouse. The panels lasted a long time, up to 30 years, but after that, they could be removed and the land could be farmed again, if people wanted.\n\nThey didn\u2019t think about it much for the next few years.\n\n\u201cI really hadn't heard much about people fighting solar,\u201d Doc said. Then he looked over at his wife, something between a smile and a grimace on his face.\n\n\u201cSo we found out about it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe opposition to solar\n\nThe planned solar farm \u2013 the West Gardner Solar Project \u2013 was originally proposed to include as much as 3,000 acres spread over Douglas and Johnson counties that would generate up to 320 megawatts of electricity. The project would also include 129 megawatts of battery storage, to make the solar energy available when the sun isn\u2019t shining.\n\nThen things got contentious.\n\nPeople heard about the leases and began to organize against the proposed solar farm. A Facebook group opposing the project appeared, several groups were formed and a website was created.\n\nSoon there were hearings scheduled before the Johnson County commissioners, who were considering various proposals amending the zoning regulations for solar facilities and battery storage.\n\nThere were work sessions. Planning commission meetings. Subcommittee meetings. The work stretched for more than a year.\n\nCrowds of opponents flocked to public meetings to demand the plans for a solar farm be shut down.\n\nThe family estimates between the two counties they\u2019ve attended more than a dozen meetings, not including the ones they\u2019ve watched online.\n\nFinally, June 2022 arrived. The goal on this warm summer night was to vote on exactly what the county would allow. How large could the solar installations be? How far must they be from towns? What about stormwater runoff? How much of a buffer should there be from the land of other neighbors who weren\u2019t part of the project? How many years would permits be valid?\n\nEven if county commissioners allowed solar projects, there would still be other hurdles.\n\nOpponents decried what they call industrial wind and solar and said the installations have no place in an idyllic landscape of corn, wheat, soybeans and cattle.\n\nThey said solar panels would drip toxic chemicals from their glass into the ground, contaminating wells. The land under them would heat up and kill all surrounding vegetation. The solar cells and batteries planned to accompany them would be at risk for catastrophic fires that country firefighters would be unable to contain. Property values would fall and so much of the land would be consumed that the country would risk starving.\n\nThose Johnson County meetings aired many of the same concerns that emerged nationwide, in more than a dozen different local zoning meetings reviewed online or in person by USA TODAY.\n\nThe problem with these concerns is that almost none of them are true.\n\n\u201cThey had these meetings and they were very negative,\u201d said Karlene Thomson, one of the Knoches\u2019 daughters. \u201cA lot of misinformation got put out.\u201d\n\nThe meeting on June 6, 2022, lasted more than three hours.\n\nIt began with a solemn recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Then speaker after speaker came forward. There were many in favor of the project, but most were adamantly \u2013 though politely \u2013 opposed.\n\nTo them the solar farm was an intrusion of industrial energy production that would destroy the rural community that they loved.\n\nNot that the area hadn\u2019t long been home to more than farms. The 9,000 acre Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant was built there in 1942, employing more than 15,000 people at the height of World War II. In 2013, BNSF Railway opened an intermodal shipping hub in the southern part of the county. The 330-acre I-35 Logistics Park opened the same year. Panasonic broke ground on a new battery plant on the old ammunition plant in 2022.\n\nAnd people from nearby Olathe, Overland Park and even Kansas City kept moving deeper into the county, buying small 5- and 10-acre plots to build their dream homes on.\n\nBut thousands of acres of solar panels was something no one had ever experienced, and they didn\u2019t like it.\n\n\u201cThis is so far off from being right, I don't even have words. You will be affecting over 200 homeowners and 1,200 souls with one project,\u201d said Lisa Huppe of nearby Edgerton, Kansas.\n\n\u201cWe are not against solar energy. However, when it comes to utility scale facilities in the agricultural communities of rural Johnson County, it\u2019s the wrong choice,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you allow this to happen, commissioners, you will devalue the property and destroy the lives that we have spent years building here and threaten our health and well-being.\u201d\n\nMany opponents sported T-shirts that read \u201cCounty Commissioners: Protect our Quality of Life. Let us help you draft regulations that stop INDUSTRIAL SOLAR.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stand to lose the character of our communities, with a transition from agricultural to industrial use,\u201d said Pam Ferguson of Eudora. \u201cDevelopers want you to think that we need to turn our state into a landscape of black glass and towering windmills. And if you do so, the planet will be ruined.\u201d\n\nSolar and wind power need to be sited responsibly, away from places like Johnson County which have lots of people in them, said Carrie Brandon, chairperson for Douglas County/Johnson County Kansans for Responsible Solar.\n\n\u201cWe realize that renewable energy is needed to offset oil and coal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have brilliant people on our planet who are constantly coming up with new energy inventions. Haste makes for waste \u2013 we can be smart about it and not just go all in on blanketing rural areas and taking agricultural land out of our inventory.\u201d\n\nBrandon says her work to fight the project has taken a toll on her health and her business. \u201cI\u2019ve spent at least half a million dollars at my hourly rate, it\u2019s been an enormous effort over the last three years,\u201d she said.\n\nFor the Knoches, the desire to farm the sun on their land is a simple matter of property rights. They and other landowners want to maximize the profit they make from their fields without having to sell it off or break it up. It\u2019s their land. They should use it as they see fit.\n\n\u201cThis opposition doesn\u2019t seem to be concerned about property rights for anybody but themselves,\u201d said Donna.\n\nOf course, zoning restrictions are nothing new. The Knoches think the solar panels \u2013 not very tall, silent, no smoke or other emissions \u2013 make for a better fit in farm country than almost anything else that might get built.\n\nBut the family also can\u2019t help but see it as a matter of seniority. After all, this has been their land for the better part of two centuries.\n\nDoc does allow that things started to change even in the 1950s. People moved out of the city to small farms for the ambiance.\n\nBack in those days they were called agriculturalists.\n\n\u201cThere was a story about the difference between a farmer and an agriculturalist,\u201d he said. \u201cA farmer makes money on the farm and spends it in town. An agriculturalist makes money in town and comes out and buys a farm and spends it on his farm,\u201d Doc said.\n\nBack then, the spreads people bought were maybe 160 acres, he said. People actually farmed. Today the lot sizes of those seeking a rural lifestyle are a lot smaller, often as little as five acres, said their daughter Jane Knoche.\n\n\u201cTheir big statement is they came out to the rural peace and quiet of the rural area,\u201d she said.\n\nThe issue has been divisive enough that it\u2019s made the county a less neighborly place. On a drive to visit the land where the solar farm would be built, Jane pointed out sign after sign on fenceposts and in storefronts reading \u201cNo Industrial Solar\u201d and \u201cProtect our Quality of Life.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so fun to see,\u201d Jane said.\n\nDoc, who loves airplanes and aviation, likes to hang out at the tiny Gardner Municipal Airport with his buddies. Until the day someone tracked him down there to confront him about the plan.\n\n\u201cHe came in there and said \u2018I guess you\u2019re real proud of the fact that you\u2019ve lowered everybody\u2019s property values,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nFacing the future of green energy\n\nRenewable energy plants do get built in Kansas.\n\nTwo hours northwest of the Knoches\u2019 home is the Amerugi Farm. It\u2019s 400 acres of corn, soybeans, barley, oats, rye and alfalfa, woodlands and pasture. It\u2019s also home to one wind turbine that\u2019s part of the Soldier Creek Wind Energy Center.\n\nThe wind project, which includes 120 turbines dotted across the fields of 200 participating landowners, went into operation in 2020 and today produces up to 300 megawatts of electricity, about enough for about 64,000 homes.\n\nMary Fund and her husband Ed Reznicek have farmed there since 1978 on land Fund\u2019s family has owned since the 1870s. The one wind turbine on their land gives them a small lease payment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice little addition to our retirement income but it\u2019s not going to make us rich,\u201d said Fund, 70.\n\nShe views that turbine in much the same way her mother and aunt saw the oil leases on the farm in the early 1980s.\n\n\u201cThey struck oil, so we have a couple of oil wells on our land. They helped my mother in her old age,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, across the farm country where green energy is now controversial, pump jacks and gas wells have long extracted from the ground below to create a far less green kind of energy. Nemaha County is home to 22 oil wells and in 2022 produced 33,788 barrels of oil, enough to make as much as 675,000 gallons of gasoline.\n\nThe state as a whole has more than 48,000 oil wells and 19,000 natural gas wells in production in 2023.\n\nIt\u2019s a kind of karma, Fund said. \u201cYou don\u2019t let them extract oil from your land and then not let them put up a turbine.\u201d\n\nThey signed a lease in July 2018 that gave a three-year option for NextEra to explore use of their land as a site for a potential turbine, but only after several months of communications with the wind farm representative, visiting other windfarms to see what it felt like to be near turbines and a lot of research.\n\n\u201cI really have to confess I didn\u2019t think anybody would oppose it,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, why would you?\"\n\nShe was wrong. Things quickly got testy, much of it organized through Facebook. Speakers railed against wind and stacks of a misinformation-filled book appeared on the counters of local businesses and local libraries all winter long.\n\n\u201cIt was never clear who brought these into the county, but the website of South Dakotans for Safe & Responsible Renewable Energy offers a case of 30 for $1,000 donations,\u201d she said.\n\nThe furor over the plan made the couple enemies in the place they\u2019d lived together for 45 years, the place where Fund grew up.\n\n\u201cThere are people who don\u2019t talk to each other anymore, and people who grudgingly moved on and talk about everything but the wind farm,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a neighbor who won\u2019t talk to me, but her husband will.\u201d\n\nIn the end, county commissioners voted to approve the wind farm in 2019. It was built in 2020 and now brings about $900,000 in taxes to the county each year.\n\nThat\u2019s on top of the lease payments made directly to landowners including Mary and Ed.\n\nThe Soldier Creek turbines dot a spare, wind-swept landscape of farms, grazing land, creeks and woodlots.\n\nLiving near the turbines hasn\u2019t bothered the couple. On quiet nights they can hear both the turbine and the oil wells.\n\nBut theirs seems likely to be the last wind power that will be built in Nemaha County. After the first conditional use permits were approved in early 2019, the county commission passed a moratorium on new projects in May of 2019.\n\nIn October of 2023 they passed a resolution extending the moratorium for another year. A new County Comprehensive Plan documents opposition to further wind energy and effectively warns off developers.\n\nWhen the Knoches first began considering the possibility of a solar project on their land, they were both in their 80s. Doc was still enjoying his hobby of going up in a gas-powered hang glider. Three of their children were still in their 50s and they only had 11 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.\n\nIn December 2023, everyone was older. Doc had stopped flying and suffered a fall. Donna had to be more careful when she walked.\n\nAnd they weren\u2019t much closer to having a deal.\n\nBoth Douglas and Johnson counties have passed new zoning regulations surrounding solar. In Douglas as of 2022, projects are limited to no more than 1,000 acres and must be at least 500 feet from existing residences. In Johnson, there\u2019s a cap of 2,000 acres per project and a one-and-a-half mile setback from neighboring cities.\n\nAnother solar project, which had nothing to do with their land, is now also going through the process in Douglas County. It ended the year with a packed planning meeting that went past 2:00 am on Dec. 19, which is now headed to yet another vote by the county commission.\n\nThe Knoches continue to live in their modest rambler, full of photos, mementos. They visit children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. They offer donuts to guests and pull out scrapbooks with clippings about the project along with books on the family\u2019s history in the area.\n\nBoth wonder at the changes they\u2019ve seen in their lives. Donna tells of growing up with kerosene lamps and remembers when they first got an Aladdin lamp, which burned kerosene but used a mantle instead of a wick.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like night and day compared to that old kerosene lamp,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get electricity out in the farm until, it was 1947 or 1948, when I was in high school.\u201d\n\nDoc ponders the shifts in a state where he first plowed with horses and mules. As he testified to the county commission, he\u2019s not afraid solar power will turn the county\u2019s farmland into an industrial wasteland.\n\nHe\u2019s afraid of the constant push to turn farms into subdivisions.\n\n\u201cOut here,\u201d he said, \u201cI think in five, ten years you'll be glad it's there because you're going to be crowded out by other people.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced with support from the McGraw Center for Business Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York."}

It also required setting a standard as to which restrictions are restrictive enough to count.\n\nHere\u2019s what we found, and how we measured it:\n\nBans\n\nIn some cases, counties simply ban large renewable energy projects, as part of a backlash to their growing presence. Any county with a ban was counted in our data.\n\nAn example is in Pulaski County, Indiana. A wind farm was under consideration for Jasper and Pulaski counties in 2018. The developers said the 20 to 30 turbines in the county would have produced $600,000 per year in tax revenue.\n\nBut opposed residents said the project would harm the local economy, reduce property values, affect human health, compromise military readiness, hurt wildlife and lead to the loss of \u201cquiet nights, dark skies and the scenic nature of the region.\u201d\n\nIn 2021 the Pulaski County board of commissioners banned all commercial wind turbines from the county, citing the need to protect and promote the \u201chealth, safety and general welfare of the residents.\u201d\n\nThese kinds of bans proliferated. By the end of 2023, 292 counties nationwide had similar ones in place.\n\nMoratoriums\n\nCounties use moratoriums to buy time to write new zoning and regulation for wind and solar farms, sometimes to craft reasonable laws and sometimes to craft bans. As of the end of 2023, 26 counties had moratoriums in place on new solar projects and 17 on wind projects.\n\nIn most cases, a county realizes it doesn\u2019t have adequate zoning and regulation in place to properly evaluate a solar or wind project, so officials place a moratorium on any new renewable projects while its county zoning board writes one. Once the new rule is adopted, the moratorium is lifted.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in Linn County, Iowa. Two solar projects were approved in 2022 amid a fair amount of dissent.\n\n\u201cSo the supervisors pressed the pause button,\u201d said Steve Guyer with the Iowa Environmental Council.\n\nDuring a year\u2019s moratorium, the county wrote revised rules that were considered fairly reasonable by everyone. As county supervisor Louis Zumback told a local television station, \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing in it that is a poison pill.\u201d\n\nIn Colorado, which has some of the best wind resources in the nation, five counties put moratoriums in place in 2022 and 2023 while they updated their land use codes.\n\nBut in other cases, a moratorium is closer to a stand-in for a ban.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll carefully craft the ordinance so it doesn\u2019t look ridiculously restrictive, but they know it will stop it,\u201d said Ed Rivet, executive director of the Michigan Conservative Energy Forum, which supports the rights of landowners and all energy, whether renewable or fossil fuels.\n\nSome counties have enacted what they call \u201cindefinite moratoriums.\u201d\n\nIn 2018 Thomas County, Georgia passed a rule saying energy facilities would not be allowed \"indefinitely.\" Hardin County, Iowa put an indefinite moratorium in place in 2019 and in 2023 in McPherson County, Kansas, the county commission \u201cindefinitely extended\u201d its moratorium on wind turbines.\n\nImpediments: Heights and setbacks\n\nIf you\u2019re allowed to build a wind turbine, but it has to be so short that it can\u2019t catch the wind, you can\u2019t run a successful power plan. If your county allows turbines \u2013 but requires they be at least a mile from anyone else\u2019s property line, \u2013 chances are there are almost no places turbines can really be built.\n\nThat\u2019s the scenario in counties across the country. Green energy might technically be allowed, but building restrictions, especially focused on wind power, make it so difficult that experts and industry representatives agree there\u2019s no practical way to build.\n\nHeight is crucial to wind power because winds are generally stronger at a higher altitude. And a taller turbine can hold longer blades, which catch more air.\n\nSo a taller wind turbine captures more wind at faster speeds, making it more powerful and efficient. In the United States today, most new turbines start at around 525 feet and go as high as 650 feet tall. (The U.S. doesn\u2019t even have the most powerful new models. In 2023 a Danish turbine was built at almost 920 feet tall, producing 80 gigawatts of energy, enough to power about 20,000 homes.)\n\nUSA TODAY\u2019s analysis of rules considers a height limit of 500 feet below to be a significant impediment, based on the consensus of experts including energy attorneys and university academics who study renewable energy. They agree that overall, if turbines are limited to 500 feet, they are far less likely to be economically viable.\n\nIn 2014, Connecticut passed a law that required setbacks of at least 2.5 times a turbine\u2019s height, typically about 1,250 feet. No new wind projects have been built there since then.\n\nAnd at some point, a height limit is so low that it\u2019s not just an impediment, it\u2019s really a ban. The limits range from no more than 80 feet in Inyo County, California to a trio of counties in Colorado, Iowa and Virginia that max out at 500.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of \u201csetbacks.\u201d That means how far any one turbine must be \u201cset back\u201d from the edge of the next property that isn't part of the wind farm.\n\nModel zoning ordinances in multiple states require a setback of 1.1 to 1.5 times the height of a turbine \u2013 so, about 550 to 750 feet. That way even if a turbine should fall over (an exceedingly rare occurrence) it would not touch neighbors\u2019 property.\n\nBut some locales require more extreme setbacks. USA TODAY\u2019s analysis considers a setback requirement greater than 1,000 feet to be a significant impediment to wind power.\n\nThe most extreme in the nation are in Nebraska.\n\nThe Cornhusker state, which ranks third or fourth in the nation for its potential wind power, has three counties with one-mile setback requirements (5,280 feet), two with two-mile setbacks, three with three-mile setbacks and one \u2013 Wheeler County \u2013 which in 2021 passed a five-mile setback requirement, the greatest distance in the country.\n\nEven politically progressive areas have blocked green energy with these rules. In 2017, Vermont passed a setback requirement of 10 times turbine height, or about one mile, from the nearest residence. (It also enacted a sound limit of no more than 35 decibels at night.) No wind projects have been permitted in the state since then.\n\nImpediments: Noise limits\n\nIn the 2010s a common concern about wind turbines was that the swishing noise was annoying or even dangerous to residents\u2019 health. The health effects have been discounted and today turbines are quiet enough with reasonable setbacks that sound is not considered a major issue.\n\nWhen Indiana enacted voluntary model renewable energy zoning regulations, it set a maximum allowable sound limit of 50 decibels, about the sound of a household refrigerator.\n\nBut other places set tough noise limits. Vermont\u2019s 35-decibel limit is somewhere between the sound of a library and a quiet rural area, according to Purdue University.\n\nUSA TODAY\u2019s analysis considers sound limits below 50 decibels to be impediments to wind power.\n\nAt some point even lower than that, sound limits also can become de facto bans.\n\n\u201cThe decision makers may say a 30 decibel sound limit sounds like a great thing, but that\u2019s quieter than the wind itself, so you\u2019re effectively placing a ban on this form of energy without having to set a ban,\u201d said Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association, based in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nA total of 36 counties have decibel limits lower than 50, almost all enacted between 2012 and 2017.\n\nA block to wind: Ridgeline rules\n\nOther rules can make green energy farms impractical. One impediment for wind turbines is when they are banned on ridge tops.\n\nWind is stronger at the top of a ridgeline than at the bottom. In mountainous areas, if turbines can\u2019t be built on top of the ridges, they can\u2019t catch the wind.\n\nIn 2018, Tennessee passed a law making utility-scale wind almost impossible to build by setting a minimum setback of 3\u00bd times a turbine\u2019s height (at least 1,500 feet), a noise limit of 35 decibels and a 500-foot height limit.\n\nCrucially, though, the law also allows no turbines over 350 feet high on mountain ridges. So in the state\u2019s mountainous end, even if turbines could be placed in a rural spot with 1,500-foot setbacks, they couldn\u2019t actually be built high enough to catch the wind.\n\nThis became the law in every county that did not already have a wind ordinance in place. Four counties \u2013 Gibson, Jefferson, Shelby and Washington \u2013 did have preexisting ordinances and are open to wind development.\n\nAs a result, Tennessee has only one wind farm, built in 2004.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s limits date back to 1983, when a development company built a ten-story condominium building on Little Sugar Mountain next to a ski resort. Deeply loathed by local residents, it spurred them to pass the Mountain Ridge Protection Act. which allowed counties to ban structures over 40 feet high on ridge lines. That meant wind turbines, as well as condo towers, became off-limits.\n\nA later amendment set the maximum wind turbine height in those counties at 100 feet. In the end, 24 counties adopted the law, putting all wind off-limits in one-quarter of the state. The state built one wind project since then, in 2017, though one other is now in the works.\n\nA block to solar: Agriculture rules\n\nAn increasingly common way to curtail solar projects is to set limits on the amount of agricultural land that can be used for them in a county. Farmland is a popular place to build solar because it\u2019s generally relatively flat and open. Not surprisingly, places where crops are grown tend to have good sunlight.\n\nUSA TODAY\u2019s analysis found that in at least 22 counties in nine states, agricultural limits have been used to create impediments to solar power.\n\nOpponents argue that too much farmland being turned into solar will affect the country\u2019s ability to feed itself at the national level and destroy the rural nature of life at the county level.\n\nYet the U.S. currently pays farmers nationwide to keep millions of acres out of production.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped the argument that solar should be blocked from farmland. It\u2019s commonly used in Midwestern counties but has been most prevalent in Virginia, where 14 of the state\u2019s 95 counties have some type of restriction on the amount or percentage of land that can be used for solar power. In October 2023, a representative from Dominion Energy, one of the state\u2019s two largest electric utilities, said building out the 16,000 megawatts of solar production required by 2020\u2019s Virginia Clean Economy Act will require about 160,000 acres of state land and would take up less than 1.5% of Virginia\u2019s prime farm and forest land.\n\nPolitical blocks\n\nIn some counties, local governments simply refuse to engage with would-be solar or wind developers or make it impossible to build.\n\nIn Labette County, Kansas, the County Commission has refused to sign road agreements with any industrial wind developer.\n\nIn Nebraska, Dawson County passed a permitting fee of $1,000 per solar panel in 2022. By way of comparison, a recent 81 megawatt solar project for Omaha would require about 160,000 panels. In Dawson County, such a project would cost $160 million in fees alone.\n\nSometimes counties may simply ignore state law.\n\nIn Maryland, the state Supreme Court ruled the Public Service Commission has final say on locating solar projects. Even so, a third of its counties have impediments in place.\n\n\u201cCounties are trying to make legal arguments for why they don\u2019t have to abide by the state\u2019s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. It tacks on legal fees and some developers are getting tired of paying,\u201d said Stephanie Johnson, executive director of the Chesapeake Solar and Storage Association.\n\nBut some states are wide open\n\nIn spite of some locales' right-wing politics turning against green energy, other areas, including conservative ones, remain pro-renewable.\n\nThe opportunity to make money from the land \u2013 and a strong belief in private property rights \u2013 sometimes are the reasons.\n\nTexas is the nation\u2019s leader in wind-powered electricity and has been since 2005. Wind produces 23% of its electricity and solar more than 5%. There are no county-level blocks to renewables, partly because Texas has very strong rules governing the rights of private property owners and partly because of its long history of energy extraction.\n\nFlorida has the nation\u2019s third largest solar generating capacity and is rapidly scaling up with output. In 2021 it passed a law prohibiting local governments from restricting solar energy on farmland. Liberal Massachusetts passed a similar law in 2022.\n\nWyoming has strong winds and already gets 22% of its electricity from them. It passed a law putting wind projects with 20 or more turbines under the jurisdiction of its state environmental agency\u2019s Industrial Siting Council \u2013 meaning local jurisdictions can\u2019t limit them.\n\nThere are also states that have begun pushing back against local restrictions, by taking that authority away from counties. Illinois and Michigan both made this move in 2023.\n\nNew York State has passed laws attempting to simplify and speed up renewable siting efforts. The latest, in 2021, established the Office of Renewable Energy Siting, which can override burdensome local laws.\n\nOther states try to make it easier for developers by effectively telling them \u201cHere, but not there.\u201d\n\nMaine was one of the first, creating a Wind Expedited Permitting Area that mapped the portions of the state considered best suited and most appropriate for wind projects. Today Maine's wind farms produce more than a quarter of the state\u2019s electricity.\n\nWashington state created a pilot program to head off clashes. A June report mapped out 212,000 acres deemed potentially low conflict and highly suitable for solar projects.\n\nHow we did this report\n\nUSA TODAY\u2019s analysis began in 2022 with data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Columbia University\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. Both track laws governing solar and wind energy at the county and municipality level.\n\nWe built on that with more than a year\u2019s worth of research tracking restrictions on wind and solar using federal data, local government filings and media reports from across the country.\n\nWe used this to create a database of rules and zoning restrictions for counties, plus some municipalities. We also indexed those by the date they began, stretching from the first we found, in 2000, through the end of 2023.\n\nAfter interviews with more than 45 experts, we set standards for what kinds of rules and conditions constituted blocks to new, utility-scale (over 5 megawatts) wind and solar projects. These fell into four categories: outright bans, moratoriums, significance impediments and other conditions that made projects difficult to permit.\n\nFor each state, we created an overview of current and past state law on the placement and regulation of wind and solar power, and a list of counties that currently have blocks. We ran each state\u2019s overview by at least two experts familiar with the state to confirm our findings. These included regional and state academics, regulators, renewable energy developers and groups supporting wind and or solar power.\n\nThe overall methodology and conclusions were vetted by a panel that included state and national experts from the industry and academia. They were:\n\nAlan Anderson, chair of the energy practice at Polsinelli law firm, Kansas City.\n\nMatt Eisenson, a senior fellow at the Renewable Energy Legal Defense Initiative at Columbia University\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. He wrote their 2023 paper Opposition to Renewable Energy Facilities in the United States.\n\nTamara Ogle, a member of the land use team at Purdue University Extension, who inventoried Indiana\u2019s renewable energy ordinances in 2022.\n\nAfter a year and a half of data collection, by the end of 2023, we had identified 471 counties in the United States in which it is now difficult or impossible to build a new, utility-scale wind or solar farm. This inventory, and the date each block began, allowed us to see the increases over time.\n\nOur conclusions are corroborated by research from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which previously found existing local ordinances are responsible for about a 13% reduction in wind capacity and a 2% reduction in solar capacity across the nation. The NREL numbers, based on ordinances in place in 2021, likely underestimate the effect on solar because of the large number of new solar impediments USA TODAY found from 2022 and 2023.\n\nThis story was produced with support from the McGraw Center for Business Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York."}

These limits come through outright bans, moratoriums, construction impediments and other conditions that make green energy difficult to build.\n\nThe impediments come as a gigantic effort to build green energy also is under way. U.S. energy from commercial wind and solar is expected to hit 19% by 2025, and those sources are expected to surpass the amount of electricity made from coal this year.\n\nBut green energy must increase radically over the next 11 years to meet U.S. goals. And those projects are becoming harder to build.\n\nIn the past decade, about 180 counties got their first commercial wind-power project. But in the same period, more than twice as many blocked wind development. And while solar power has found more broad acceptance, 2023 was the first year to see almost as many individual counties block new solar projects as the ones adding their first project.\n\nThe result: Some of the nation\u2019s areas with the best sources of wind and solar power have now been boxed out.\n\nBecause large-scale solar and wind projects typically are built outside city limits, USA TODAY\u2019s analysis focuses on restrictions by the county-level governments that have jurisdiction. In a few cases, such as Connecticut, Tennessee and Vermont, entire states have implemented near-statewide restrictions.\n\nWhile 15% of America\u2019s counties might sound like a small portion, the trend has significant consequences, says Jeff Danielson, a former four-term Iowa state senator now with the Clean Grid Alliance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 15% of the most highly productive areas to develop wind and solar,\u201d he said. \u201cOur overall goals are going to be difficult to achieve if the answer is \u2018No\u2019 in county after county.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s green-energy deadline now sits just 11 years away. But even if politicians fail to meet that goal, another clock is ticking.\n\nLast year, 2023, was the warmest in recorded history, warmer than any other in 125,000 years. And with the climate\u2019s rising temperature comes rising risks: stronger hurricanes in the Atlantic, more severe cloudbursts in storms across the continent, increasing drought on the Great Plains, larger wildfires in the West.\n\nConstruction isn\u2019t happening fast enough to meet the country\u2019s green energy needs, said Grace Wu, a professor of energy resources at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about what\u2019s ahead,\u201d she said.\n\nThe shift to green energy, and the rise of bans\n\nThe transition to green energy involves a profound national shift, a move from power plants that mostly burned coal, then natural gas, to new wind and solar installations. That also means shifting much of the nation\u2019s energy generation to new regions, specifically the large wind belt down the middle of the country and the sunny southeast and southwest.\n\n\u201cClean energy\u201d includes other emissions-free sources such as nuclear (18%) and hydropower (6%). But both of those are controversial in their own right and unlikely to see major expansion in the U.S.\n\nAnd sources such as rooftop solar panels on houses or businesses, while helpful, provide just a tiny fraction of the total power supply.\n\nIn the Northeast, several coastal states have instead made plans to rely on offshore wind turbines. But a wave of disinformation in 2023, falsely claiming offshore wind projects killed whales, resulted in a sharp decline in public support for offshore wind.\n\nThe only likely way to shift away from fossil fuels quickly is a sharp increase in solar and wind farms big enough to replace power plants, each one powering tens of thousands of homes.\n\nThe total amount of energy a solar plant can make varies widely based on size and location. The average-size solar plant today can power about 20,000 homes. A field of wind turbines can be similar, as each turbine can power about 1,000 homes.\n\nThe first large-scale wind farm in the U.S. started running nearly 50 years ago, in the aftermath of a global oil crisis. Built in Southern California, it powered more than 4,000 homes.\n\nWind power gained momentum in the early 2000s thanks to better technology and tax incentives.\n\nBut the number of new wind projects opening annually peaked in the early 2010s, according to inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and has slowed since then.\n\nWind power is expected to grow 11% by 2025 from last year\u2019s levels. In the past 10 years, 183 counties saw their first wind project come online. However, USA TODAY\u2019s analysis found that in the same period, nearly 375 counties have essentially blocked new wind development. That\u2019s almost as many as the 508 counties \u2013 out of 3,144 total in the U.S. \u2013 currently home to an operational wind turbine.\n\nUtility-scale solar plants, using solar panels that have grown dramatically more efficient, have proliferated in the last decade. The U.S. added a record 33 gigawatts of solar power in 2023 and solar is expected to grow 75% by 2025. More than 1,000 counties now host solar farms.\n\n\u201cA solar panel in my part of Michigan produces 70% of the solar power the same panel in Phoenix, Arizona, does. Most people would expect the difference to be much bigger,\u201d said Sarah Mills, a professor of urban planning at the University of Michigan who studies energy policy and land use.\n\nHowever, opposition also has shot up, according to USA TODAY\u2019s analysis. Of the 116 counties implementing bans or impediments to utility-scale solar plants, half did so in 2023 alone.\n\nThis surge in obstacles is unprecedented since green-energy technology gained broad acceptance.\n\n\u201cThe local regulation landscape for renewables is changing quickly,\u201d said Tamara Ogle, a member of the land use team at Purdue University Extension, who inventoried Indiana\u2019s renewable energy ordinances in 2022.\n\nDespite growing hostility, green energy can be an economic windfall in places that welcome it.\n\nMuch as places like Texas and Alaska grew rich when drilling companies struck oil, solar and wind power can bring in both construction work and cash, in the form of leases and tax revenue from the power plants.\n\n\u201cYou're talking hundreds of millions of dollars of economic impact in these counties, many of which are shrinking,\u201d said Alan Anderson, who heads the energy practice at the law firm of Polsinelli in Kansas City, Missouri. Rural counties lower their property tax bills, Anderson said, when green energy tax money flows in.\n\nIn all, the nation will get about 12% of its electricity supply from wind, and about 7% from utility scale solar by 2025.\n\nBut that\u2019s a long way from the 60 to 80% we\u2019ll need in addition to nuclear and hydrpower.\n\nAnd building any energy source is a compromise, said Thomas Daniels, a professor of land and environmental planning at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Weitzman School of Design. Wind and solar do require land, just as coal, oil and natural gas did, but the acreage is larger \u2013 there\u2019s no getting around it.\n\n\u201cNot every project can be no-impact,\u201d he said. So backlash against new power plants is \u201ca normal human reaction.\u201d\n\nMany forms of impediments\n\nLocal obstructions sometimes take the form of outright bans or moratoriums. But other rules also block green power: burdensome limits on size, height or locations. Some places put caps on total size, or implement complex rules that prevent solar from replacing specially designated areas such as \u201cprime farmland.\u201d\n\nThese limits can mean wind or solar farms are allowed in theory, but may be impossible to build in reality.\n\nUSA TODAY\u2019s analysis considered a variety of limits to determine which ones were restrictive enough to effectively block new power projects. One example is a \u201csetback\u201d requirement for wind turbines. The larger the setback \u2013 a mandatory distance from a neighboring property line or structure \u2013 the larger the plot of land required for each turbine and the fewer that can be built.\n\n\u201cEvery year we\u2019re seeing restrictions that are more severe,\u201d said Matt Eisenson, senior fellow at Columbia Law School\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. \u201cYou now have counties in Nebraska that have 3-mile setbacks for wind turbines, so if you have a square plot of land, you would need 36 square miles to site a single wind turbine.\u201d\n\nSolar farms might be allowed, but subject to size restrictions that make them impractical. For example, in Virginia, 14 counties have set maximums on either the percentage of land or the number of acres that can be covered in solar panels, significantly restricting the size and number of possible projects.\n\nOther jurisdictions create shadow bans of sorts. Projects might not technically be banned, but officials simply reject all green energy plans on a case-by-case basis.\n\nUSA TODAY\u2019s analysis began with data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Columbia University\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, then built on it with more than a year\u2019s worth of tracking federal data, local government filings and media reports from across the country. The methodology and conclusions were vetted by an expert panel.\n\nEarlier research from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found local ordinances through 2021 were responsible for about a 13% reduction in wind capacity and a 2% reduction in solar capacity across the nation. That research likely underestimates the current effects, because of the large number of new impediments USA TODAY found from 2022 and 2023.\n\nUSA TODAY\u2019s findings were supported by research published in late January by the Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nEnergy developers reported one third of the wind and solar siting applications they had submitted in the past five years were canceled, while about half were delayed for six months or more. Zoning issues and community opposition were two of the top reasons.\n\nDevelopers told the researchers opposition to wind and solar projects is becoming more prevalent and more expensive, and said they project this will get worse.\n\n\u201cThere are impacts,\u201d said Anthony Lopez, a senior researcher in the Geospatial Data Science Group at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory\u2019s Strategic Energy Analysis Center. He tracks ordinances governing wind and solar power for the U.S. government and has published extensively on the topic.\n\n\u201cOur models show that when we reduce our nation's wind and solar resources through measures like local ordinances, it could slow down the process of decarbonization and make it much more expensive,\u201d he said\n\nAt the University of Michigan, Mills said that if the windiest and sunniest places say no to large wind turbines and solar farms, developers move on to the next windiest or sunniest places, and then the next \u2013 each time to an area that is less efficient and more expensive.\n\n\u201cOnce you place these restrictions, what\u2019s left is less optimal,\u201d said Mills. \u201cWhat is the cost that we\u2019re willing to pay for social acceptance?\u201d\n\nWhy people want the bans\n\nThe opposition to renewable energy isn't as simple as left vs. right, and it isn't always a matter of big business vs. small activists. There\u2019s no one group fighting renewables \u2013 there are many, with a range of objections.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump often denigrates wind and solar power in his speeches. In December in New Hampshire he said, falsely, that wind farms only last 10 years, that they kill \u201call the birds,\u201d that solar energy isn\u2019t powerful enough to run factories and wind is 42 times more expensive than natural gas.\n\nThere are several national think tanks and groups, many that receive fossil fuel funding, that have been putting out arguments, often false, opposing wind and solar power for years.\n\nBut sometimes, big utility companies that make money with fossil fuels are actually the same utilities seeking to build solar farms or wind turbines.\n\nAnd much of the opposition comes from local activists without obvious ties to national groups.\n\nUSA TODAY visited communities in three states and viewed public meetings in half a dozen others to understand public sentiments for and against green energy proposals.\n\nThe opposition sometimes leads to surprising arguments about property rights, in which some land-owners invoke concepts like a claim to a \"viewshed\" \u2013 views they want free of wind turbines or solar panels. These opponents clash with others who champion a different view of private property rights, saying landowners should be free to build what they want.\n\nAnd while opponents say solar and wind farms destroy the agricultural way of life, farmers themselves are often the ones who want to build green power, saying they\u2019re simply swapping out one crop that requires the sun \u2013 corn or soy \u2013 for another, electricity. For wind, turbines can easily be placed in working fields or rangeland.\n\nThese arguments now create rifts in rural communities nationwide. From California to New York state, proposals have drawn local opposition as virulent as any book-banning controversy, with county board meetings so tense local police and sheriffs deputies are sometimes called to keep things civil.\n\nIn Ohio in December, an anonymously funded group held a catered town hall meeting in Knox County featuring speakers linked to fossil fuel and climate change denial organizations who made many unsupported claims. Representatives of the project were not allowed in.\n\nNational renewable energy opposition points posted online are quickly taken up by people living near proposed projects who use them to fight what they see as a threat to their communities and way of life.\n\nAttend a county zoning or commission meeting and there will most likely be conspiracy theories and wild accusations about the dangers of renewable energy and even questions about whether global warming truly exists \u2013 often the exact same arguments put forth by fossil-fuel funded think tanks.\n\nBut as person after person comes to the podium, another theme develops. Often, the people say they don\u2019t reject the need for renewable power. But whatever their arguments, one sentiment underlies them \u2013 sadness and sometimes anger as they contemplate what feels like a massive change in the place they live and love.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re against renewable energy, I would say we\u2019re against it being forced upon us,\u201d said Coedy Snyder, who lives about three miles from the proposed Oak Run solar farm in Madison County, Ohio.

I think there are more than enough headlines out there already that center on one of the most idolized entertainers in the world: Taylor Swift.\n\nSure, she\u2019s tremendously popular and wealthy, but is she that great?\n\nHer music isn\u2019t my cup of tea (I\u2019m more of a Beatles and Willie Nelson kind of girl). So while I don\u2019t pay much attention to Swift, I admire her business prowess and appreciate the fact she has so many adoring fans.\n\nGood for her, living the American dream.\n\nLeave it to the MAGA crowd to find reasons to despise her for her success \u2013 and influence. This growing Donald Trump-aligned segment of the Republican Party just can\u2019t help itself from trying to make its proponents look downright wacko.\n\nGoing after Swift \u2013 and creating kooky conspiracy theories about her, her NFL player boyfriend Travis Kelce, and deep-state Democratic plots \u2013 is sure to backfire with her millions of avid fans.\n\nTrump's jealous of Taylor Swift, throws tantrum\n\nYet Trump \u2013 the increasingly likely Republican presidential nominee \u2013 has signaled he\u2019s jealous of the superstar singer and her big following, and has posited that he\u2019s \u201cmore popular\u201d than Swift, according to Rolling Stone. He\u2019s also claimed he has more committed fans.\n\nSo Trump\u2019s insecurity has energized MAGA sympathizers in the media and political world to rally around him, even though it makes them sound completely nuts.\n\nThat pretty much sums up this election. Gone are the days of substantive debates over ideas. Welcome to the new era (yes, I\u2019m using that word on purpose) of fandom-infused politics.\n\nBecause let\u2019s face it: Trump is a celebrity, just like Swift. He\u2019s a reality TV star turned former president trying to stage a comeback. In our culture, stardom holds undue power.\n\nTrump isn't conservative:If bowing to Trump is the GOP's new 'conservatism,' good luck winning any more elections\n\nIt\u2019s downright amusing that Newsmax host Greg Kelly recently called Swift's idolization by fans a \u201csin.\u201d\n\nHave MAGA fans looked in the mirror recently? Their cult-like obsession with their leader \u2013 no matter what he does or says \u2013 is the definition of idolatry.\n\nCould Swift save Biden?\n\nEveryone who\u2019s being honest knows that President Joe Biden is a weak candidate. He\u2019s hugely unpopular, even among Democrats, and his age of 81 is showing more every day.\n\nCould Swift and her loyal band of \u201cSwifties\u201d save him come November?\n\nNo doubt, her endorsement of Biden could help energize some of her fans to go out and vote. She endorsed him in 2020, too.\n\nBut it\u2019s ludicrous to think that there is some huge conspiracy theory involving the Pentagon to harness Swift and her relationship with Kelce (who has \u2013 gasp \u2013 advocated getting the COVID vaccine that Trump spearheaded, which must mean he\u2019s in cahoots with Big Pharma) in an effort to tilt the election in Biden\u2019s favor.\n\nI wish I were making this up. That\u2019s the rhetoric in some Republican circles right now, however.\n\nTrump or Haley?Trump wins New Hampshire, but if Haley drops out Democrats will get their wish. Don't do it.\n\nSome non-MAGA conservatives are trying to push back against the madness, including former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who lost her seat in Congress after she turned against Trump following Jan. 6, 2001.\n\nCheney called Swift a \u201cnational treasure\u201d on social media. That\u2019s a bit much.\n\nBut one thing is true: Swift is not a psy-op out to torpedo Trump. (If all it takes is one singer to turn the election, perhaps Republicans should find a better candidate...)\n\nAnd if MAGA true believers keep trying to spread these farcical lies, expect more voters to flee the GOP.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

But supporting an adult child can get costly, financial planners say. And parents need to make sure their own financial needs are met.\n\nRoughly half of under-30 adults live with their parents, prior Pew research has shown. That figure has spiked dramatically over the years.\n\nAmericans are marrying later, and waiting longer to have children. Researchers say those trends point to a new life stage, tucked between adolescence and full adulthood. Some term it \u201cemerging adulthood.\u201d\n\n'Snowplow' parents clear a financial path for adult children\n\nYoung adults face myriad economic challenges in 2024 America. College costs and student debt loads are rising. House prices have soared. Mercurial inflation and interest rates have vexed consumers.\n\nLearn more: Best debt consolidation loans\n\nParents, for their part, seem ever more inclined to carry on with parenting well past the age a child exits childhood, removing every obstacle in their path. Some researchers call it \u201csnowplow\u201d parenting.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s move everything out of the way, so our kids can walk perfectly down the street,\u201d said Jonathan Abramowitz, a psychology professor at the University of North Carolina.\n\nIt\u2019s easier than ever to pay an adult child\u2019s bills, whether the kid lives with you or not. Earlier generations mostly paid their bills by mail. Now, everything\u2019s on apps or online.\n\nPew reports that 28% of adults ages 18 to 34 received financial help with household expenses, such as groceries or utilities, in the past year; 25% got a parent\u2019s help with a cellphone bill or streaming subscriptions; 17% with rent or a mortgage; 15% with medical expenses; and 11% with education expenses.\n\nFewer than half of adult children report financial independence\n\nFewer than half of young adults claim complete financial independence from their parents, Pew reports. Even past 30, one-third of adult children rely on their parents to pay at least some of the bills.\n\nThe Pew study, published on January 25, draws on a survey of 4,512 adult children and parents.\n\nOften, parental aid to aging children is relatively trivial.\n\nJohn Maxwell, a lawyer in St. Louis, is father to three 30-something daughters.\n\nWhen they finished school, he told them, in effect, \u201cYou\u2019re on your own, kiddo.\u201d They got jobs, moved out, and learned to pay their way.\n\nBut not entirely. The Maxwell parents still pay for a family cellphone plan and some streaming services. Each year, the parents cover airfare or hotel bills for a family vacation.\n\nThe father lent money to his eldest daughter when she was starting out. \u201cBut it was a loan, not a gift,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that is where the Maxwells draw the line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough world out there,\u201d John Maxwell said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to learn to stand on your own two feet.\u201d\n\nFor aging parents, helping adult children is 'Parenting 101'\n\nFor many aging parents, supporting an adult child seems the very essence of parenting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d go to the ends of the earth to make sure our children are safe and happy,\u201d said Christopher Lyman, a certified financial planner in Newtown, Pennsylvania, who advises couples with adult children.\n\nParents who support adult children see their progeny emerging into a different world than the one they knew as young adults, said Teresa Bailey, a certified financial planner in Nashville.\n\n\u201cThey feel like the economy is different now, and the world is different, and it\u2019s more difficult for somebody to be fully financially independent,\u201d she said.\n\nParental aid is fine, she said, so long as the parents can afford it. Some aging parents continue supporting adult children at the peril of their own retirement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing we check,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you spending on your children and putting yourself in a situation where they will have to spend on you, because you haven\u2019t saved enough for retirement?\"\n\nBailey projects a couple\u2019s budget to age 90, showing them where their finances are likely to be, based on their patterns of saving and spending.\n\nFor couples who spend heavily on adult children, she said, the exercise can yield \u201ca lightbulb experience.\u201d\n\nMany parents who aid adult children hurt their own finances\n\nIn the new Pew study, more than one-third of parents who provided financial help to adult children said that doing so hurt their own finances.\n\n\u201cOften, the ones who are providing the support aren\u2019t the ones who can afford to provide the support,\u201d Lyman said.\n\nFor adult children on the receiving end of parental largesse, the help can come as a blessing or a curse.\n\nIn some circumstances, parental aid can be a godsend: A new graduate struggling with student loans, or a first-time home buyer who can\u2019t quite make the down payment.\n\nYet, experts say, the help must eventually come to an end.\n\n\u201cIt does have a downside,\u201d Abramowitz said, \u201cand that is, it can reinforce that need for dependence. Young adults, they get stuck, because the parents are protecting them, and the kids never learn how to launch.\u201d\n\nParents who support adult children \u201chave the best intentions at heart,\u201d Abramowitz said.\n\nStill, every so often, he said, they should ask themselves this question: \u201cWhen does it get in the way of the kid being able to move on with their life?\u201d"}

She didn't expect her calling would be controversial.\n\n\"I felt my friends and family were going to be excited for me,\" she said about her 2019 epiphany. \"But I didn\u2019t get that reaction. It was like, 'What? Why do you want to go there?'\"\n\nCochrane lives in deep red Texas, south of Dallas in Ellis County, where Donald Trump won more than two-thirds of the vote in 2016 and 2020. To Cochrane, helping asylum-seekers sounded like a Biblical call to welcome the stranger. To her conservative community, she sounded like a liberal.\n\n\"I felt very lonely,\" she said.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWhite evangelical Christians helped deliver Trump's 2016 presidential victory in a campaign fueled by his \"build the wall\" mantra. They favored him again in 2020. Surveys suggest white evangelical Christians are lining up behind him in 2024, even as he calls for \"the largest deportation program in American history.\"\n\nBut there are signs of fissures. A small, but growing, group of evangelical Christian women like Cochrane are questioning the narrative of \"invasion\" at the southern border. They're wondering why lawmakers can't reform the nation's immigration laws in a way that could both enhance border security and treat people humanely.\n\nThey say they're returning to the roots of their faith: hewing as closely as possible to the Gospel.\n\n\"The Bible doesn\u2019t have anything to say about U.S. immigration policy, but it does have a lot to say about the immigrant and the refugee,\" said Bri Stensrud, director of Women of Welcome, a community of more than 130,000 evangelical Christian women. Group members are, by and large, conservative, anti-abortion and trying to square the Republican party's razor-wire immigration politics with the compassion that their faith demands of them.\n\nFor a time, Cochrane stopped talking out loud about her own \"calling.\"\n\nInstead, she and a trusted friend drove 480 miles to the border and volunteered with local Catholic organizations providing aid to asylum-seekers. Back home, she retreated online, searching for like-minded women.\n\nThat's when she found Women of Welcome on Facebook.\n\n\"I joined the private group immediately,\" Cochrane said. \"I felt like I was safe there to talk about things.\"\n\nMore:'Tell the family we're going to kill them tomorrow': Migration crisis unveils new horrors\n\nPro-life values, compassion for immigrants\n\nStensrud lives in Colorado, describes herself as conservative and worked for years in the anti-abortion movement. In the first year of the Trump administration in 2017, she got a call from a mentor, challenging her: Did her commitment to pro-life values extend to the lives of migrants? Would she be interested in taking the helm of a new project, called Women of Welcome?\n\nAt the time, World Relief \u2013 the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals \u2013 had conducted a study on the immigration views of self-identified evangelical Christians.\n\nThe results showed that evangelical Christian views on immigration were more influenced by media than the Bible. But broken down by gender, the researchers concluded, women showed higher levels of compassion than men.\n\n\"The research said there is a pocket of women out there who want to learn about the issues from a Biblical perspective, not a political perspective,\" said Stensrud, who is also the author of the book, \"Start with Welcome: The Journey Toward a Confident and Compassionate Immigration Conversation,\" which publishes Tuesday.\n\nStensrud agreed to travel to Oaxaca, Mexico, on a trip led by World Relief and the nonpartisan National Immigration Forum, which together support Women of Welcome.\n\nThe group visited a migrant shelter for unaccompanied children. She felt judgmental before even arriving, she told a Christian podcaster in 2021: How could a mother ever leave her child behind?\n\nBut the migrants' stories of survival were worse than anything she \u2013 a privileged, white, Christian mother living in the U.S. \u2013 could ever have imagined.\n\n\"I thought I was being holistically pro-life. I thought I was including it all,\" Stensrud said on an episode of The Happy Hour with Jamie Ivey. But by the end of the trip, she said, \"I looked like I got hit by a semi.\"\n\nShe stepped into a storage room to break away from the group. \"And I just started bawling uncontrollably,\" she said. \"I was so grieved. I\u2019ve been in this movement for so long. I thought to myself, 'If my girlfriends could see what I see they would be just as grieved, too.'\"\n\nShe took the offer to lead the Women of Welcome community.\n\nSeven years later, Stensrud has led evangelical Christian women on dozens of similar immersion trips to border communities in Texas and California to volunteer with migrants and aid workers, and meet Border Patrol agents and faith leaders. Women of Welcome's original Bible study has been downloaded over 125,000 times, and the private Facebook group Cochrane joined in 2019 now has more than 5,000 members.\n\nMembers take turns reading Scripture in videos on the group's social media, including the verse from Matthew 25:35, \"For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in.\"\n\nEvangelical women 'going against the grain' on immigration\n\nWomen of Welcome doesn't have a political agenda. The community explicitly doesn't talk presidential politics. It's been challenging enough to encourage evangelical Christian women to consider perspectives that clash with their political identity, Stensrud said.\n\nShe tells them, \"Your compassion isn't political. It's meant to be prophetic.\"\n\nTheir reluctance to take their compassion into the political sphere is frustrating for some Latino evangelicals, who for decades have been active advocates for immigration reform, said Rev. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition.\n\nUnlike in white communities, many Latino families of mixed immigration status don't have the luxury of distance from the issue, he said. They live with the constant threat of a loved one being deported.\n\n\"We believe Scripture is clear in telling us to welcome the stranger,\" he said. \"The history of evangelical advocacy on immigration is grounded in the Latino immigrant church. We Latino evangelicals, we care about the economy and people\u2019s human rights. We want a balanced approach. We\u2019re politically homeless.\"\n\nBut white evangelical Christianity is now so intertwined with MAGA politics and anti-immigrant rhetoric that there is little room for dissent or compassion, said Samuel Perry, a professor of sociology at the University of Oklahoma who also grew up in an evangelical community.\n\n\"Is it radical in terms of the teaching of the Bible? Absolutely not,\" Perry said. But Cochrane and the Women of Welcome group \"are swimming against the current of where white evangelicalism is going. I can see why they feel out of place in their communities.\"\n\nPerry said it's unlikely that this \"vocal exception\" among evangelicals will move the political needle in the 2024 election. Up against a Democrat, evangelical support for Trump has hovered above 80% for years, Perry said.\n\nLike Cochrane, Stensrud has witnessed firsthand the pushback that women in evangelical communities face when they want to go deeper on the immigration issue.\n\nStensrud said she tells them, \"It's going to be hard. When you develop an outward compassion for immigrants and refugees, it\u2019s likely your husband isn\u2019t going to understand. Your friends might say, \u2018It looks like you\u2019re turning into a liberal.\u2019\"\n\n\"That is what people don\u2019t understand about conservative communities,\" she said. \"Going against the grain is not something you do.\"\n\nShe is preaching the idea that compassionate-minded evangelical Christians could find common ground with progressives on issues that she says fall into the \"sanctity of life\" category.\n\nSomething just happened in Congress that suggests Stensrud may be right. Two groups on opposite sides of the abortion issue, Antiabortion Americans United for Life and the pro-choice Center for American Progress, both threw their support behind a bipartisan deal to boost the child tax credit to families. It passed the House in late January with sweeping support from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAs Latino evangelical Christians continue to press for immigration reform, Salguero warned against giving newcomers to the movement too much credit. But, he added, \"We welcome and celebrate all allies. At the end of the day, evangelicals of every stripe, color and generation will have to weigh how important immigration is as a voting issue among the long list \u2014 because we are not one-issue voters.\"\n\nFor her part, Cochrane has invited members of her church to her calling. She has helped organize mission trips to the Texas-Mexico border, and this spring, her 15-year-old granddaughter plans to accompany her on a \"grandparents\" mission to South Texas \u2013 the first member of her family to join her.\n\nShe tears up at the thought.\n\n\"I will tell you,\" she said, \"I believe God allowed me to see through the eyes of Christ and when you see things that way, when you see women and children and men \u2013 and you learn their names \u2013 it\u2019s totally different. You see the human side that deserves dignity and, for me, compassion.\"\n\nMore:Nikki Haley is framing motherhood as an advantage, not a drawback.

And, he has a warning for those calling on Haley to drop out: don't underestimate her.\n\nWhile prominent conservative activists and GOP officials \u2212 least of all former President Donald Trump \u2212 are bellowing for Haley to exit, supporters of hers like Maxey, who helped organize a fundraiser when she first ran for governor in 2010, see glimmers of an alternative pathway to victory.\n\n\"She can win this if she stays in there,\" Maxey, 67, said. \"Trump's going to mess up at some point, and so she's going to be in the driver's seat.\"\n\nThere's a method to Haley's South Carolina bid. In part, she's aiming to be the last person standing should Trump's balloon burst at any point during the 2024 election cycle. It's also a test of whether there's an appetite for an alternative to the former president, who has shown electoral cracks in his armor even when winning Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nShe's drilling that message into voters' heads about Trump\u2019s character and acuity while zipping coast-to-coast raising campaign cash to remain competitive after pledging to shrink his enormous 26-point lead in South Carolina.\n\nDuring a campaign stop Thursday night in Hilton Head Island, an affluent resort town on the east coast of South Carolina, Haley sought to make that same case before true believers who assembled at a shopping plaza.\n\nVoters including Marriett Campbell, a 78-year-old retired paralegal, listened in. While she voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, she can't get past the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\n\u201cIt was treason,\u201d she said. \u201cI have 11 grandchildren. And I cannot say I want you to be like him.\u201d\n\nStaying in the race means Haley continues to accumulate delegates in states in which independents can vote in the GOP primary, which her campaign outlined as its path to victory in a recent memo. Some anti-Trump Republicans have cast a possible scenario of Haley emerging at the GOP convention in July, which experts say would ignite a whole different civil war within the party.\n\nHaley's campaign maintains that she plans to stay in the race until at least March 5, when 16 states hold their contests on what is known as Super Tuesday.\n\n\"After Super Tuesday, we will have a very good picture of where this race stands,\" Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney wrote in the Jan. 23 memo. \"Until then, everyone should take a deep breath.\"\n\nDemocrat Anton Gunn, who served with Haley in the South Carolina legislature, described his former colleague as a \"great political athlete\" who has the ability to pull off an upset. He noted how she shocked the entire state in 2010 after receiving key endorsements from prominent GOP figures, such as Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin.\n\n\"For the Trump acolytes, they can support him all they want. Nikki is going to be around for a while, and I don't suspect that she'll get out anytime soon or drop out,\" he said. \"She only gets stronger the more he attacks her. That's just her thing.\"\n\nBeating Biden and a return to normal\n\nHaley pitched her true-and-tested list of accomplishments as governor this past Thursday in front of supporters at a modern and cozy barbecue joint with exposed ceilings and wood-paneled walls in one of Hilton Head Island's oldest plazas, steps away from the public Coligny beach.\n\nBut if you were expecting a cookout and the smoky aroma of burning apple and cherry wood and the distinct mustard simmering sauces, there was none there. Instead, the restaurant had stopped service for the evening, except for drinks at its outdoor bar.\n\nHaley touted her conservative policy chops including cutting unemployment, passing strict anti-immigration laws, fighting for pension reform and cutting taxes.\n\n\u201cBy the time I left, we were named the friendliest state in the country. The most patriotic state in the country,\u201d Haley said.\n\nPart of Haley's electability argument is that she is the preferable candidate to take back the White House.\n\nA Jan. 31 Quinnipiac University poll shows Trump trailing President Joe Biden by 6% and also has her beating the Democratic incumbent by 5%.\n\n\u201cHaley needs to convince conservatives that Trump is not one of them,\u201d Republican strategist William F. B. O'Reilly said in an interview. \u201cHe's a narcissistic populist whose agenda can turn on a dime, depending on his mood on any given morning.\u201d\n\nThe idea of Trump once again being the Republican Party's standard bearer was not palatable to Neal Wasserman and his wife Leslie St. Amant.\n\nThe couple, who spends their time between Massachusetts and South Carolina, are former Republicans who changed their political affiliation to independents after Trump won.\n\n\u201cShe (Haley) has the mental fortitude and character to discuss what's important versus attacking individuals for either their race, how they look or how they dress,\u201d said St. Amant, 53, a personal trainer and nutritionist who works with cancer patients.\n\nBut casting herself as the plan B candidate with a deposit of delegates could be tricky, especially if there's no path to victory through South Carolina \u2212 a winner-take-all state in which Haley could wind up winning zero delegates if she is unable to beat Trump.\n\nBacked by the emphatic Make America Great Again movement, Trump and his allies are browbeating Haley to drop out, which is building up a cacophony of conservatives who resent her staying in the race.\n\nThe Trump campaign also has flexed multiple endorsements from the Palmetto State, including Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who Haley appointed, while branding her as a \"war monger\" who is weak on immigration.\n\nTaking on the Trump machine\n\nSince her 11-point loss in New Hampshire, Haley's pitch has been two-fold.\n\nFor starters, she has zeroed in Trump's mental acuity and age, which mirrors many of the right-wing attacks that spotlight anxiety about Biden.\n\nHaley also is leaning into a reminder for voters about the former president's ongoing legal troubles as a pain point for his campaign.\n\nShe has reserved $4 million in airtime in South Carolina that she is using on attack ads and commercials about the conservative legislation she signed and policies she enacted as governor.\n\nHaley leaned into issues on Thursday that are likely to grab the attention of more conservative-minded voters.\n\nAmid attacks from the Trump campaign that she is weak on immigration, Haley talked up an idea about a national E-Verify, which will require every business to prove that the people they hire are \u201cin the country legally.\u201d\n\nShe also promised to defund sanctuary cities, ending the current practice of releasing migrants while they await proceedings in immigration court to \u201ccatch and deport.\u201d\n\nHaley had been pining for a two-person race against Trump, suggesting repeatedly on the trail in Iowa and New Hampshire that in an un-congested field, she could beat him in South Carolina.\n\nYet, the abrupt exit of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis from the race last month, and other candidate departures following the Iowa Caucus, may have boosted Trump by helping him win back wayward supporters as much as it helped her.\n\nA new Monmouth University-Washington Post poll of South Carolina voters shows Trump with 58% support in South Carolina. He had 46% in September. Haley trails at 32%. She polled at 18% in the September survey.\n\nDuring an appearance last Sunday on \"Meet the Press,\" Haley appeared set a new bar for how well she must do that emphasized \"building momentum\" over winning her home state.\n\n\"I need to show that I'm stronger in South Carolina than New Hampshire. Does that have to be a win? I don't think that necessarily has to be a win,\" she said.\n\n\"But it certainly has to be better than what I did in New Hampshire, and it certainly has to be close.\"\n\nShe said her team must show voters and donors that, \"we're continuing to narrow that margin\" against Trump leading into Super Tuesday.\n\nA Democratic bailout for Haley?\n\nOne question hanging over the South Carolina primaries is what role Democrats could play in determining Haley\u2019s fate.\n\nThat\u2019s because voters can participate in either party\u2019s contest, which means Democrats who did not cast a ballot in Saturday's party primary are eligible to participate in the GOP contest on Feb. 24.\n\nThis prospect has gotten more traction ever since independents and unaffiliated voters showed up for Haley during the New Hampshire primary.\n\nHaley herself has said she is open to support from Democrats who have lost confidence in Biden.\n\n\"If conservative Democrats are saying, I want to come back home to the Republican Party because they left it, I want them back,\" she said during January town hall hosted by CNN.\n\nSkeptics abound, however, at the possibility that a significant enough portion Democrats will skip their own party\u2019s primary to rescue a former governor who many opposed when she was in office.\n\n\u201cNikki Haley is just as bad as Trump, if not worse. I call her the mother of MAGA,\u201d Christale Spain, chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said in an interview.\n\nSpain, the first Black woman to lead the state party, said they have been working overtime to discourage Democratic voters from joining Haley\u2019s coalition.\n\nMonths before the primary, state Democrats hammered Haley by reminding people how she blocked expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOthers have pointed to her support for a 6-week abortion ban, and her failing to mention slavery when asked about what sparked the Civil War.\n\n\"Nikki Haley may seem normal standing next to Trump \u2212 anybody can do that,\" Spain said. \"For us they're all MAGA, and there's nothing for a Democratic voter on that side.\"\n\nAs the state party and Biden reelection campaign pushed their backers to turn up to the polls, Haley has made no overtures to Democrats in the state to wait to cast a ballot until the GOP primary to bolster her numbers against Trump.\n\nInstead, she is running ads touting her conservative credentials in the deep red state that has a Republican governor, attorney general, secretary of state and state legislature.\n\nGunn, a veteran campaign strategist in the state who worked on then-candidate Barack Obama's campaign in 2008, said South Carolina Democrats were far more focused on their new position as the national party's first official primary in the nation.\n\n\"I don't think it's worth their campaign spending any energy on Democratic voters. They need to spend all of their time focused on Republican voters,\" he said.\n\nThe plan B candidate option isn't a guarantee\n\nA candidate needs 1,215 delegates to be the Republican nominee for president, and at the moment Trump holds a slim lead that is expected to balloon in March.\n\nThe idea that Haley should stick it out and rake in more delegates until the GOP convention in July to emerge as the alternate should Trump be toppled by his legal woes is largely wishful thinking, strategists say.\n\nBeing the last candidate standing won't guarantee her the nomination given \u201chow profoundly the party is Trump's party in this day and age,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a former Republican campaign operative and co-founder of Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group.\n\nIf something were to happen to Trump politically or otherwise, he said, his delegates could decide to back another candidate who is not even in the race \u2013 and leave Haley high and dry.\n\nHaley would likely face an avalanche of candidates who would jump in the race at the convention.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of scenarios where that plays, one way or the other,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nOther Republican strategists dismiss ideas about gaming the convention, saying the Haley\u2019s campaign best shot is building a coalition of voters fretting over Trump, starting with traditional conservatives troubled by the MAGA movement.\n\nO'Reilly, the GOP strategist, said she should continue pounding away at Trump's volatile behavior, and spotlight how chaos and conservatism are antithetical to one another.\n\n\u201cHaley should also keep hitting Trump on his broken promises from 2016, most notably his dramatic deficit spending,\u201d he said.\n\nHaley will have to continue to lean into the electability argument, which was bolstered by the recent Quinnipiac survey.\n\nThat poll shows in a hypothetical one-on-one matchup, for instance, Haley leading Biden among independents by 16%. The same survey shows independents giving Biden a 12% edge over Trump.\n\nAmong female voters, the Quinnipiac poll finds, support for Biden against Trump has increased. The president now holds a 58-36% lead with women, up from December when it was 53-41%.\n\nWilson said as the GOP primary in South Carolina comes more into focus, Haley will have to ramp up a stark message to voters with those alarms.\n\n\u201cIf I were her, I would frame Trump\u2019s potential return as something that will put violence front and center in American life,\" he said."}

Nikki Haley, from his \"Make American Great Again\" movement.\n\nTrump has largely run the party since his successful campaign in 2016, but his degree of control has waxed and waned, especially after his 2020 defeat and the failed insurrection of Jan 6, 2021.\n\nNow he is trying to go further in flexing his influence, even as he still faces primary challenges and polls that show large groups of Republicans and moderate voters who are concerned with with his four sets of criminal charges and other unprecedented hurdles in the 2024 campaign.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"You can declare that the Republican Party is never going to go back to those days of weak establishment candidates,\" Trump told supporters a day before his Jan. 23 win in the New Hampshire primary, a follow-up to his victory in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nJeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said Trump is \"certainly demonstrating he is the party leader,\" a traditional role for likely nominees.\n\nBut Trump is unique in that he is a former president with a record under scrutiny, including lawsuits and criminal indictments. Re-asserting control of the party frees him to attack President Joe Biden and the Democrats as if he were still an outsider.\n\n\"It's very easy to be a bomb thrower when you're outside the Oval Office,\" Engel said.\n\nTrump tries to kill border bill\n\nIn terms of dictating Republican policy, Trump in recent weeks has gone out out of his way to try and kill the bipartisan bill to address border security.\n\nTrump, who has spoken repeatedly with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says the bill in unnecessary, and that Biden should use the authority he already has to seal the border.\n\nJohnson told reporters Tuesday that it's \"absurd\" to suggest that Republicans are out to kill the bill in order to help Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nSaying that \"our duty is to do right by the American people, to protect the people,\u201d Johnson added that Trump \"understands that we have a responsibility to do here.\"\n\nJohnson and Trump said they speak with each other frequently, affording the ex-president many opportunities to lobby for his agenda. Trump has praised Johnson on the campaign trail, telling supporters in Las Vegas last weekend that \u201cI think he\u2019s going to prove to be a very good speaker. It\u2019s tough when you have a very small majority. Very tough.\"\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trump has signaled support for a number of GOP agenda items, including an investigation of presidential son Hunter Biden and an impeachment drive against President Biden; the proposed impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is believed by Democrats and some Republicans to be part of Trump's effort to make the border a key campaign issue.\n\nBut even as Johnson pushes for immigration reforms, Trump has called on Republican leaders to reject the Senate's compromise.\n\n\u201cI did say that you have, if you\u2019re not gonna get a great border bill, an immigration bill, don\u2019t do a bill,\u201d Trump told reporters this week after meeting with Teamsters leaders. \u201cIf it\u2019s not going to be good, if it\u2019s not going to solve the border problem, don\u2019t do the bill.\"\n\nExpect Trump to continue speaking out, including upcoming negotiations in Washington on a spending bill and the prospect of a government shutdown in March.\n\nIn an interview broadcast Friday on the Fox News Business Network, Trump said he would speak out against Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell because \"I think he's, going to do something to probably help the Democrats - you know, I think, if he lowers interest rates.\"\n\nPowell's job is non-partisan.\n\nDonald Trump isn't the Republican nominee \u2013 yet\n\nNevertheless, as Trump's influence echoes in the halls of Congress, not all Republicans are on board with the former president at least not yet, and he does not have the presidential nomination locked up.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley continues to challenge the former president for the GOP nod, even after his sweeping victories in Iowa and New Hampshire. Haley says the Republican Party and the country need to move on from Trump's \"chaotic\" leadership style.\n\n\"I have a different style and approach from Joe Biden and Donald Trump,\" Haley said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \"No drama. No vendettas. No whining. Just results.\"\n\nHaley is hoping to derail the \"Trump Train\" in her home state of South Carolina, which holds a primary Feb. 24. But polls show Trump with a big lead over Haley in South Carolina and beyond.\n\nTrump threatens to bar Haley supporters\n\nTrump and allies have responded to Haley's continuing campaign with scathing attacks on her, and her donors.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Jan. 24, the day after the New Hampshire primary, Trump said contributors to the Haley campaign \"will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp.\" Trump said: \"We don't want them, and will not accept them.\"\n\nAfter Trump made that threat, Haley called it \"told Fox News: \"That\u2019s a president who\u2019s supposed to serve every person in America and you\u2019re deciding that you\u2019re going to have a club and actually banned people from being in and out of your club.\u201d\n\nShe added: \"I mean, he's totally unhinged.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial page, long-time bastion of conservatism, said Trump's idea of uniting the party appears to be to \"purge Republicans who are still skeptical of him.\"\n\n\"Retribution is at the top of his mind, as he said when launching his campaign,\" said The Journal editorial page. \"Yet this politics of subtraction will make it harder to beat President Biden.\"\n\nTrump's 2024 influence\n\nPresumptive presidential nominees normally become de facto leaders of their parties, with varying degrees of success. But, as with so much in the Trump era, this is different.\n\nFor one thing, Trump is a former president. No former president has come back to win the office again since Grover Cleveland in 1892.\n\nTrump is also a former president who refuses to acknowledge that he lost the 2020 election to Biden, and many of his Republican voters agree with him.\n\nThis particular former president has been assessed more than $88 million in damages to writer E. Jean Carroll, who accused him of rape during an incident in the 1990s. Trump also faces indictments in four criminal cases, including two sets of charges involving efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden.\n\nRecent polls, however, indicated that some Republicans - and many moderates - may turn on Trump if he is convicted in any of these cases.\n\nA Washington Post-Monmouth University Poll released Thursday showed Trump ahead of Haley in South Carolina by a margin of 58%-32%, but also contained some warning signs for the frontrunner.\n\nAsked what the Republican Party should do if Trump is convicted in any of his trials, 60% of respondents said he should remain the nominee - but 36% said he should be replaced by another candidate.\n\n'An inordinate amount of sway'\n\nTrump's success in navigating these problems have helped give him \"an inordinate amount of sway over the party,\" said Lara Brown, author of \"Jockeying for the American Presidency: The Political Opportunism of Aspirants.\"\n\nThis has created a number of anomalies, Brown said.\n\nOne of them: Trump would be weaker now with Republicans if he had won in 2020; he'd be a second term lame duck while other Republicans battled for the nomination.\n\nShe added that Trump's behavior also suggests that he wants the Republicans to help him rather than the party as a whole.\n\n\"Donald Trump cares more about his own future and staying out of prison,\" she said."}

But the high court updated its rules in 2013 to codify the practice that only lawyers can present arguments.\n\nThe justices sometimes get a spectacle. When Larry Flynt, publisher of the pornographic Hustler magazine, was blocked from arguing his own case decades earlier, he shouted obscenities at the justices and was ejected. Protesters have been arrested in rare outbursts inside the courtroom.\n\nThis kind of bombast isn\u2019t expected Thursday. The high court conducts its arguments much more strictly than the lower courts do \u2212 making it less likely Trump will be the star of a similar courthouse drama.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nAt the lower courts, a New York judge scolded Trump for giving campaign speeches from the witness stand in one trial. In another, a federal judge threatened to eject him for making disparaging comments about his opponent that could be heard by the jury. And that was before Trump marched out on his opponent\u2019s closing arguments.\n\nNo 'open mic night' at Supreme Court\n\nDecorum at the Supreme Court also dictates a somber setting. Audience members have been arrested in rare protests inside the chamber. Three women \u2013 Emily Paterson, Nicole Enfield and Rolande Baker \u2013 were charged in November 2022 for protesting an abortion decision.\n\nAfter court convened, Paterson, seated in the south side of the chamber, stood up and shouted a denunciation of the court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Police escorted her out. Then Baker, seated in the north side, stood and shouted for women to vote. After she was escorted out, Enfield in the center back stood and loudly urged a restoration of a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\nEach of the three pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to nearly six months' probation. The maximum penalty under the statute was 60 days in jail and a $5,000 fine.\n\n\u201cThe defendants\u2019 actions severely undermined the respect and reverence our highest court deserves,\u201d U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves said in a court filing. \u201cWere such conduct allowed to go unpunished, the court would quickly cease to be a place where the most important legal disputes in our nation are adjudicated under procedures enacted to ensure fairness and, instead, become a sort of \u2018open mic night\u2019 for citizens to voice their personal views.\u201d\n\nAppeals court upholds law against disturbing Supreme Court with a 'harangue' or 'oration'\n\nFive people \u2013 Belinda Rodriguez, Matthew Kresling, Yasmina Mrabet, Richard Saffle and David Bronstein \u2013 were charged in 2015 after standing one at a time and either shouting or singing to protest a previous campaign-finance decision. Their message on April Fool\u2019s Day was for the justices to ensure free and fair elections.\n\nAfter the fourth protester \u2013 Saffle \u2013 was escorted out, Chief Justice John Roberts warned the audience against further demonstrations.\n\n\u201cAnyone else interested in talking will be admonished that it\u2019s within the authority of this court to punish such disturbances by criminal contempt,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nThe five protesters challenged the charge that they disrupted the court with a \u201charangue\u201d or \u201coration\u201d as unconstitutionally vague. A federal judge agreed.\n\nBut the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law, ruling that a \u201charangue\u201d or \u201coration\u201d disturb the court.\n\n\u201cThis core meaning is delivering speeches of various kinds to persons within the Supreme Court\u2019s building and grounds, in a manner that threatens to disturb the operations and decorum of the court,\u201d the three-judge panel said.\n\nLarry Flynt booted from court, still won case\n\nThe late Flynt, who referred to himself as the \u201cKing of Smut,\u201d challenged First Amendment boundaries repeatedly \u2013 and won a landmark Supreme Court decision despite his behavior.\n\nHis December 1987 hearing appealed the verdict in a lawsuit by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell over an advertising parody in Hustler. The ad suggested Falwell had an incestuous relationship with his mother.\n\nFalwell sued successfully in federal court for libel and emotional distress and won $150,000 in compensatory and punitive damages. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict.\n\nFlynt was kicked out of his own argument at the Supreme Court after shouting obscenities at the justices.\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment is supposed to protect offensive speech,\u201d Flynt told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 1998. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to offend anybody, you don\u2019t need the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court voted 8-0 for Flynt and threw out the verdict. The court ruled public figures couldn\u2019t collect damages for a \"patently offensive\" parody that reasonable people would never consider factual.\n\n\u201cWere we to hold otherwise, there can be little doubt that political cartoonists and satirists would be subjected to damages awards without any showing that their work falsely defamed its subject,\u201d Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote.\n\nTrump appearances in lower courts drew rebukes\n\nThe high court promises a much more subdued arena than Trump's two recent civil trials.\n\nIn a civil fraud trial, New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron, who presided over the state trial, fined Trump a combined $15,000 for violating gag orders against criticizing his clerk in internet posts.\n\nEngoron also beseeched Trump\u2019s lawyer to control his client during testimony, saying \u201cthis is not a political rally.\u201d\n\nIn the federal defamation case, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan warned Trump against conferring with his lawyers loudly enough to be heard by the jury.\n\n\u201cYou just can't control yourself in this circumstance, apparently,\u201d Kaplan told Trump.\n\nThe judge threatened to throw out Trump after he repeatedly made comments disparaging Carroll\u2019s testimony.\n\n\"Mr. Trump, I hope I don't have to consider excluding you from the trial,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI understand you're probably eager for me to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would love it,\u201d Trump responded.\n\nTrump stood up and walked out on the closing argument of Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan. The jury later ordered him to pay Carroll $83.3 million, a decision he vowed to appeal.\n\nFor his part, Trump has expressed optimism in the court. He appointed three of the nine members: Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\n\u201cHopefully this will be an easy decision,\u201d Trump said Jan. 18 in an all-caps social media post, referring to another case expected to reach the high court about whether he is immune from criminal prosecution. \u201cGod bless the Supreme Court!\u201d\n\nElection threats:Threats against election workers spiked after 2020, fueling concerns about recruiting, retaining key workers"}

If you'd like to contribute to our future reporting and share your experience as a source, you can click here to fill out this quick form.\n\nYou arrive at the airport and check in your bag. You wistfully watch as it travels down the conveyor belt and disappears behind a curtain of hanging rubber strips, wondering what happens next on its journey and if it will make it to your destination with you.\n\nIf you\u2019re traveling through Terminal B at LaGuardia Airport in New York, there\u2019s a very high likelihood that it will get where it\u2019s going \u2013 or get to you \u2013 just fine. The terminal, which fully opened to the public in 2022 after being totally reconstructed, was designed with a state-of-the-art handling system that, according to one official, can fully track about 98% of the bags that pass through from the moment they\u2019re checked to the moment they\u2019re loaded onto the plane.\n\nUSA TODAY had the opportunity to visit the restricted areas of the airport where bags are processed and learn all about how they move from curb to plane and gate to carousel.\n\nWhile our reporter and photographer didn\u2019t get to fulfill their dreams of riding the 3.2 miles of conveyor belts themselves, they were still afforded an up-close look at every stage of the bag-handling process.\n\nChecking in\n\n\u201cThe baggage journey starts on the departure level,\u201d Angelo Salgado, senior director of operations at LaGuardia Gateway Partners, told USA TODAY as he led the tour through the baggage claim system.\n\nOne thing that sets the system apart in Terminal B is floor-level baggage scales. It\u2019s a small detail, but representatives from LaGuardia Gateway Partners, which is the developer and manager of the new terminal, said the system was designed to make the passenger experience as smooth as possible. No need to pick up your overweight suitcase \u2013 you can just roll it into place before you pay your fee.\n\nThe terminal has seven induction piers for regular baggage, two oversized bag check areas, curbside check-in, and a group check-in facility. After being ingested into the system, bags move on to the primary screening facility, an area that\u2019s typically off-limits to the public.\n\nScreening\n\nThe seven check-in piers funnel bags to two central mainline conveyors, which bring the bags into the screening room. First, every bag is scanned by an array of 10 cameras as it comes in, which allows the system to read the bar code, ensure the luggage is being routed to the right flight, and detect its dimensions. Oversized bags that somehow didn\u2019t get sent to the large items belt at check-in will be flagged and rerouted automatically. Otherwise, they risk getting lodged in the machinery and backing up the screening of everything else.\n\nSalgado said that 96% of bags can be tracked once they\u2019re scanned, but that doesn\u2019t mean the other 4% are necessarily lost. He said most of the scanning failures have to do with \u201cbag hygiene\u201d \u2013 things like improperly affixed or poorly printed bag tags, or tags that are somehow obscured during the intake scan, which can affect the ability of the system to track them.\n\nIn the main screening room, every appropriately-sized bag passes through a CTX machine, which looks similar to the newest generation of scanners travelers may see at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints upstairs. Most bags are cleared through the machine for loading, and the system automatically moves them along if there\u2019s no problem.\n\nIf the machines detect something amiss, the bag triggers an alarm that alerts someone in the operation center. In many cases, they are able to inspect the bag remotely and clear it for loading just from an on-screen visual inspection, but if it needs a more thorough look, it gets routed to the secondary screening room instead.\n\nThe conveyor belts throughout the screening system only run as needed, unlike the older system with continuous-running belts. According to LaGuardia Gateway Partners, that results in a 37% energy savings compared to traditional systems.\n\nExtra screening\n\nBags that get flagged for additional screening get to ride on LIDAR-equipped robots known as mobile inspection tables. They\u2019re moved down a conveyor belt and automatically sent to an available TSA agent, who opens the bag and performs a more thorough inspection, then either clears it or pulls it aside as unsafe to travel.\n\nTerminal B has 55 battery-operated mobile inspection tables, and they can navigate without any tracks and shuffle themselves around to ensure they\u2019re all charged as needed.\n\nWhen a TSA agent clears the bag, they will put one of those \u201cyour bag has been inspected\u201d slips inside before sending it on its way.\n\nThe mobile inspection table then drops the bag back onto the belt so it can be loaded with the rest of the luggage.\n\nWithout the slips, most travelers would probably never know their bag had been pulled aside for extra screening, but Salgado said it\u2019s always a good idea to follow TSA packing guidelines as closely as possible for a smooth trip.\n\n\u201cAn alarmed bag has a higher chance of not making its flight,\u201d he said.\n\nLoading and unloading\n\nMost bags make it through the screening system in about 10-15 minutes if they don\u2019t need a second check or around 25 minutes if they do, Anthony Etergineoso, systems engineer for Oxford Airport Technical Services, the contractor that runs and maintains the system for LaGuardia Gateway Partners.\n\nAfter all the inspections are complete, bags head into a garage-like space where they\u2019re loaded onto the trucks that bring them out to departing planes.\n\nThe baggage system at Terminal B can handle more than 3,250 bags per hour or around 10,000-18,000 bags per day.\n\nSalgado said the machinery is highly efficient, and bags are most likely to have an issue during the loading or unloading process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the human component,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that manual interaction with the bag. Maybe they do a tight turn, the bag falls off the cart, and now it\u2019s potentially lost.\u201d\n\nAirlines or their contractors are in charge of their baggage loading operation, so this is where luggage also physically changes hands from the airport\u2019s systems back to the airline.\n\nBags are offloaded in the same room where they\u2019re put onto carts and then sent up to baggage claim.\n\nBaggage claim\n\nTerminal B has nine common-use baggage claims and two oversized belts, giving the operation an extra layer of flexibility.\n\nAccording to Salgado, the whole baggage system is tested at 3:15 a.m. every morning before check-in opens at 3:30, and the terminal operators developed contingency plans for how to keep luggage moving if something goes wrong.\n\nAside from baggage handlers, most of the luggage movement is automated, and only a handful of people \u2013 and one tank full of fish \u2013 are working behind the scenes when things are running smoothly.\n\nWhat behind-the-scenes aspect of travel would you like to know more about?\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

Consumers \u2013 many buckling under the weight of inflation that's sent rent and groceries prices higher the past three years \u2013 must figure out how to fit higher drug costs into their household budgets for the rest of the year.\n\nBut pharmaceutical companies seem to be limiting cost hikes as they navigate price guardrails under two new federal laws. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, drug companies must pay Medicare a rebate if they increase certain prices above the rate of inflation. The law also empowers Medicare to negotiate prices on a select number of drugs.\n\nAnother federal law, the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, might have a more immediate impact on prices. Drug companies this year could be forced to pay Medicaid rebates that in some cases exceed the amount they collect from the drug sales.\n\nOlder Americans who rely on these Medicare-negotiated drugs will soon get a financial break, a point Xavier Becerra, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, emphasized last week when he referred to the drug price negotiations as \"historic.\"\n\n\"Americans pay far too much for prescription drugs, many struggle to pay for their medication as a result,\" Becerra said. \"There are families throughout America who make real sacrifices to afford their medications.\"\n\nAbout 8 in 10 adults say the cost of prescription drugs is unreasonable, according to a July 2023 survey by KFF, a nonprofit focused on health policy. The survey found about 3 in 10 adults had trouble affording their medications.\n\nWhile this year's smaller median price increases might lessen some consumers' worries about affordability, the amount people pay will depend on their insurance coverage, drug coupons and complex rebates often hidden from public view.\n\nDrug pricing experts say the new federal laws are likely forcing drug companies to think twice before implementing large price hikes. Indeed, 46brooklyn analysis suggests drug companies are making smaller increases. Some have opted to slash prices rather than pay lucrative Medicaid rebates.\n\n\"The manufacturers have every reason to change the way they do business,\" said Antonio Ciaccia, president of 46brooklyn.\n\nWhich drug prices are increasing?\n\nPharma companies have announced price hikes of 10% or more on a dozen drugs and another two dozen-plus raised their prices by 9.9% in January.\n\nMany of these pricey new drugs are fairly obscure \u2013 they're certainly not household names.\n\nHill Dermaceuticals had the largest price hike, increasing the price for Tolak topical cream, used to treat skin lesions, by 33%. The Italian drugmaker Chiesi also hiked the price of Ferriprox \u2013 used to reduce iron in patients with sickle cell disease and anemia who get blood transfusions \u2013 by 21% for an oral solution and 13% for a tablet.\n\nA new class of weight loss drugs, known as GLP-1 receptors, will also see price hikes as demand from patients skyrockets.\n\nNovo Nordisk, which makes the diabetes drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus, increased the price of these medications by 3.5%. Eli Lilly's Mounjaro, also a GLP-1 weight loss drug used for diabetes, jumped 4.5%.\n\nDrugmakers hike prices on drugs slated for Medicare negotiation\n\nFor the first time, the federal government is allowed to negotiate drug prices for Medicare enrollees, the federal health program for older adults.\n\nBiden administration will bargain on prices for 10 widely-prescribed drugs to treat heart disease, diabetes and autoimmune conditions. On Thursday, HHS officials made initial offers to the makers of these 10 drugs, kicking off months of negotiations with drug companies. New prices for the 10 drugs will be made public by Sept. 1, and the negotiated prices will take effect in January 2026.\n\nOver the next two years, another 30 drugs will be selected for negotiated prices beginning in 2027 and 2028.\n\nAccording to the latest data, most of the drugs tapped by Medicare for negotiations, are squeezing in price hikes before negotiations begin. Pharma companies announced price increases for eight of the 10 drugs selected for Medicare negotiations. Those price hikes ranged from a 6% increase from Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer for the blood thinner Eliquis to a 3% bump for the diabetes medications Jardiance and Farxiga. Other drugs with modest increases include Januvia, Enbrel, Xarelto, Entresto and Stelara.\n\nThe list price for the blood cancer drug Imbruvica, sold by AbbVie Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, remained unchanged. Novo Nordisk slashed the price of its NovoLog insulin by 75%.\n\nWhile the initial negotiations will target just 10 drugs, Medicare's approach to rein in drug prices in 2026 and beyond \"will have ripple effects to other products\" that can last several years, said Megan West, a managing director of Avalere, a healthcare consulting and advisory firm.\n\nAnother major change: Drug companies may rethink how they price drugs from the moment they hit the market.\n\nInsulin makers slash prices\n\nEven though hundreds of drug prices are increasing, consumers who use insulin can expect to see price cuts from all three major insulin manufacturers.\n\nIn March, Sanofi became the last of three companies that account for 90% of the world's insulin business to announce price cuts. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly Co.'s plans had slashed U.S. prices by up to 75% and 70%, respectively.\n\nInsulin droppedDiabetes patients lament drugmaker's decision to discontinue Levemir insulin\n\nWhile manufacturers faced pressure from politicians and patient advocates to lower the price of insulin for years, some analysts say an arcane federal rule change for Medicaid rebates likely also motivated drugmakers to slash prices.\n\nFor years, drugmakers paid rebates to Medicaid and states, which then would reimburse drug companies for their medications dispensed to Medicaid enrollees.\n\nUntil this year, the rebate amounts had been capped under a federal formula. The American Rescue Plan Act eliminated that cap, which means drugmakers face potential penalties for raising drug prices over time, according to a KFF analysis.\n\nThe federal law change is an example of \"how many different pressure points are needed to address drug prices,\" said Leigh Purvis, a prescription drug policy principal at AARP\u2019s Public Policy Institute.\n\nPurvis said the major insulin makers likely cut prices, in part, to avoid paying lucrative penalties.\n\n\"There was definitely a financial incentive for them to kind of rein in those prices,\" Purvis said.\n\nAlso this month, GlaxoSmithKline discontinued the widely-prescribed asthma inhaler Flovent and replaced it with an authorized generic version \u2013 a decision that might have been to avoid steep Medicaid rebates, analysts said.\n\nIn another analysis, 46brooklyn examined average prices for the most commonly prescribed Medicaid drugs. Because insulins and other diabetes medications make up such a large share of Medicaid prescribing, the price cuts for those medications essentially meant Medicaid's average drug prices did not increase this year.\n\nHigher launch prices?\n\nWhile these programs are pressuring companies to take more modest price increases with existing drugs, the pressure might not apply to new drug launches. Ciaccia expects companies might choose to launch new drugs at even higher prices.\n\nBecause the federal laws require companies \"to adhere to a speed limit\" on price increases for existing drugs, \"some drug companies might choose to launch new drugs at even higher prices,\" he said.\n\n\"If they want to make more money, the only way that they can stay ahead of the system to take a more liberal approach to the launch price,\" Ciaccia said.\n\nKen Alltucker is on X, formerly Twitter, at @kalltucker, or can be emailed at alltuck@usatoday.com."}

James Comer, the Kentucky Republican who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, told Fox News host Sean Hannity that a witness in the investigation of President Joe Biden's family finances had somehow disproven Biden's claim that a \"wall\" existed between his government work and the business dealings of his son, Hunter.\n\nOne problem: That's not what the witness, Eric Schwerin, said in his testimony.\n\nSchwerin, in his opening statement, laid out his business history working with Hunter Biden and explained that he also did bookkeeping for Joe Biden when he was vice president, helping him prepare his taxes and financial disclosure statements.\n\nSchwerin said he saw no money in those books flowing to Joe Biden from his son or other family members.\n\n\"None,\" he added for emphasis, while under oath.\n\nRepublicans don't let the truth stand in the way of an investigation\n\nThat didn't stop Comer from declaring victory in the court of public opinion \u2013 The Hannity Show and other conservative platforms unlikely push back on the clear disparity between Comer's interpretation of the testimony and what the witness actually said.\n\n\"So when Joe Biden said there was a wall between the government and himself and his family's shady business schemes, that's not true because they all had the same bookkeeper,\" Comer said.\n\nHannity played along, of course, suggesting that Schwerin \"knew that a significant amount of money was being funneled to Joe Biden\" from his son's businesses.\n\nRemember, Schwerin said the opposite in his testimony.\n\nComer told Hannity Schwerin \"kept saying the same talking points that many of these associates use that Joe Biden wasn't involved\"\n\nReplay that: Comer openly admits there that many witnesses testified that Biden wasn't involved in his family's business dealings.\n\nDo politicians want to fix the border?Fixing the border crisis is bad for Trump and good for Biden. That's the problem.\n\nDid you know this goes back to Hillary Clinton?\n\nLike a lot of cop dramas on television, Comer's narrative twisting is a bit derivative.\n\nIt resembles \"CSI: Benghazi,\" the House select committee on a 2012 terrorist attack in that Libyan City that resulted in the deaths of four Americans. House Republicans wanted former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the spotlight for all that \u2013 coincidentally \u2013 just as she was clearly gearing up to run for president.\n\nKevin McCarthy, then a Republican congressman from California well-positioned to become the next speaker of the House, accidentally gave away the plot in an interview with Fox News in October 2015.\n\n'Bidenomics' is working:It's too bad for Biden that Trump's message of doom is winning.\n\n\u201cEverybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?\u201d McCarthy said then. \u201cBut we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping.\"\n\nHillary Clinton was beatable. McCarthy, who took some heat but eventually did become speaker, helped defeat Clinton with a damaging narrative, even if the story didn't check out.\n\nThe Biden inquiry is more of the same during an election year\n\nComer and some of his colleagues are now following that script, as Biden seeks another term. This unfolds as the likely Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, uses every campaign stop to allege financial impropriety between the president and his family.\n\nRob Walker, a business associate of Hunter Biden, told the Committee on Jan. 26 that Joe Biden was never involved in any of their business activities.\n\nComer quickly issued a statement claiming this about that testimony: \"Evidence continues to reveal the Bidens sold the \u2018Biden Brand\u2019 to enrich the Biden family.\"\n\nDevon Archer, another associate of Hunter Biden, told the committee last summer that Joe Biden never spoke about business when his son would call and put him on speaker phone.\n\nComer rushed onto Hannity's show that night to say Archer's testimony about Biden being on speakerphone made allegations that he took bribes passed along by his family \"more credible.\"\n\nBut the committee released the transcript of Archer's testimony, where he clearly disagrees with that claim.\n\nComer has pushed through fact-checks on documents too. In a Dec. 5 appearance on NBC News, Comer floated a bunch of theories about Biden as \"evidence\" but stumbled badly when asked about bank statements showing payments Hunter Biden made to his father on an interest-free loan.\n\n\"That's not true,\" Comer insisted while shaking his head no when NBC's Ryan Nobles said the House has bank records for the loan. NBC then showed the bank records on screen as Comer accused the network of using White House \"talking points.\"\n\nComer clearly hates it when journalists don't stick to his script.\n\nIt's clear that the accusation is the point. Not evidence.\n\nComer made the rounds in conservative outlets on Oct. 20, touting a check written to Joe Biden from his brother, James Biden, labeled \"loan repayment.\" Comer told Hannity that day he just didn't believe the loan ever happened, adding that the Republicans had just asked for documentation of the loan.\n\nSeems upside down, right? Make an accusation, then ask for evidence. It's almost as if \u2013 and hear me out here \u2013 the accusation is the whole point and the evidence, no matter what it shows, doesn't matter.\n\nCNN, in an Oct. 32 fact-check, reported that banking records already held by House Republicans showed \"substantial evidence\" that the loan between the president and his brother existed.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson:Evidence against Biden can't be ignored. We're pursuing impeachment inquiry.\n\nHunter Biden has lived a life both privileged and troubled, dealing with addiction and now federal criminal charges for taxes he did not pay on time, along with charges that he broke the law while buying a gun.\n\nDid he make a lot of money because his dad was a Senator who became vice president and then president? Sure seems that way. Is that proof that his father was on the take, accepting bribes from the people who paid his son?\n\nNo. That evidence has not been produced.\n\nThat's not saying it never will. But all the Fox News hits and committee statements can't change the fact that Comer's claims of \"evidence' are still just unsubstantiated allegations.\n\nShould the children of presidents and vice presidents be able to profit from their names and family connections? If you say no, do you apply that standard across all political parties?\n\nTrump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, reported earning between $172 million and $640 million while they were working in the White House, according to the Committee for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Nice side gig if you can land it.\n\nKushner was in Saudi Arabia during the final days of Trump's presidency, so he missed the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the capitol as rioters tried to stop the certification of Biden's 2020 win over his father-in-law.\n\nMust have been a great trip. The Saudi government's gargantuan wealth fund sunk $2 billion into Kushner's new private equity fund, not long after his father-in-law left office.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan"}

Now, scientists say that decrease in circumference is leading to shallow moonquakes \u2014 including near NASA\u2019s potential sites for human visits. Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter and get advice for life on our changing planet, in your inbox every Tuesday. ArrowRight \u201cA concept that I think that many people have is that the moon is this geologically dead body, that something on the moon never changes,\u201d said lunar geologist Tom Watters. But \u201cthe moon is a seismically active body.\u201d\n\nStudies of moonquakes date back to the Apollo era. More than 50 years ago, astronauts placed seismometers around the near side of the moon\u2019s surface to record trembles. The most powerful shallow quake was located near the south pole, which is near landing spots for NASA\u2019s Artemis III mission to send people back to the moon, potentially in 2027. The lunar south pole region is a enticing because it contains permanently shadowed regions that some speculate could have water-based ice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a new study, Watters and his colleagues state that this powerful quake is tied to a group of currently seismically active faults, which were created as the moon has shrunk. Quakes in the area could trigger landslides from loose rocks and dust from surrounding craters.\n\nOther researchers say we still don\u2019t have enough information to determine hazardous places to land on the moon.\n\nHow a shrinking moon could lead to quakes\n\nThe moon\u2019s shrinking has been measurable, but small. It has contracted about 150 feet in circumference over the last few hundred million years. Much of the shrinking is driven by natural cooling of our moon\u2019s molten core. As the core cools, the moon\u2019s surface contracts and adjusts to the change in volume. As it shrank, portions of the crust pushed together to form ridges known as thrust faults.\n\nEarth\u2019s gravitational pull on the moon also applies force to the lunar surface and adds stress, helping form these thrust faults on the moon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarth doesn\u2019t experience this same type of shrinking. Our molten core is also cooling, but Earth\u2019s crust is made of a jigsaw of tectonic plates, unlike the moon that has a single plate. Energy from Earth\u2019s core moves those plates or is released through volcanic eruptions, Watters said.\n\nThe shrinking of our moon has negligible effects for Earth. The change in size won\u2019t alter the occurrence of eclipses, for example. Its mass also isn\u2019t changing, so Earth\u2019s tides are not affected differently, either.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason Earthlings would need to be concerned with a shrinking moon \u2014 unless we move there.\n\n\u201cThe idea is not to discourage anyone from exploring the south pole of the moon,\u201d said Watters, a senior scientist emeritus in the National Air and Space Museum\u2019s Center for Earth and Planetary Studies. \u201cBut just to make sure that it\u2019s understood that it\u2019s not a benign environment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike on Earth, these faults are often associated with seismic activity. The thrust faults can appear like a wall tens of meters high \u2014 detectable but certainly no mountain. Thousands of small thrust faults have now been discovered across the moon, thanks to high-resolution imagery from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The fact they remain on the surface, instead of the being eroded to nonexistence, means they must be young and probably active, Watters said.\n\nWhen they located the thrust faults in images, team members reanalyzed data from the Apollo seismometers. Using an algorithm, they were able to narrow down the thrust faults that were likely triggered the moonquakes. They found the largest earthquake \u2014 a magnitude of 5 on the Richter scale near the south pole \u2014 was linked with a cluster of likely still active faults.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to believe that they\u2019re not currently active because we know the moon is still hot and its interior is still cooling off,\u201d Watters said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo determine potential damage, the team modeled surface slopes in the south polar region to see if any areas were more susceptible to landslides from seismic shaking. It found some slopes in permanently shadowed areas, like the Shackleton Crater that is one of the potential landing sites for the NASA\u2019s Artemis III mission, was very prone to seismic activity. Even a light amount of shaking triggered landslides along its steep walls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a huge mass of material, but it\u2019s still significant enough that you wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere near it,\u201d Watters said.\n\nMoonquakes are different from earthquakes in a few key ways. They can last much longer on the moon, sometimes for hours. Because of the moon\u2019s weaker gravity, a quake will also feel much stronger than on Earth. Even a moderate amount of shaking could take you off your feet, Watters said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study brings \u201cmore evidence that there are moonquakes and some of them may be relatively large,\u201d said geophysicist Allen Husker, who was not involved in the research. The combination of the moon\u2019s shrinking and pull from Earth \u201ccombine to make these moonquakes larger than we would have guessed beforehand.\u201d\n\nHow the quakes could affect future human visits\n\nEven if the quakes are big, they don\u2019t occur too often. Husker\u2019s research estimated that shallow moonquakes occur about once every 100 days on average across the entire lunar surface. It would be very serendipitous if a quake hit right where the astronauts land for a few days.\n\nThe hazard, he said, would be important to protect against if and when people build an outpost for visiting or even living on the moon \u2014 much like a strengthening a building in earthquake-prone areas in California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFuture moon bases should be installed far from seismic sources to avoid damage or built to withstand seismic shaking,\u201d said Husker, also a researcher professor at California Institute of Technology. \u201cIf we can map those as we have done on the Earth, then we can avoid them.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is convinced of this potential hazard, though. One separate study published in 2022 concluded that shallow moonquakes from these thrust faults would be weaker than what this new research describes. It also wouldn\u2019t affect many areas on the moon, including the majority of Artemis III landing site candidates.\n\nSenthil Kumar, an author of the 2022 study, said his \u201cstand remains the same\u201d despite the new research. In fact, the new study presents \u201cone of the rarest possibilities.\"\n\n\u201cIt is too early to argue for such hazard scenarios to Artemis sites, [which] might devastate the lunar base,\u201d said Kumar, a researcher at the National Geophysical Research Institute in Hyderabad, India.\n\nTo make an accurate hazard assessment, he said the scientific community needs a better understanding of the local site conditions, properties of potential moonquake sources and the conditions that would propagate the seismic ground motion."}

After months of shying away from attacking four-times-indicted Donald Trump, she has let loose a gusher of attacks on the former president\u2019s declining mental state. Her barbs have been so devastating that some are featured in one of President Biden\u2019s ads (on Truth Social, no less):\n\nMSNBC airs our new ad on Truth Social: Oh wow. What is Trump saying? He\u2019s babbling pic.twitter.com/OFROyxnLh9 \u2014 Biden-Harris HQ (@BidenHQ) February 1, 2024\n\nBut the question remains: Does Haley really believe Trump is cognitively unfit or is this simply another wrinkle in an infamously opportunistic candidate\u2019s campaign?\n\nTo answer that, we should take a step back to determine the rationale for keeping up her campaign. At this point, trailing by more than 25 points or so in South Carolina, her home state, her chances of winning are slim to none. (Perhaps she is intent on simply accumulating delegates so that if Trump gets convicted and the party panics \u2014 the former likely, the latter unlikely \u2014 before the convention, she would be in a position to launch a fight on the convention floor.) Having taken on Trump so vociferously over the last few weeks, she surely will not be his pick for vice president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reason for her continued run, then, centers on either her attempt to stake out post-2024 ground as the leader of the anti-Trump forces or perhaps even to stage an independent run later this year. (The notion that she is doing this for the good of the country assumes, unrealistically, that she has the patriotism and moral fiber of a Liz Cheney.)\n\nFollow this author Jennifer Rubin 's opinions Follow\n\nWhatever the reason for her persistence, Haley has staked her message and identity on making Trump unacceptable, even to Republican voters. That leaves her with three tasks over the remainder of her campaign.\n\nFirst, she must qualify her previous statements that she would endorse Trump if she dropped out. During a recent interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Haley was asked how she could still endorse Trump given the E. Jean Carroll verdicts, the criminal cases and his demand for absolute immunity. She explained she would not want \u201cto see a President Kamala Harris,\u201d seemingly suggesting that Biden wouldn\u2019t survive a second term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s time to \u201cclarify\u201d that, though she wouldn\u2019t support Biden and Harris after Trump\u2019s recent conduct, the former president\u2019s observed mental decline and courtroom behavior now mean Haley might withhold her endorsement of Trump, as former New Jersey governor Chris Christie has done. She might say something along the lines: \u201cWell, his behavior has given me real concerns. I would have to evaluate his fitness if and when I drop out.\u201d\n\nWould this look like a flip-flop? Certainly, but the alternative is to make her own claim that Trump is unfit look empty (or alternatively, make her appear cavalier about the country\u2019s well-being). If she wants to maintain the rationale for her run and keep her options open, she cannot let on that he is still mentally stable enough to earn her endorsement.\n\nSecond, she needs to come clean on what she observed while working in Trump\u2019s administration. A smattering of former advisers \u2014 including John Bolton, John F. Kelly, William P. Barr \u2014 and the slew of former aides who testified in front of the Jan. 6 House select committee have cited chapter and verse of his inability to process information, to put country over himself and to control his emotions. (That some of these people would nevertheless endorse him speaks to their own moral deficiency and tribalism.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, Haley certainly observed him up close. Describing what evidence of his unfitness she witnessed, and what sentiments he expressed about our enemies \u2014 especially Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 would seem essential not only to making her case against him but also in explaining how she, despite her boss, defended national security. It is remarkable no interviewer has pressed her on the issue.\n\nLastly, Haley would do well to make clear \u2014 as Christie has \u2014 that the risk of Trump\u2019s conviction in one or all cases is real.

In Montgomery County, Md., a petition supporting the investigation of teachers for sharing pro-Palestinian images and messages garnered 3,500 signatures.\n\nAnd in California, at least 30 Jewish families have requested transfer out of the Oakland Unified School District because of issues related to the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nCharges of antisemitism that have coursed through college campuses since the Oct. 7 attack in Israel by Hamas are also embroiling some K-12 school districts, as the emotional toll and anger surrounding the resulting war continues to tear at communities. It was unclear how many of these cases have surfaced, but school districts across the country have grappled with how much to allow students and staff to say about the conflict, and what to do when that speech offends or even makes others feel unsafe. The U.S. Department of Education has opened 19 investigations of potential federal civil rights violations into K-12 school systems alleging antisemitism, Islamophobia or other bias related to the conflict.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur concern is not so much about Israel and Gaza but about the one-sided viewpoints being pushed into the classrooms and teachers crossing the line when they go beyond teaching the facts,\u201d said Simon Ferber, who is pulling his 6-year-old son out of the Oakland schools at year\u2019s end. He and his wife complain that teachers have emphasized the harm to Palestinians but not harm to Israelis. They plan to move their family to Los Angeles, where they believe the climate for Jews will be more welcoming.\n\nA spokesman for the Oakland school district declined to comment about families leaving the district, but the district superintendent has spoken out against teachers using unauthorized, pro-Palestinian material in their classrooms.\n\nCharges of bias have also come from the opposite direction, with some alleging that schools are not allowing free expression of pro-Palestinian views.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Montgomery County, Md., for instance, a middle school teacher was put on leave in November after she included the phrase \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\u201d in her school email signature, one of several teachers to face consequences for expressing pro-Palestinian views. Some interpret \u201cFrom the river to the sea\u201d as a call for eliminating the Jewish state.The teacher has said she was attempting to show support for Palestinians\u2019 \u201cpeace and for their freedom.\"\n\nBut as the war presses on, some Jewish families say they\u2019re still seeing too much antisemitism language and images.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been complete neglect of this issue,\u201d said Gerard Filitti, senior counsel at the Lawfare Project, a pro bono law firm that represents Jews in cases where antisemitism is alleged and who helped organize the rally this week in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s a parallel to college campuses. But here we are talking about more susceptible younger children [who are] more easily affected.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York rally was intended to ask school officials to do more to prevent and respond to incidents such as a November protest in which hundreds of students criticized a Jewish teacher who had posted a photo of herself holding an \u201cI Stand With Israel\u201d sign.\n\n\u201cWe Jews are not okay,\u201d said Michelle Ahdoot, director of planning and strategy at #EndJewHatred, which co-sponsored the rally, recounting recent classroom incidents as many in the crowd held Israeli flags aloft.\n\nLast week, New York Schools Chancellor David Banks announced a plan to combat antisemitism, Islamophobia and \u201call forms of hate,\u201d including new education and training for staff and clear instructions on how to report incidents. \u201cLet me be clear: We have zero tolerance for any form of bigotry or hate,\u201d Banks said.\n\nBut rally organizers said that was not enough and demanded, among other things, that the schools define antisemitism to include anti-Zionism. While some argue these things are inextricably linked, others say that opposition to Israel as a Jewish state is not the same as hatred of Jews.\n\nThe Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, which works to combat antisemitism, has been tracking incidents across the country. It is focusing on California, where it believes some schools deliver anti-Israel messages through a state-mandated ethnic studies course, said L. Rachel Lerman, vice chair and general counsel for the group. For instance, the group alleges that lessons present a history of the conflict in a biased way that puts too much of the blame on Israel for harm to the Palestinians and does not hold the Palestinians accountable for their actions. The California Legislative Jewish Caucus voiced similar concerns about some ethnic studies curriculums in a January letter to colleagues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLerman said she is now preparing possible litigation to address what she considers antisemitic activity in the schools. The activity, she said, amounts to a \u201chostile environment\u201d and is barred by federal civil rights law.\n\nThe California Department of Education did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nIn general, U.S. public schools have operated under the premise that they need to be nonpartisan, but in recent years, educators, school boards and administrators alike have all begun to weigh in on controversial political issues, said John Rogers, an education professor at UCLA who studies education and democracy.\n\nMany teachers, he said, see a moral urgency to call out injustice when they detect it.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cI do think that many educators have followed the news in Israel and Gaza and have been heartbroken at the dynamics that have been playing out and have wanted to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cSome educators have felt compelled to act politically on behalf of the issue. That\u2019s not entirely surprising.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Oakland, a district of about 34,000 students east of San Francisco, controversy was sparked in October, when the Oakland Education Association, which represents the district\u2019s teachers, posted on social media a statement condemning \u201cthe genocidal and apartheid state of Israel.\u201d\n\nThe union apparently deleted the post following criticism online that it was one-sided and, in the words of one Jewish parent writing on X, \u201cblatant antisemitism.\u201d In a new post on Facebook, the union said that it \u201cunequivocally condemns anti-Semitism and Islamophobia,\u201d but it also shared the text of a resolution that some Jewish parents found nearly as offensive.\n\nThe resolution condemned Israel\u2019s \u201c75 year long illegal military occupation of Palestine,\u201d and repeating that Israel was \u201can apartheid state\u201d whose leaders \u201chave espoused genocidal rhetoric.\u201d\n\nA faction of the union encouraged members to teach this point of view in the classroom, providing materials for a pro-Palestinian \u201cteach-in\u201d in December, which was unauthorized by the district. Material included, for instance, an alphabet book for elementary students called \u201cP is for Palestine,\u201d that includes, \u201cI is for Intifada, Intifada is Arabic for rising up for what is right, if you are a kid or a grown-up!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn elementary school teacher who helped organize the teach-in said the plan grew from activists asking themselves, \u201cWhat is our power as workers?\u201d She said the answer was \u201cusing our collective strength to bring these issues to our students.\u201d The teacher argued that it was justified to teach unsanctioned material because the material given to them did not include enough of the Palestinian perspective.\n\nShe estimated that 70 to 100 teachers participated (out of about 2,300), although secretly because they feared disciplinary action if caught. She said no one had been disciplined. She spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of facing discipline from the district.\n\nNot all teachers unions have taken the same tack. An October statement by Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, which Oakland\u2019s union is part of, was more evenhanded in condemning events in Israel and Gaza and spoke of a \u201cdangerous rise in anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim bigotry and violence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials from the Oakland Education Association did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nOakland Superintendent Kyla Johnson-Trammell voiced her concerns about the union\u2019s actions in an open letter to the community. \u201cOur schools are sanctuaries for learning, and I am deeply disappointed by the harmful and divisive materials being circulated and promoted as factual,\u201d she said. She said the district has \u201cremained unwavering in our stance against antisemitic, anti-Israeli, Islamophobic, or anti-Palestinian prejudice or discrimination,\u201d and added: \u201cWe are aware of some recent incidents that may have cast doubt on the District\u2019s commitment to this fundamental expectation.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the debate has been deeply unsettling to some Jewish parents in Oakland. Shira Avoth said the walls of her seventh-grade son\u2019s English classroom were papered with posters calling Israel\u2019s actions genocide and generally \u201cvilifying\u201d its conduct in the war. One poster, she said, called for Palestinian freedom \u201cfrom the river to the sea.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Avoth complained, her son was removed from the class. \u201cHe didn\u2019t feel safe there,\u201d she said. He then \u201csat in limbo or in the office\u201d during class time. Subsequently, she said, the teacher was removed but Avoth does not know whether he will be allowed to return.\n\nAvoth plans to request a transfer to another district for next school year but has not yet decided if she will use it. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to allow curriculum that is attempting to indoctrinate children and vilify my son\u2019s heritage, we\u2019re going to leave,\u201d she said.\n\nShe is part of a large group of Jewish parents who have gathered in a WhatsApp text group where members offer affirmation to one another and trade stories of classroom incidents. She described finding the group, a few weeks after the Oct. 7 massacre, as \u201cindescribable relief.\u201d\n\nFor Simon Ferber, the father preparing to leave Oakland for Los Angeles, it has all been deeply unsettling. He grew up near Oakland and was excited about settling down there, where he was confident his liberal values of inclusion, diversity and belonging would be embraced. But he felt that Jews don\u2019t receive the same support as other minorities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s felt isolating and as if the support we thought we would have \u2014 or expected \u2014 has dropped out from under us,\u201d Ferber said.\n\nIn a neighboring district, Berkeley Unified, there are similar complaints, although no sign of mass departure from the schools.\n\nIlana Pearlman, who has children in the first and ninth grades in Berkeley, said anti-Israel posters with a photo of a little girl\u2019s bloody face were affixed to utility poles surrounding her daughter\u2019s elementary school but administrators did not seem to take her concerns about this seriously. At the high school, she said, a walkout and rally in support of the Palestinians was promoted by her son\u2019s art teacher.\n\nIn class, she said, the art teacher repeatedly showed what she believes to be \u201cantisemitic images,\u201d such as a drawing of a fist punching through a Jewish Star of David and the word \u201cPalestine\u201d in large letters.\n\n\u201cMy son felt uncomfortable,\u201d Pearlman said. She said five Jewish students including her son left the class but the teacher was allowed to continue teaching. \u201cAll of our complaints go into a giant black hole,\u201d she said.\n\nShe complained that the school culture allows for scant nuance in difficult situations like this war, where violence has been inflicted on both sides and where the events were preceded by a long history with pain on all sides. \u201cIn Berkeley, you can only be an oppressor or the oppressed,\u201d she said.\n\nThe art teacher declined to comment."}

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Following her Feb. 4, 1974, kidnapping by the tiny, disorganized Symbionese Liberation Army, Hearst began to lose faith in her wealthy family\u2019s ability to meet the SLA\u2019s initial $4 million ransom demand ($25 million today), which continued to escalate. On April 3, she released a tape as \u201cTania,\u201d the 11th member of the SLA.\n\nA photo of Hearst in revolutionary garb, toting a machine gun, instantly made her a front-page celebrity. On April 15, security footage showed her robbing a San Francisco bank owned by a childhood friend\u2019s dad. The following month, she was back in the headlines after firing more than two dozen rounds to rescue her kidnapper Bill Harris as he was being tackled by Inglewood security guards at Mel\u2019s Sporting Goods. Hours later, she joined Harris and his wife, Emily, in the kidnapping of suburban Los Angeles high school student Tom Matthews because they needed his family van as a getaway vehicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer face was on post-office \u201cwanted\u201d posters nationwide as the FBI\u2019s vast Operation Hernap task force chased her across the country for the next 16 months. She was finally arrested back home in San Francisco in September 1975, not long after her involvement in two Sacramento-area bank holdups, including one that left a customer dead.\n\nHer defense lawyer said she\u2019d been brainwashed. Hearst said she\u2019d been raped by several of her kidnappers and forced to rob banks and read taped communiqu\u00e9s that attacked her family and fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe prosecutors insisted, citing her own words, that she had joined the rebellion and voluntarily turned on her parents and the Hearst empire.\n\nThe prosecutors\u2019 argument won over the jury, and she was sentenced to seven years in prison.\n\nSo who was Patty Hearst? A multitude of labels have been applied to her: clueless wealthy heiress, rebel, young bride-to-be, kidnapping victim, rape victim, terrorist, fugitive, Stockholm syndrome archetype, criminal, recipient of a presidential pardon. But what was her true nature?\n\nFifty years later, the answer remains unclear. But my extensive personal interactions with two of the people closest to Hearst during her turbulent youth can help shed some light on one of the most mysterious figures in American history.\n\n\u201cWhere would I go?\u201d\n\nMy education on the Patty Hearst saga began in earnest when I wrote a book with her fianc\u00e9 Steve Weed, who lived in my Berkeley home for months after he was beaten during her kidnapping.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeed began a relationship with Hearst when she was 16 and he was her 23-year-old high school math teacher. While one of Weed\u2019s fellow teachers knew she was secretly spending nights at his place, her parents were oblivious to their secret romance. At first, the perks of the relationship for Hearst included copies of a final exam Steve took from her geometry teacher\u2019s files.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, in December 1973, they announced they were getting married. After reading about their summer wedding plans in the San Francisco papers, the SLA comrades decided she was the ideal target. Two months later, they kidnapped her from the Berkeley duplex she shared with Weed.\n\nAfter he recovered from his beating by SLA members during the kidnapping, Weed moved in with Hearst\u2019s parents, but they found him a challenging houseguest, and he left after a few weeks. Around this time, I interviewed him for New Times magazine. When an editor asked if I\u2019d co-write his memoir, he moved into my Berkeley home for four months while we worked on the book, which was never published.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid Patty\u2019s memorabilia, valuables and Hearst estate rugs he brought to my house for safekeeping was the statement for her trust fund worth $70,000 (more than half a million today) when she turned 21.\n\nWeed told me Hearst resented the way her parents dominated her life, saying, only half in jest, that she wished \u201cthey\u2019d die in a plane crash.\u201d\n\nHe insisted nothing in Hearst\u2019s past explained her decision to join the SLA. Once when they were together, she brazenly stormed through a United Farm Workers picket line at a Safeway supermarket, calling the protesters \u201cmiserable \u2026 migrant people\u201d and a series of expletives.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAt the time, Weed said, she had little interest in the women\u2019s movement, and she regarded her father\u2019s concern and support for impoverished Latinos living in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District with a mixture of distrust, amusement and disdain.\n\nAfter her \u201creeducation\u201d in captivity, she attacked Weed in SLA communiqu\u00e9s published in her father\u2019s San Francisco Examiner. In one, she professed her agreement with the SLA women who \u201cinsisted that the trouble with Steve and with all bourgeois men was that \u2026 they could not abide the thought that women could think and choose for themselves.\u201d She would never see or talk to Weed again.\n\nThat decision may have been related to Patty\u2019s communiqu\u00e9 declaring her love for one of the SLA kidnappers, William Wolfe. Their love story was cut short on May 17, 1974, when Wolfe and five other SLA members were shot to death and partially incinerated by the Los Angeles Police Department. This 9,000-round shootout would go down as the biggest domestic firefight in U.S. history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHearst eulogized Wolfe in a taped communiqu\u00e9 as \u201cthe gentlest, most beautiful man I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d\n\nThe deadly firefight convinced her that surrendering to the police could get her killed.\n\n\u201cThe pig lies about the advisability of surrender,\u201d she explained in another taped communiqu\u00e9, \u201chave only made me more determined.\u201d Besides, as she said later, \u201cWhere would I go?\u201d\n\nAccording to the SLA\u2019s Harris, Patty\u2019s captors repeatedly told her she was free to return home to her fianc\u00e9, to live out the American Dream with two kids, a collie and a station wagon.\n\nThat return wouldn\u2019t come until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter commuted her sentence after 22 months served. Thanks to a vigorous Hearst lobbying campaign, Bill Clinton, in his last official act as president, granted her a full pardon in 2001.\n\nShe married her bodyguard, former San Francisco cop Bernard Shaw, who was later appointed head of Hearst corporate security. Hearst became a mother, grandmother, philanthropist, actress, novelist and kennel club competition winner. Today, she is 69. She couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\n\u201cPatty Hearst was ideal\u201d\n\nHearst\u2019s surviving kidnappers Bill and Emily Harris went to prison in 1977. In 1988, five years after they were paroled, Bill Harris granted me his first lengthy interview, for a series in the Oakland Tribune. The SLA, he said, mistakenly assumed Hearst would be an easy $4 million ransom hit that could jump-start their revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPatty Hearst was ideal: an heiress, and a perfect symbol of the control of the media and the ruling class,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat plutocrat wouldn\u2019t want to quickly ransom their daughter from a gang of revolutionaries on the eve of her society wedding?\u201d\n\nHarris got in touch again last month when he learned of my new novel, \u201cSearching for Patty Hearst,\u201d a fictionalized account of the kidnapping. A half-century after the kidnapping, he shared his perspective on what had happened to Hearst.\n\nHer father, Randolph Apperson Hearst, who taught her to shoot a gun when she was 9, \u201ctreated her like the son he never had,\u201d Harris said in an email. \u201cWhen Randy claimed to be too poor to engage in negotiations with the SLA, it shocked the hell out of her, hurt her, but she seemed to get over it fairly rapidly as she began to consider what repatriation really meant. Go Home!? Seriously?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked if he thought Patty was brainwashed or a true revolutionary during her SLA days. He said:\n\nPlease imagine this. Patricia Hearst\u2019s various transitions, without complex contexts, are sometimes incomprehensible but often predictable. Make no mistake, she was NEVER a revolutionary. She rejected the excesses of her class and she was compelled to rebel against the institutions she\u2019d identified as oppressive, because of the kidnapping. She first learned from us that, amongst us, only she had the privilege of a defense, assuming she survived any attempts to apprehend her. We had no problem with her defense as long as she and her lawyers kept it legit. Her public & recorded demeanor after her apprehension put serious pressure on her attorneys to figure out how to monsterize us & embellish the narrative claiming torture, rape & brainwashing. Not very comradely. Still, I absolutely feel no animus toward Hearst. She saved my bacon on the Imperial Highway in Inglewood as I was being arrested for shoplifting.\n\nThat version of Patty Hearst \u2014 the one who came in firing to free her kidnapper from arrest \u2014 is hard to square with the one Hearst later described in a tell-all book. She wrote that after her brutal kidnapping, the only way to survive was to follow orders, rob banks, kidnap a teenager and issue communiqu\u00e9s crafted by her captors.\n\nWhen Paul Schrader turned her book into a 1988 film starring Natasha Richardson as Hearst, he added a fictionalized encounter between Hearst and her father at the end. In a review of the movie in the New Yorker, Pauline Kael wrote, \u201cDid Patty Hearst become part of the S.L.A. willingly, or was she simply trying to save her life? The movie shows you that, in the state she was in, there was no difference.\"\n\nWe can only conclude that all these conflicting accounts will never truly be resolved. Fifty years later, the events that followed Hearst\u2019s kidnapping remain \u2014 and will remain \u2014 an unsolvable mystery."}

Live well every day with tips and guidance on food, fitness and mental health, delivered to your inbox every Thursday. ArrowRight As a small animal primary care veterinarian, I deal with the diseases of dog and cat waste on a daily basis. Feces represent potential zoonotic hazards, meaning they can transmit disease from animals to humans.\n\nWhile human diseases caused by soil-transmitted parasites are considered uncommon in America, they infect as many as an estimated 1 billion people worldwide. Signs that remind you to pick up after your pet are not just trying to keep public spaces clean; they\u2019re urging you to help safeguard your community\u2019s health.\n\nAbandoned poop\u2019s impact on people\n\nCommon dog waste parasites include hookworms, roundworms, coccidia and whipworms. Hookworms and roundworms can thrive in a variety of species, including humans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir microscopic larvae can enter the human body through small scratches in the skin after contact with contaminated soil or via accidental oral ingestion. Remember that next time you\u2019re outside and wipe sweat from your face with a dirty hand and then lick your lips or take a drink \u2014 it\u2019s that simple. After hose or rain water has rinsed contaminated poop into the soil, these parasite eggs can survive and infect for months to years to come.\n\nOnce in the human body, both hookworm and roundworm larvae can mature and migrate through the bloodstream into the lungs. From there, coughs help them gain access to the digestive tract, where they leach nutrients by attaching to the intestinal wall. People with healthy immune systems may show no clinical signs of infection, but in sufficient quantities the parasites can lead to anemia and malnourishment. They can even cause an intestinal obstruction which may require surgical intervention, especially in young children.\n\nThe impact on other animals\n\nDogs and cats can also develop the same symptoms people do from parasitic infections. In addition to risks of hookworms and roundworms, pets also are vulnerable to whipworm, giardia and coccidia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond parasites, unattended poop may also be contaminated with canine or feline viruses, such as parvovirus, distemper virus and canine coronavirus, that can create life-threatening disease in other dogs and cats (the canine strain does not infect humans), especially in adult animals that are unvaccinated and puppies and kittens.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThese viruses attack rapidly dividing cells, in particular the intestinal lining and bone marrow, leaving them unable to absorb nutrients appropriately and unable to produce replacement red and white blood cells that help defend against these and other viruses. Vaccination can protect pets.\n\nMany species of local wildlife are within the canid and felid family groups. They, too, are susceptible to many of the same parasites and viruses as pet dogs and cats \u2014 while being much less likely to have received the benefit of vaccinations. Coyotes, wolves, foxes, raccoons, minks and bobcats are at risk of contracting parvovirus, coronavirus and distemper.\n\nResponsible pet poop management\n\nSo, wherever your dog or cat relieves himself \u2014 at the park, in the woods, on the sidewalk or even in your yard \u2014 pick up that poop, but always avoid contact with your skin. It\u2019s safest to use a shovel to place the poop directly into a plastic bag, or put a baggie over your hand to grab the poop and then pull the plastic bag over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTie up the bag and make sure to place it in a trash can \u2014 not on top \u2014 to avoid inadvertent contamination of a neighbor or sanitation worker. Promptly wash your hands, particularly before touching your face or eating or drinking. Hand sanitizers can take care of many viruses on your skin, but they won\u2019t kill parasite eggs.\n\nOther potential sources of poop \u2014 and parasite \u2014 exposure are the sandbox, beaches and park sand found under and around playgrounds. Sand is comfortable to lounge on, fun to construct into castles and softens the impact if you fall off a play structure. But cats and other small mammals love to use it as a litter box. Covering sandboxes when not in use and closely monitoring your environment at the beach and playground are key steps toward minimizing risks.\n\nBy keeping your pets on regular parasite prevention protocols, with annual testing for intestinal parasites, and routine removal of fecal material from the environment, you can also help to minimize the potential for these diseases among all the mammals in your environment \u2014 human, pet and wild.\n\nKey points to remember to avoid parasites and minimize the impact on your ecosystem:\n\nPick it up and safely throw out waste regardless of where your pet poops. Sanitize your hands afterward.\n\nWash your hands before eating or touching your face while gardening or working in the yard.\n\nAvoid rinsing poop into the soil. Using rain or a garden hose removes only the visible mess, not the microscopic issues.\n\nMake sure sandboxes are covered when not in use.\n\nKeep your pets on monthly intestinal parasite deworming schedules.\n\nHave your vet test your pet\u2019s poop annually for intestinal parasites.\n\nThe writer is a clinical assistant professor of small animal clinical sciences at the University of Florida."}

Keeping him on the ballot so voters could decide was the path to long-term institutional stability and might finally force a reckoning in the Republican Party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany people I respect continue to hold versions of this view. But the more I read and listened, the clearer it became that Section 3 was directed against precisely the conduct Trump engaged in. Its purpose is to protect the republic from those who would shred the Constitution and destroy our system of self-government. What Trump did in advance of the attack on the Capitol and on Jan. 6, 2021, legally disqualifies him from the presidency.\n\nFollow this author E.J. Dionne Jr. 's opinions Follow\n\nThe record is clear that the legislators who wrote and enacted the amendment in the wake of the Civil War were not just thinking of the Confederacy\u2019s leaders but also of \u201cthe leaders of any rebellion hereafter to come.\u201d\n\nThose are the words of John B. Henderson, a Republican senator from Missouri, when he cast his vote for the amendment in 1866. They are recorded in a powerful amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court by a distinguished group of historians of the era: David Blight, Drew Gilpin Faust, Jill Lepore and John Fabian Witt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe amendment\u2019s authors, they argue, \u201choped not only to prevent a resurgence of secessionism but also to protect future generations against insurrectionism.\u201d It was intended \u201cto bar anyone who has betrayed an oath to uphold the Constitution from becoming President of the United States.\u201d\n\nThey back up these assertions with a compelling 34-page account of what the framers of the amendment intended and why they wrote it as they did. The essay should encourage conservatives on the Supreme Court, which hears the case on Thursday, to ponder words they love, \u201coriginalism\u201d and \u201ctextualism.\u201d\n\nOther historically minded briefs made it harder for me to stick with my earlier, prudent view. A group of 25 historians, including James McPherson, the Civil War\u2019s premier chronicler, and Nell Irvin Painter, a specialist in Black and Southern history, cite the congressional debate on Section 3 to show that it plainly applies to the office of the president. They offer clear evidence that implementing the section \u201cdid not require additional acts of Congress,\u201d as some defenders of Trump claim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, a Howard Law School professor and former president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, shows how the clause to disqualify insurrectionists is closely linked to the 14th Amendment\u2019s core purpose, \u201ca bold and expansive promise of citizenship for Black people.\u201d Its framers were preoccupied with the \u201congoing resistance to full Black citizenship by southern states\u201d and feared that \u201cBlack men who had been loyal to the Union \u2026 would be disenfranchised, while disloyal white former Confederates would be rewarded with the vote.\u201d\n\nTrump is a present-day embodiment of their fears, she wrote, having offered \u201ca false narrative discrediting the votes cast in jurisdictions with high concentrations of Black voters,\u201d including Detroit, Philadelphia and Atlanta.\n\nAnd to argue that barring Trump from the ballot is \u201cantidemocratic,\u201d wrote professors Carol Anderson and Ian Farrell in another brief, is \u201cironic \u2026 as he bears by far the most responsibility for attempting to subvert democracy on Jan. 6.\u201d An effort to overthrow constitutional procedures, wrote Ifill, should be distinguished from political protests, even those \u201caccompanied by sporadic acts of violence.\u201d Demonstrators are not the same as a mob trying to hijack the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are paradoxes galore on this matter. Believing Trump should be unable to run, for example, is the opposite of a partisan wish, since he is without question the weakest Republican whom President Biden could face. Another: Even if Colorado was right to block Trump from the ballot, it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do so on states\u2019 rights grounds alone. This is a national question, and the court should not duck the fundamental issues at stake \u2014 though my hunch is that the court might look for a way to punt."}

Michael Sandel, a well-known professor of political philosophy, stepped lightly across the stage and encouraged students to disagree.\n\nHands shot up. The goal is not consensus, Sandel said later \u2014 and the lessons are particularly important now. \u201cWe\u2019re steeped in toxic public discourse. So it\u2019s especially important for colleges and universities to provide a civic education in listening, reasoning and arguing about big questions that matter.\u201d\n\nStudents returned to Harvard\u2019s campus last month after a turbulent and polarized start to the academic year, one punctuated by protests, a disastrous congressional hearing and the resignation of the university\u2019s first Black president. The school has been sharply divided over the Israel-Gaza war; diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; and the limits of free expression. It has been attacked by politicians, wealthy alumni and its own students, a rare sign of vulnerability for one of the country\u2019s most powerful and influential academic institutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year, Harvard must navigate political animosity that has made higher education an attractive target, an investigation by Congress, pointed criticism of its leadership and a lawsuit by students accusing the school of rampant antisemitism.\n\nLast week, more than a dozen students, represented by the Muslim Legal Fund of America, asked the Education Department to investigate what they said was the school\u2019s failure to protect Muslim, Arab and Palestinian students from harassment, intimidation and assault.\n\nAnd one of Harvard\u2019s most generous donors, billionaire alumnus Ken Griffin, announced during an interview at a conference with CNBC\u2019s Leslie Picker a pause in donations \u201cuntil Harvard makes it very clear that they\u2019re going to resume their role as educating young American men and women to be leaders, to be problem solvers, to take on difficult issues.\u201d\n\nAs the year begins, a question that looms is whether the school can draw on its own ideals and the collective wisdom of its people to emerge from this test stronger, or whether it \u2014 and the country \u2014 is too divided.\n\nStudents crisscrossed Harvard Yard last month, hoods up as a cold rain fell on a campus that was outwardly calm and quiet. For some, the tensions of recent weeks and months are very raw: Some students lost family members in the war, saw friends go to fight, watched death tolls rise. Some were frightened by what they viewed as outright hostility on campus. Some risked sanctions to speak out about their convictions.\n\nBut many, less directly connected to the conflict, are focused on classes and labs and college life, eager for the controversies to end. Some were troubled by the resignation of Claudine Gay as president amid criticism of her responses to questions about antisemitism on campus and plagiarism allegations. Some have seen their own thinking about the issues evolve over time, and described reactions on campus as far more complex, and nuanced, than they may seem from the outside. And many students expressed hope for the semester ahead.\n\nSome changes are evident: University officials made clear that disruptions to classrooms, libraries and other learning spaces will not be tolerated. Restrictions were placed on who could join a social media group that had alarmed some students with slurs posted anonymously. Alan M. Garber, Harvard\u2019s interim president, recently announced task forces to combat antisemitism, as well as Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias. And the school held events aimed at fostering dialogue, including a panel with chaplains from multiple faiths, a student summit on free expression led by PEN America, and a discussion for faculty about engaging with difficult topics in the classroom.\n\nThe dean of Harvard College, Rakesh Khurana, told students in an email as the semester began that a commitment to freedom of expression is a hallmark of higher education.\n\nYet students have said they don\u2019t feel as though they can speak freely. In a survey of seniors last year, just over a third said they felt comfortable expressing opposing views about controversial topics in their classes. Only 44 percent said they had done that, \u201ceven when they thought it was essential to do so,\u201d Khurana wrote. And in conversations with students, faculty and staff, he said many had told him they feared getting \u201ccanceled.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purpose of a Harvard education is not to shield you from ideas you dislike or to silence people you disagree with,\u201d Khurana said. \u201cIt is to enable you to confront challenging ideas, interrogate your own beliefs, make up your mind, and learn to think for yourself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a national issue. In 2021, the Knight Foundation found that almost two-thirds of college students surveyed agreed that the climate at their school prevented some people from saying things they believe because others might find it offensive.\n\nAt Harvard this winter, it has urgency.\n\n\u201cWe are at a critical moment in our University\u2019s history,\u201d Khurana wrote to students. \u201cWe must show in word and deed that our university is committed to strengthening our democracy through our embrace of pluralism and tolerance.\u201d\n\nOn the first day of classes this semester, students found that posters on campus urging the return of Israeli hostages had been defaced.\n\nOn a photo of a baby holding a toy, someone had drawn an arrow toward the child\u2019s face and written, \u201cHEAD STILL ON.\u201d\n\nShabbos Kestenbaum, a graduate student at Harvard Divinity School, had been hoping things would get better this semester. \u201cI just want to go to class,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to study. \u2026 But it\u2019s just been a constant battle of facing antisemitism almost on a daily basis. \u2026 It\u2019s just so defeating and isolating.\u201d\n\nKestenbaum is one of six student plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against Harvard in January charging that the school has become a \u201cbastion of rampant anti-Jewish hatred and harassment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarc Kasowitz, an attorney for the Jewish students, has filed similar cases against the University of Pennsylvania and New York University. He said the problem at Harvard is rooted \u201cin thinking that the world is divided into oppressed and oppressors.\u201d In that view, Jews are viewed as the oppressors and the Palestinians are seen as oppressed, with resulting antisemitism \u2014 and lack of protection from the school \u2014 that is frightening many students.\n\nA spokesman for Harvard declined to comment on the pending litigation or the Office of Civil Rights complaint filed on behalf of Muslim and pro-Palestinian students. The university announced numerous efforts this fall and winter to combat antisemitism, including increasing security on campus and forming an inclusion and belonging student leadership council that includes Jewish members. The university also has taken steps to support pro-Palestinian students who were doxed, and Khurana condemned Islamophobia along with other forms of bigotry in a social media post days after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t feel safe,\u201d Kestenbaum said. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel welcome. And we don\u2019t think Harvard is serious about combating antisemitism.\u201d\n\nA few dozen students wearing kaffiyeh scarves gathered near the steps of Harvard\u2019s Widener Library one day recently and pulled on white surgical gloves. One of the protesters squirted red paint out of a bottle onto their outstretched hands, which they smeared into their palms. They climbed the steps, bearing a canvas banner that read, \u201cSTOP THE GENOCIDE IN GAZA,\u201d held their red hands up and cried, \u201cFree Palestine!\u201d\n\nThen some of the students hurried along wet pathways through campus to the law school. There, John Fossum, a second-year law student from Houston, began clicking tent poles together and poking the ends into the muddy grass.\n\nSome pro-Palestinian student groups had announced on social media a \u201creturn to campus, not normalcy,\u201d using tents to symbolize the conditions of people who have been displaced in Gaza. A dozen students stood by an orange and gray tent, handing out fliers.\n\nWithin minutes, two men approached: The students hadn\u2019t registered an event in advance. The protesters, including members of Law Students for a Free Palestine, politely tried to convince the staff members that it wasn\u2019t an event but, after a few minutes, dismantled the tent as directed. They headed for the plaza in front of the Science Center, where they had gotten permission to gather, put their banners back up and continued to hand out fliers.\n\nIsraa Alzamli, who is in her third year at Harvard Law, said there are power dynamics at play regarding who has access to influential voices such as donors and politicians. Some pro-Palestinian students have been doxed, had their faces displayed on a truck labeled as antisemites and had their names shared on do-not-hire lists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlzamli has shared photos of body bags with her family name on them, she said. \u201cAnd then I come to campus, and I have to deal with being called antisemitic, with being told that I am making calls for genocide, when I am just advocating for violence to stop.\u201d\n\nShe said she has been trying, with teach-ins, to get people to talk about the issues despite hostile questions. But she asked, \u201cWhat does it mean to disagree about the complete ethnic cleansing of a group of people?\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean to engage with somebody who denies your humanity?\u201d\n\nAnd she said: \u201cWhy should you have to?\u201d\n\nDaylyn Gilbert, a senior from Texas studying economics and computer science, said she thinks most people at Harvard are more centrist and open-minded than it may seem: \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of diversity of thought on campus. It\u2019s just not obvious because there are some voices that are so loud and some that are so quiet.\u201d\n\nShe has avoided talking about the war and tensions on campus, unless she knows the person feels the same way she does. She took a walk with one friend she knew had a completely contrary view and they talked about how they didn\u2019t want anything to come between their friendship, Gilbert said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t actually talk about the war itself.\u201d\n\nShira Hoffer, a junior from New Hampshire, had been part of the school\u2019s Intellectual Vitality Committee, which looks at ways to promote curious, respectful dialogue on campus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a postscript to an email she sent to her dorm in early October, she said she had worked as a mediator and on dialogue issues, and would be happy to have a nonjudgmental conversation if anyone had questions. Within five minutes, she received a text asking her what she thought was the best solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nHoffer responded that she had no idea and shared four very different ideas from other people.\n\nShe quickly realized there was much more demand than one person with a cellphone could handle. She assembled a team of volunteers for a fledgling nonprofit group, the Hotline for Israel/Palestine, which hundreds of people have now texted. Instead of offering opinions, volunteers provide white papers and other resources from organizations with different views.\n\nHoffer is happy that people are asking. Too often, she said, there\u2019s a fundamental lack of curiosity about opposing views \u2014 understandable for people who feel they have moral certainty on a given issue. She doesn\u2019t expect that will change immediately. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly something to strive for.\u201d\n\nAt Michael Sandel\u2019s \u201cHard Questions\u201d event, people laughed as they watched video clips of the professor in conversation with director Michael B. Jordan and comedian Conan O\u2019Brien, who is an alumnus, about the ethics of technology, and they volunteered answers to questions he posed to the audience, such as whether technology would change what it means to be human.\n\nAs Sandel and the students asked follow-up questions, people often paused in thought, formulating their responses and sometimes changing their views as they considered others\u2019 points.\n\nAs the event ended, students walked out, still debating the issues as they headed to dinner in the rain. Those kinds of conversations are foundational to a liberal arts education, Sandel said, part of the important process of figuring out what they believe and why.\n\nJason Hsu, a student at Harvard Kennedy School who is from Taiwan, said afterward that he enjoyed the event. He only wished that it touched more on the core issues the school is struggling with.\n\nWhen Hsu was walking across Harvard Yard the day before, it hit him: \u201c\u2018Wow, we just lost a president.\u2019 That kind of eerie feeling \u2014 it sank heavily in my stomach,\u201d he said. But he had found people reluctant to talk about what had happened.\n\nA number of things led to the president\u2019s resignation, he said, including the Oct. 7 attack, antisemitism and the congressional testimony \u2014 events that almost like algorithms are interpretable. \u201cI think we owe an explanation to ourselves, a conversation as to what exactly happened, and how do we think about these issues?\u201d"}

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight \u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t get a lot of help from major Republican institutions, but he did from the NRA,\u201d NBC political guru Chuck Todd said as Trump declared victory on election night. \u201cThis is a big night for the NRA.\u201d\n\nIt was a crowning achievement for the gun-rights lobby, capping decades of power brokering in Republican primaries and statewide races and setting the stage for the NRA to wield outsize influence during Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut as the former president stages his political comeback, the NRA has tumbled from power. Internal feuds, corruption allegations and an onslaught of litigation have ravaged the group\u2019s finances and public image. Longtime chief executive Wayne LaPierre stepped down amid a civil corruption trial in New York expected to last until mid-February, with prosecutors claiming he and other NRA leaders cheated donors by squandering millions on personal expenses. On the stand, LaPierre has confirmed various luxury trips and other perks charged to the NRA over several years, including private jet travel to family vacations, helicopter flights for NRA executives attending NASCAR events, and hair and makeup services for his wife when she attended NRA events. D.C.\u2019s attorney general is also alleging the group misused charitable funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA has never faced a more perilous moment: It is hemorrhaging money and members, uncertain about the next generation of leadership and facing the possibility of court-ordered oversight, all at a time when gun-control groups are gaining strength amid constant mass shootings. As Trump closes in on the Republican presidential nomination, some current and former leaders concede the organization is too depleted to spend significantly on his campaign.\n\n\u201cThe presidential race is always important, but the NRA has finite resources and needs to maximize its impact,\u201d said David Keene, a longtime board member and former president. \u201cThe money we have might be better spent on closely contested, down-ballot races.\u201d\n\nYet the NRA\u2019s struggles do not signal doom for the gun-rights movement as liberals have long predicted. Its legacy endures in a Republican Party that casts even modest gun-control proposals as attacks on the individual\u2019s constitutional right to self-defense, and in Trump\u2019s MAGA movement, where the NRA\u2019s hostility toward government bureaucracy is deeply internalized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe NRA was Trump before Trump,\u201d said Nick Suplina, a senior vice president at Everytown for Gun Safety, a leading gun-control group. \u201cThe NRA taught a lot of the Republican Party about what it means to be in the vanguard of the culture war \u2014 what the uncompromising, come-and-take it, conspiracy theory-minded populists look like, and they\u2019ve been tapping into that for a really long time.\u201d\n\nThe story of the NRA\u2019s downturn, told through court documents, financial records and interviews with current and former officials, makes clear that the years of lax oversight and self-dealing described in the ongoing New York trial have brought one of the most influential grass-roots organizations in the United States to a historic low \u2014 while fueling the rise of further-right firearms groups.\n\nSince 2016, NRA revenue fell more than 40 percent, while membership dues were down roughly 50 percent, according to tax filings through the end of 2022. Between 2018 and 2022, tax filings show the NRA spent more than $181 million on legal expenses \u2014 more than three times the amount it spent on federal candidates over the past three election cycles, according to spending tracked by OpenSecrets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s honestly just a dead man walking right now,\u201d said former NRA board member Phillip Journey, who left the board last year and is campaigning for another term as a reformer. \u201cOver my last three-year term in the NRA, we lost over a million members. That\u2019s a thousand a day. ... I\u2019m scared to death that someday the [NRA] magazine just won\u2019t show up in my mailbox.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, NRA spokesman Billy McLaughlin said the organization is still a powerful defender of the Second Amendment. The NRA scored \u201cplentiful\u201d victories in recent years, he said, pointing to the organization\u2019s role in a landmark 2022 Supreme Court ruling on the right to carry a handgun outside the home, in passing more state laws making it easier to carry concealed weapons, and in Republican Jeff Landry\u2019s 2023 gubernatorial victory in Louisiana.\n\n\u201cCurrent economic conditions are challenging for many organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cYet the NRA still prevails, much to the chagrin of our detractors.\u201d\n\nPeaks and valleys\n\nThe original mission of the NRA, chartered in 1871, was to boost marksmanship, not the Second Amendment. The group was best known for promoting shooting sports, hunting and firearms safety until 1975, when the NRA launched the aggressive lobbying and voter-contact operation that has become its trademark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaPierre, an experienced political hand, took over the NRA in 1991 and built a juggernaut that could make or break legislation and campaigns. The NRA primed millions of supporters for Election Day with postcards grading the gun-rights records of their representatives in Congress.\n\nA striking example of NRA political might came in late 2012, when a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Amid the public outcry, Congress weighed expanding background checks and banning many semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.\n\nJust one week after the massacre, a defiant LaPierre accused gun-control activists of fearmongering and demanded armed guards in schools. Democrats joined Republicans in bowing to the gun lobby, and legislators voted down one proposal after another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, Trump, then a real estate mogul turned reality television star, endorsed President Barack Obama\u2019s call for action on gun control. As a Republican primary candidate in 2016, however, Trump dubbed himself \u201ca Second Amendment person\u201d and bashed gun-free zones. The NRA rallied behind him months earlier than previous candidates and unleashed a record-breaking advertising blitz that cast Democrat Hillary Clinton as a dire threat to the Second Amendment.\n\nOnce Trump won the election, a pattern developed after mass shootings: The president would demand stronger background checks. NRA leaders would appeal directly to Trump. And the calls from the White House would fade.\n\nBehind the scenes, though, the powerful gun-rights group was beginning to fracture. Its election-year spending spree in 2016, had left a $45.8 million budget shortfall, according to tax filings. In a tipping point, the gun-control movement outpaced the gun-rights lobby for the first time in the 2018 midterm elections with more than $12 million to $10 million in outside spending on federal candidates. Revenue, including membership dues, began to decline in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s internal battle burst into public view at the annual convention in April 2019, where President Oliver North, the leading figure in the Iran-contra scandal in the late 1980s, was ousted after he and LaPierre publicly traded accusations of financial misconduct. An ugly, litigious falling out between the NRA and its longtime advertising agency, Ackerman McQueen, exposed exorbitant spending by LaPierre, including six-figure charges to a Beverly Hills boutique and posh travel to Italy and the Bahamas. In the wake of the 2018 mass killing of 17 students and staff members at a Parkland, Fla., high school, LaPierre asked the nonprofit group to buy him a $6 million, 10,000-square-foot mansion in a gated community near Dallas, citing safety concerns.\n\nAmid the negative publicity, LaPierre \u2014 long the pugnacious face of the group\u2019s messaging \u2014 largely faded from public view. His appearances on the major Sunday morning news shows, which peaked after the mass killing at Columbine High School in 1999, gradually declined, according to an analysis by MediaMatters, a liberal watchdog group. LaPierre\u2019s last Sunday morning appearance on broadcast networks was in 2017. That was also the year in which he last appeared on a weekday Fox News show, according to MediaMatters.\n\nIn August 2020, the attorneys general of New York and D.C. sued the NRA, alleging widespread financial improprieties. The NRA sought bankruptcy protection the following year and announced a move from New York, where it is chartered, to Texas. Testimony and court documents revealed that LaPierre failed to advise NRA directors about the filing, concealed free trips on an NRA contractor\u2019s luxury yacht, and spent $65,000 of the charity\u2019s money on Christmas gifts for staff. A federal judge in 2021 blocked the bankruptcy attempt, which he called a bad-faith end run around the New York attorney general\u2019s suit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was so much corruption, and they didn\u2019t want any of that getting out,\u201d said former board member Roscoe \u201cRocky\u201d Marshall, who is running for another term on a reform platform. \u201cThey really wanted the board to rubber stamp stuff. They didn\u2019t want the board to disagree with anything.\u201d\n\nDonations to the NRA slumped as the organization fell into disarray. Spending on Trump\u2019s reelection campaign in 2020 dipped by 46 percent from the last presidential election cycle, to about $17 million. Member dues nosedived from $170 million in 2018 to $83 million in 2022, according to tax records.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe organization reduced spending on firearms training, hunter services and other flagship programs. But it could not keep up with legal bills, which mushroomed from less than $7 million in 2017 to an average of $36 million annually over the next several years, according to tax filings. From 2016 to 2022, the NRA reported budget shortfalls in five of those seven years, ending 2022 in a $22.5 million hole, the filings show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe NRA is in a financial spiral that will not be easy to recover from,\u201d said Brian Mittendorf, an Ohio State University accounting professor who has studied the organization\u2019s finances.\n\nIn May 2022, a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Tex., killed 21 people, including children, and rocked the nation. A month later, 14 Republicans in the House and 15 in the Senate helped pass the most significant gun legislation since the early 1990s. The new law expanded criminal background checks, funded mental health services and widened the ban on domestic violence offenders purchasing firearms.\n\n\u201cThat was really a wake-up call,\u201d said Keene, the NRA board member. \u201cIn retrospect, we clearly didn\u2019t blow the alarm enough.\u201d\n\nThe NRA did not exact sweeping electoral vengeance on the renegades. Of the 29 Republicans, only about one-third were on the 2022 ballot, and most of those members received downgrades from the NRA or kept their low grades, according to data compiled by Everytown. Those who were not reelected were muscled out by Trump-backed candidates or because their districts became more Democratic, not directly because of their support for the bill.\n\nContributions by the NRA\u2019s political committee and spending by the lobbying arm have plunged since Trump\u2019s watershed victory. In last year\u2019s election in Virginia, when Democrats gained a House majority and retained Senate control, Everytown said it spent more than eight times as much as the NRA.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally a zombie company,\u201d said Josh Powell, LaPierre\u2019s former chief of staff, who was initially named as a defendant in the New York case but reached a settlement with the attorney general to pay $100,000 to benefit NRA charities. \u201cWhat\u2019s everybody afraid of?\u201d\n\nThe NRA on trial\n\nIn early January, days before the trial in New York began, LaPierre abruptly announced he was stepping down after more than four decades in the NRA \u2014 marking the end of an era and signaling the challenges ahead as the organization searches for his successor.\n\nLaPierre, 74, cited health reasons in his resignation letter, and a letter from his doctor to the judge says he suffers from Lyme disease and \u201ccognitive decline,\u201d among other conditions.\n\nThe trial has featured a number of former NRA insiders who broke with LaPierre and testified for Letitia James, the attorney general. North, the former president, told jurors that he was pushed out after raising alarms about LaPierre\u2019s \u201castronomical\u201d spending on lawyers. The attorneys were \u201cthe only reason I\u2019m not going to spend the rest of my life in an orange jumpsuit,\u201d LaPierre responded, according to North\u2019s testimony.\n\n\u201cNRA is a charity, and these people, through corruption and greed, have literally destroyed it and gutted it,\u201d said Marshall in an interview; the former board member also testified for the prosecution.\n\nIn the courtroom, NRA officials have sought to distance the organization from its longtime leader. The NRA is \u201cnot Wayne LaPierre,\u201d NRA attorney Sarah Rogers said, adding that LaPierre was a \u201cvisionary\u201d but \u201cnot always a meticulous corporate executive.\u201d\n\nLaPierre\u2019s lawyers have defended his travel and clothing expenses as the doing-business costs of cultivating wealthy donors. He flies on private planes, they said, out of security concerns. Court records show he repaid the NRA more than $990,000 since 2019 for expenses classified under IRS rules as \u201cexcess benefits,\u201d beyond what would be considered reasonable compensation.\n\nDuring his recent testimony, LaPierre confirmed numerous private jet trips and luxury car services charged to the NRA over several years, including a $37,000, one-way flight to the Bahamas for his family\u2019s annual summer vacation on a contractor\u2019s luxury yacht. Asked if a chef would prepare their meals, he said, \u201cNot all the time, but sometimes.\u201d\n\nIf LaPierre, former treasurer Wilson \u201cWoody\u201d Phillips and general counsel John Frazer are found liable, they could be ordered to reimburse the NRA and be barred from ever leading a charity in New York. The attorney general is also asking the court to seek recommendations from a governance expert and to appoint a financial monitor.\n\nBut to NRA loyalists, the case in New York is a political vendetta, much in the same way they view the multiple criminal cases against Trump as a witch hunt. James, a Democrat, is seeking to penalize NRA leaders for alleged fraud at the same time she is pursuing a $370 million civil fraud judgment against Trump.\n\n\u201cThere is no question about the intent of using the court to attempt to take Donald Trump out and to take the NRA out,\u201d said former senator Larry Craig (R-Idaho), one of the NRA\u2019s longest-serving board members. \u201cThe courts are being politically weaponized.\u201d\n\nIn D.C., the attorney general is accusing the NRA\u2019s foundation of funneling millions of dollars to the group without proper oversight and despite conflicts of interests. A trial is scheduled to begin April 29. The two civil cases threaten to drain the NRA\u2019s finances and distract from its mission just as the 2024 campaign season is getting underway.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re basically out of the election cycle,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cThose dollars are just not there.\u201d\n\nNRA board members argue that money isn\u2019t everything in campaigns, especially in a year when billions of dollars will flood the presidential race. The NRA\u2019s super power has long been its ability to mobilize an army of gun-rights supporters to swamp polls on Election Day.\n\n\u201cWill we have the kind of money to spend that we have had in the past? No, and that\u2019s a fact,\u201d Craig said. \u201cBut we will activate the grass-roots as best we can, and that can be done through social media and other efforts.\u201d\n\nA bullish movement\n\nEven as NRA\u2019s downturn takes center stage in a New York courtroom, the gun-rights movement is bullish on its future.\n\nThe organization\u2019s internal strife has been a boon to other gun-rights groups on the far right. Gun Owners of America, which claims 2 million members, touts a \u201cno compromise\u201d posture that led the group to view Trump as unfit for an endorsement in 2016. The leader of the National Association for Gun Rights recently denounced Trump, in part for his administration\u2019s 2018 ban on bump stocks after a Las Vegas gunman in 2017 used the devices to kill 58 people in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\n\u201cEach of those entities are competing to be as far right as they can,\u201d said David Pucino, legal director at Giffords, a gun-control advocacy organization. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing some of the extreme groups\u2019 influence on our politics and our legal system.\u201d\n\nWhile none of these groups are on track to supplant the NRA brand, their growth suggests gun-rights advocates no longer need a preeminent institution to lead the way in a hyperpartisan environment.\n\n\u201cNRA\u2019s strength has really not been the headquarters. NRA\u2019s strength has been the membership,\u201d said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, another NRA rival. \u201cThere\u2019s so many ways of getting millions of gun owners out there, to get them engaged and active now. It\u2019s a different playing field.\u201d\n\nRevenue rose 67 percent for Gottlieb\u2019s group from 2016 to 2022, according to tax filings, which he attributed, in part, to increasing support from a firearms industry wary of NRA turmoil. Other gun-rights groups have been outspending the NRA on federal lobbying since 2018, according to OpenSecrets.\n\n\u201cThe NRA is not the gun-rights movement,\u201d said 71-year-old Martin Phillips of Wichita, a longtime NRA member who also belongs to Gun Owners of America. If the NRA disappeared, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s not going to stop the gun rights movement at all. It\u2019s a God-given right to protect yourself.\u201d\n\nAt the same time mass killings have led to a surge of gun-control initiatives in blue states, the NRA and other gun-rights groups have successfully lobbied red states to loosen restrictions. Last year, Florida and Nebraska became the 26th and 27th \u201cconstitutional carry\u201d states, passing laws that allow gun owners to carry without concealed-weapons permits.\n\n\u201cThe opposition has thought they need to neutralize the NRA and get Wayne out of the way and everything will be fine,\u201d Keene said. \u201cBut these gun owners believe so strongly in their rights whether we drop the ball or carry it.\u201d\n\nThe gun rights movement also has found an ally in a Supreme Court stocked with Trump-appointed conservatives. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down New York\u2019s century-old law requiring a specific need to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense, a landmark ruling making it easier to challenge regulations in other states. The court\u2019s conservative supermajority has agreed to hear in March the NRA\u2019s argument that the New York financial regulator is violating the First Amendment by pressuring banks and insurers to boycott the gun lobby.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican frontrunner is signaling his loyalty to the embattled group. Trump is scheduled to address an NRA event in Pennsylvania next week, bringing gun rights to the forefront of a campaign that, so far, has featured little to no debate over policy. Trump\u2019s speech will be his eighth appearance before NRA members since 2015.\n\n\u201cIt is significant that Trump sees the NRA as a force multiplier,\u201d said Ken Blackwell, a former Ohio secretary of state and longtime board member, said of Trump\u2019s upcoming speech. \u201cThis is a sign that our partnership is alive and well.\u201d\n\nPublic support for stricter gun laws has increased by 6 percentage points since 2017, according to a Pew Research Center report conducted in June. A closer look at the data, however, finds stark partisan divides: 79 percent of people who often vote Republican says gun ownership increases safety in the United States, while 78 percent of frequent Democratic voters say it reduces safety.\n\nDemonstrating the NRA\u2019s arc of influence, pressure from the group a decade ago led then-Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) to vote against an assault weapons ban after the Sandy Hook shooting \u2014 a vote he regrets. Now, the gun lobby holds little to no sway over Democrats in Congress. Udall, who lost his Senate seat in 2014 to an NRA-backed challenger, wonders whether the NRA will be a player in November\u2019s election."}

Freeh was already working with Hunter, but seemed intent on reeling in the senior Biden. \u201cI would be delighted to do future work with you. I also spoke to [your] Dad a few weeks ago and would like to explore with him some future work options,\u201d Freeh, who ran an international security firm, wrote in July 2016. \u201cI believe that working together on these (and other legal) matters would be of value, fun and rewarding.\u201d\n\nThe message arrived as Joe Biden was contemplating a novel idea for the first time in nearly five decades: what life outside of elected office might look like. It came during a four-year period \u2014 from May 2015, when his son Beau died and Joe Biden lost his purpose, to April 2019, when he launched a presidential campaign and in a very real way regained it \u2014 that marked one of the most trying periods in Biden\u2019s life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis path for once was not mapped out by a series of political campaigns. Seemingly out of politics, Biden pursued a range of private options for the first time, trying to figure out what he wanted to do and who he wanted to be, all while seeking to stabilize a family reeling from death and addiction, love affairs and divorce.\n\nBeau Biden, beyond a beloved son, was seen as the family\u2019s political future. His death upended his father\u2019s life and ultimately set him on his current course, putting him back on a presidential path he had all but abandoned.\n\n\u201cEverything would have been 180 degrees different if Beau had lived \u2014 there\u2019s no question,\u201d said one close associate of the family who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private family matters. \u201cI don\u2019t think Hunter\u2019s life goes off the rails. If Beau wasn\u2019t president of the United States now, he\u2019d be on his way to it. And Joe Biden would never have been president. He would be happily retired.\u201d\n\nIt is this very period in Joe Biden\u2019s life that House Republicans are now scrutinizing in their impeachment inquiry. So far, rather than demonstrating that Biden engaged in financial wrongdoing, a review of documents, congressional testimony and emails authenticated by The Washington Post suggests he was uncharacteristically rudderless and casting about for a new role.\n\nIt would not have been illegal or even necessarily improper for him to do business with his son or with foreign entities, since he was out of politics \u2014 potentially complicating Republican efforts to build an impeachment case. Even so, he rarely took the numerous business opportunities dangled before him.\n\nAll the while, the Trump presidency was taking its brutal, chaotic path, paving the way for Biden\u2019s decision to reenter politics and try one last time for the office he had coveted his entire life.\n\nThe White House declined to comment for this story, but Biden in the past has discussed this time period and has recounted how his son Beau had urged him to stay politically active.\n\n\u201cBeau should be the one running for president,\u201d Biden said during a tearful interview with MSNBC in 2020. \u201cNot me.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery morning I get up,\u201d he added, \u201cI think to myself, \u2018Is he proud of me?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe calamity\n\nBiden\u2019s tight circle of advisers began plotting his post-political career as far back as 2010. His vice presidency would be over in 2017, and Beau Biden, at the time Delaware\u2019s attorney general, was the family\u2019s political future. It was time for the patriarch to exit political life.\n\nHe considered becoming an elder statesman, eying lofty foreign policy consultantships like those of former British prime minister Tony Blair or former secretary of state Madeleine Albright.\n\nHis team was approached about a \u201cBiden Law Group\u201d that would tackle asbestos litigation, Medicaid fraud and government consulting. Hunter and Beau Biden were both interested and proposed a further conversation with their father.\n\nBut the elder Biden seemed to have his sights elsewhere. \u201cHe\u2019s not a guy who thinks of that world. Everything is macro, political, global \u2014 he wanted to write a book and do speeches,\u201d said one person who consulted with the family. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to do business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the summer of 2013 came the shock that upended the family: Beau Biden, after suffering a seizure and being rushed to the hospital, was diagnosed with brain cancer. He began treatment but attempted to keep private the severity of the prognosis as he lived his life as normally as possible, even letting it be known that he was weighing a run for Delaware governor.\n\nIt took time for Joe Biden to fully face the implications.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden is a famously eternally hopeful person,\u201d said one person who was close to the family during that period. \u201cI think up until Beau went back to the hospital and then to Walter Reed \u2014 probably March or April of 2015 \u2014 I think everybody was holding onto hope he would be one of the small number of glioblastoma cases that has survival for many years.\u201d\n\nBeau died in May 2015, leaving the family utterly without direction. Hunter and Ashley, Biden\u2019s surviving children, spiraled into personal crisis, and Hunter\u2019s addiction problems became acute.\n\nFor longer than has been previously reported, many of those close to Biden clung to the idea that, with President Barack Obama leaving office, Biden could still enter the 2016 Democratic primary against Hillary Clinton, according to emails sent at the time.\n\nMany in the family, led by Hunter, had disdain for Clinton (\u201cF her,\u201d he wrote in February 2016 after a perceived slight of his father); disliked her husband, Bill (\u201cWhat an ahole. And God he looks like shit,\u201d Hunter wrote in April 2016 after Clinton blamed Biden for the 1994 crime bill); and derided consultant David Axelrod (\u201cWhat a complete and total asshole,\u201d he opined in October 2015 when Axelrod criticized a \u201cDraft Biden\u201d ad).\n\nThe Biden circle was particularly aghast at Hillary Clinton\u2019s struggle to handle a controversy over her private email server, according to emails on a laptop that Hunter Biden apparently dropped off at a repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden confidant Ted Kaufman passed along an article about the Clinton emails on Oct. 13, 2015, with the subject line, \u201cCancer.\u201d Nearly a year later, he sent around a story about the number of people Hillary met with who had donated to the Clinton Foundation, writing, \u201cThese people are ethically challenged.\u201d\n\nThe Clintons declined to comment. All this was not enough to persuade the outgoing vice president, overwhelmed by grief, to jump into the race.\n\n\u201cIt was really a man who for the first time in his life was not going to be in public office and was perfectly comfortable with that fact,\u201d said one of the people advising him around that time, adding, \u201cIt was very much, \u2018I\u2019m going to be a private citizen the rest of my life, and how can I be productive as a private citizen?\u2019\u201d\n\nA state of bewilderment\n\nThe Biden brain trust drew up papers for a Biden Foundation, seeking $500,000 contributions from longtime friends and supporters. His son and brother avidly pursued foreign business deals, but Biden was more interested in universities and nonprofits, according to emails and people who consulted with him.\n\nIn May 2016, Bob Bauer, Biden\u2019s private lawyer, approved talking points that said, among other things, \u201cThe VP plans to dedicate the rest of his life to this new stage of his public service\u201d and \u201cYou can see from our proposed website that the VP is planning for a very energetic post VP life.\u201d\n\nAt the center of that new life would be the foundation, which would \u201ccontinue his life\u2019s work in foreign policy, cancer research, equal treatment before the law, preventing violence against women and children, support of community colleges, and American veterans.\u201d\n\nBiden also met with several universities and planned an academic center on the vice presidency. Amid all this activity, he did not hide his bewilderment at the new phase that opened before him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been gainfully employed in my life. I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m going to do,\u201d he told an audience a few months before the 2016 election. \u201cYou know, I mean, I\u2019ve never cashed a paycheck in my entire life. You think I\u2019m joking \u2014 I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nOne of the most lucrative temptations was hitting the paid speech circuit, but Biden\u2019s circle knew that would risk a hit to his reputation, given the controversy that had erupted over speeches Hillary Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street groups.\n\nThe Post in 2019 found at least 65 instances when Biden gave a speech or appeared at a book event. But he avoided the backlash that engulfed Clinton, in part because many of his appearances were at university campuses, book events or health-care conventions.\n\nBiden also signed a deal shortly after leaving office that paid him a reported $8 million for three books, to be written by him and his wife, Jill. All told, in the two years after he left the vice presidency, he and his wife reported earning $15.6 million, according to tax returns he later made public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was more money than Biden had ever made in his life, and he began spending it, renting a large home in McLean, Va., and purchasing a $2.7 million, 4,800-square-foot vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Del. The beach house was one of the few material items he openly desired, according to one person close to the family, and he wanted each of his children and grandchildren to have a key.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nHe also created organizations to try to maintain a role in shaping public policy: the Biden Foundation, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware, the Biden Cancer Initiative.\n\nThe efforts show clearly how Biden saw himself \u2014 seasoned diplomat, scholar of government, global statesman. It\u2019s an image that has been hard to sustain in the bruising world of the presidency.\n\nFreeh makes his pitch\n\nHunter Biden connected with Freeh in June 2016 to enlist his help on the case of Gabriel Popoviciu, a Romanian real estate tycoon who was convicted in his country of corruption (an appeals court last year suspended his seven-year sentence).\n\nFreeh quickly agreed, and he turned toward the personal. \u201cYour Dad told me you have been an incredible father figure and strength for Beau\u2019s family, and what a precious gift to be able to bestow,\u201d Freeh wrote.\n\nFreeh at the time was working for clients facing serious charges abroad, and he also mentioned to Hunter the idea of partnering with his father.\n\n\u201cNo doubt both he and you have many options and probably some which are more attractive than my small shop,\u201d Freeh wrote on Aug. 24, 2016 \u2014 though he noted that his firm did have offices in Washington, Delaware and New York and was representing the Malaysian prime minister. \u201cI\u2019m very flexible and we could set it up as an equity-share or whatever works best. It would certainly be an honor to work with you both.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout six months later, with Joe Biden now out of office, Freeh wrote to Hunter Biden again, saying that he had seen his father at Catholic Mass. \u201cIf you have his cell and a personal email, I\u2019d like to have his contacts (will protect),\u201d Freeh wrote on March 17, 2017. \u201cI would still like to persuade him to associate with me and FSS \u2014 as we have some very good and profitable matters which he could enhance with minimal time.\u201d\n\nFreeh was referring to Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan, the firm he co-founded with former judges Stanley Sporkin and Eugene Sullivan.\n\nIn an email to The Post, Freeh said that, like Biden, he attends St. Joseph on the Brandywine in Wilmington, Del. He has long been friends with the Bidens, he said, and he sits on the board of the Beau Biden Foundation.\n\nHe said that in late 2016 and early 2017, he had several conversations with Biden about joining his firm. \u201cHe considered it but decided to pursue other goals,\u201d Freeh said.\n\nUsing Joe Biden as bait\n\nIf Joe Biden shied away from potentially lucrative opportunities, other members of his family did not.\n\nHunter Biden and his uncle James, Joe\u2019s brother, pursued a high-stakes deal around this time with a group of Chinese energy executives. With Joe Biden seemingly out of public life, they had little reason to keep their distance from firms based in China or other potentially controversial partners.\n\nHunter and James Biden teamed up with several associates who would later resurface in House Republicans\u2019 investigation of President Biden, including Rob Walker, James Gilliar and Tony Bobulinski. On several occasions, this group tried to use the outgoing vice president\u2019s cachet to attract potential partners.\n\nWalker, in an interview with FBI and IRS agents, recounted a lunch with the Chinese executives at Washington\u2019s Four Seasons Hotel when Joe Biden stopped by for a brief visit. Walker said he thought Hunter had arranged for his father to drop by to bolster the chances of a deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut within weeks, the would-be partners began to worry that their opportunity was slipping away, and Gilliar embraced a way to make their bid more enticing: enlist the former vice president. \u201cMan U are right let\u2019s get the company set up, then tell H and family the high stakes and get Joe involved,\u201d Gilliar wrote to Bobulinski on May 11, 2017, in a text message reported by Fox News in December 2020.\n\nTwo days later, Gilliar sent an email titled \u201cExpectations,\u201d outlining a possible equity distribution from the deal. It included \u201c10 held by H for the big guy,\u201d suggesting 10 percent that Joe Biden would receive. Republicans have highlighted this email, saying it shows Biden benefited from his son\u2019s foreign business career despite denials from both Bidens.\n\nWalker has testified, however, that the idea of including Joe Biden was \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d Gilliar, who did not respond to messages seeking comment, told the Wall Street Journal in October 2020 that, \u201cI am unaware of any involvement at anytime of the former Vice President.\u201d\n\nLending a hand\n\nAfter Hunter and James Biden signed a deal with the Chinese executives, money began flowing. During a 14-month period starting in August 2017, CEFC China Energy and its executives paid $4.8 million to entities controlled by the two, according to financial records reviewed by The Post.\n\nBut apparently it was not enough, as both Hunter and James still turned to Joe Biden for financial help. On Jan. 12, 2018, according to bank records, Joe Biden lent $200,000 to James. About seven weeks later, on March 1, 2018, the loan was repaid.\n\nJames Biden\u2019s attorney, Paul J. Fishman, said that \u201cat no time did Jim involve his brother in any of his business relationships.\u201d He declined to respond to questions about why James Biden had needed the large sum.\n\nLater that year, after the CEFC deal collapsed, Hunter Biden wrote to ask his father for a short-term loan so he could pay alimony bills, his kids\u2019 tuition and the fees for a rehab program.\n\nHe promised to repay Joe Biden within 10 days. \u201cI\u2019m really embarrassed to ask and I know it\u2019s unfair of me to put you in that position right now,\u201d Hunter wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem but call me,\u201d his father replied. \u201cHunt tell me what you need. No problem.\u201d He offered to pay tuition and housing bills for Hunter\u2019s daughters and to provide the rest directly to Hunter, saying $75,000 would be sent that day.\n\nIt does not appear that the money helped much in the long term. Later that month, Hunter, in a message to his uncle, said that even if he worked every day for three months he would not be able to dig out of his financial hole.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t pay alimony w/o Dad or tuitions or for food and gas,\u201d he wrote on Dec. 29, 2018. \u201cReally it\u2019s all gone.\u201d\n\nHunter\u2019s credit scores were so low that he had trouble buying a car. Instead, Joe Biden signed for a 2018 Ford Raptor truck, and Hunter repaid his father with several monthly payments of $1,380. After about a year, he returned the truck to the dealer.\n\nRep. James Comer (R-Ky.), who is leading the GOP investigation of the Bidens, has held up the loan repayments from James and Hunter Biden as evidence that the former vice president was getting \u201claundered China money.\u201d But both seem to be instances of family members reimbursing Joe Biden for money he had lent out to them. James and Hunter Biden are both scheduled to testify this month before Comer\u2019s committee.\n\nBack into the fray\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s life outside politics, of course, did not last long.\n\nFor two years, he spent much of his time in the refined world of foundations and academic centers. His speaking contracts required that he be supplied with a pre-speech meal of angel hair pomodoro, a caprese salad and raspberry sorbet with biscotti.\n\nBut by this time, Hillary Clinton had lost in a devastating upset, and Trump\u2019s presidency was unfolding as an affront to everything Biden stood for.\n\nBefore he died, Beau had made his father promise that he would stay engaged in public life. With no obvious Democrat to pull the party together, Biden, by his own account, concluded that the way to live up to that promise was to run for a nomination he had twice failed to win.\n\nBy early 2019, Biden\u2019s aides began planning another presidential campaign. They met at his McLean house, a dwelling that looked much like a brick version of the White House a few miles away.\n\nAt one point, Naomi Biden, Hunter\u2019s daughter and Biden\u2019s oldest granddaughter, called a family meeting. Joe Biden\u2019s grandchildren told him that they knew a presidential campaign would provoke scrutiny and stress, but they were ready for it.\n\nBiden\u2019s advisers saw Hunter Biden, with his history of drug addiction, as a liability \u2014 and, unbeknownst to them, the FBI in 2018 had opened an investigation of Hunter for potential tax crimes and, according to court filings that until recently remained sealed, would soon obtain warrants to review Hunter Biden\u2019s emails and iCloud data. Campaign aides identified James Biden, who had a long history of troubled business deals and legal problems, as another vulnerability.\n\nThat had not been much of a concern as long as the former vice president was not seeking public office.

Kennedy International Airport in New York into a mob of thousands of shrieking youngsters who welcomed them to America like conquering heroes. And, indeed, over the next two weeks, they made three TV appearances on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d to record-breaking audiences, gave sold-out concert performances at Carnegie Hall and the Washington Coliseum, triggered saturation-playing of their hit songs on AM radio stations throughout the country, and staged a series of news conferences in which their cheeky humor outwitted and disarmed the press corps in New York, Washington, D.C., and Miami.\n\nCommentators were so lost for words to describe the power of what was happening that they fell back on natural phenomena, using terms such as \u201cwhirlwind,\u201d \u201ctidal wave\u201d and \u201ccultural earthquake.\u201d\n\nBut the Beatles\u2019 conquest of America, which began 60 years ago this week, was a man-made event. And the man most responsible was the band\u2019s suave, self-confident 29-year-old manager. Brian Epstein seldom gets the credit he deserves, in part because he was gay in an era when British law still deemed homosexual acts a crime, and in part because he was Jewish, which British society largely disdained. But also because the Beatles, who were often coldhearted when it came to money matters, badmouthed his business acumen after his death in 1967.\n\nSkip to end of carousel The Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting.

Without his charm, persistence and unwavering devotion, the Beatles would never have emerged from their hometown of Liverpool, let alone Britain, and never would have made it to America.\n\n\u201cLike (with) any success story, everyone wants to take credit,\u201d Robert Precht, Ed Sullivan\u2019s producer and son-in-law, would tell author Gerald Nachman, looking back four decades later. \u201cMy take on the whole thing was that it was Epstein who really engineered everything. It was largely his doing \u2014 the promotion and radio exposure and where he wanted the Beatles to go. That was all his maneuvering.\u201d\n\nBrian Epstein was managing his family\u2019s thriving record shop in downtown Liverpool when he wandered down to the Cavern, a subterranean music club, one afternoon in November 1961 and first heard the local rock-and-roll band with the strange insect name. He didn\u2019t much care for their music but was enchanted by the insouciant charm and rough-and-ready look of the four handsome young men in black leather.\n\nHe was a man in search of a mission. The firstborn son of a family of affluent Orthodox Jewish merchants who owned a chain of five furniture, white goods and music stores throughout the region, Epstein had been expelled from or dropped out of eight private schools before ending his formal education. He didn\u2019t lack for intelligence but was, by his own account, bored and bullied at school and discouraged by teachers and parents from pursuing his creative interests in drawing, dress design and stage acting. By age 16, he was back in Liverpool, working as a salesman in the family business.\n\nHe was a delicately handsome man of medium height with sparkling blue eyes, full lips and well-trimmed curly brown hair. He favored bespoke suits and shirts, silk ties and calfskin shoes. He looked and smelled immaculate \u2014 like he\u2019d just emerged from a perfumed bath, one admirer noted \u2014 and he spoke with the polished oval tones of a BBC Radio 4 news presenter from an Oxbridge university. His adoring mother instilled in him an appreciation for classical art and music, while his father pressed him to embrace a role in the family business. But while he was developing a talent for business matters, the merchant life bored him and he sought several times to escape to London \u2014 to clerk at a bookstore, to serve as a British Army conscript, to pursue an acting career at the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Yet he always retreated to the family home and business when things invariably went wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s possible, of course, to love and honor your parents yet still feel the need to escape their smothering embrace. Especially when you are harboring a secret you know they would find devastating. Epstein\u2019s secret was his sexuality. He was a gay man in an era when homosexuality was considered both a crime and a kind of plague \u2014 dangerous, contagious and illegal. And to protect himself from the consequences of being discovered, he led a double life, feigning a respectability he often didn\u2019t feel. He agonized over embarrassing his parents, most notably after his arrest, conviction and probation sentence for importuning an undercover policeman in the men\u2019s room of a north London underground station in 1957, and again the following year when he was beaten and robbed after dark in Liverpool\u2019s largest public park.\n\nWatching the Beatles and observing the electrifying effect they had on young audiences was thrilling to him. \u201cI was excited to find that they had an extraordinary quality and presence that wafted itself across the cellar,\u201d he would recall in \u201cA Cellarful of Noise,\u201d his ghostwritten celebrity memoir. Soon he was telling anyone who would listen: \u201cI am completely confident that one day they will be bigger than Elvis Presley.\u201d\n\nDrawing on the theatrical skills he had developed at RADA, Epstein insisted that they discard their black leather jackets, torn blue jeans and cheap cowboy boots and dress in dark-gray mohair suits and Pierre Cardin-style lapelless outfits. His personal barber trimmed and shaped their pudding bowl haircuts. He ordered them to create a tight song list each night and stick to it \u2014 no more taking requests for songs they hadn\u2019t rehearsed, and no more extended solos. He told them to smile while they played \u2014 and then solemnly bow to the waist after each song.\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t do was compel the Beatles to rein in their irreverent and exuberant collective personality. They became postwar British youth personified \u2014 proud, unafraid and rebellious, yet several steps short of offensive.\n\nEpstein understood that the road to commercial success ran through London. But guitar bands from distant Liverpool were a tough sell to entertainment moguls certain that the only worthwhile show business acts were born or bred in the British capital. After being rejected by both EMI and Decca, conglomerates that controlled some 80 percent of recorded music in Britain, Epstein stumbled across a producer at Parlophone, one of EMI\u2019s lesser labels.\n\nLike Epstein, George Martin, a classically trained musician, was taken by the band\u2019s wit and charisma \u2014 so charmed that he allowed them to record their own songs, taught them how to polish and present their work in the recording studio, and was amazed when John Lennon and Paul McCartney started churning out strikingly original melodies with simple, passionate lyrics that mesmerized young female listeners.\n\nBy November 1963, they had sold more than 2.5 million records, had their own radio program and drew mobs of screaming teenagers at concerts who pursued them with a fierce and often scary intensity that the British press dubbed \u201cBeatlemania.\u201d\n\nTheir progress had been stupendous. But there was an even bigger mountain to climb.\n\nBrian Epstein called it \u201cOperation U.S.A.\u201d In early November 1963, he boarded a flight to New York and booked a suite at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue. He brought along Billy J. Kramer, a handsome 20-year-old singer from Liverpool whom he had recently signed and whose career was taking off thanks largely to Martin\u2019s expertise in the recording studio and songs donated by the Lennon-McCartney hit machine. Kramer was there to look good and help charm the parade of New York journalists and music industry promoters invited to have a drink and hear about the sensational new British band.\n\nThe uniform response was, \u201cSo what?\u201d Kramer would recall in his memoir, \u201cDo You Want to Know a Secret?\u201d They knew that no British pop music group had ever hit it big in America. \u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to be overly impressed.\u201d\n\nAn old friend from Liverpool introduced Epstein to David Garrard Lowe, a young journalist with Look magazine who was smitten by Epstein\u2019s intelligence and panache. But Lowe\u2019s editor said he would never publish photos of long-haired men in the magazine. \u201cHe looked down at the photos like it was nothing,\u201d Lowe recalled in a phone interview.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIf Epstein was disappointed, he didn\u2019t show it. \u201cI think that America is ready for the Beatles,\u201d he told New Yorker writer Thomas Whiteside for a Talk of the Town piece that Lowe helped arrange. \u201cWhen they come, they will hit this country for six.\u201d\n\nEpstein\u2019s main objective was to close a deal for the Beatles to perform on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show,\u201d America\u2019s top-rated TV variety program. Sullivan was primed for an agreement. He said he and his wife, Sylvia, had been on their way home from a London vacation when their flight was delayed for three hours while thousands of youngsters engulfed the airport runways to welcome the Beatles home from a brief concert tour in Sweden. \u201cWho the hell are the Beatles?\u201d Sullivan reputedly demanded.\n\nBefore becoming a television impresario, Sullivan had worked as a sports reporter and a Broadway columnist, and he prided himself on his journalistic instincts. \u201cBecause I am a newspaperman, whenever a Page 1 phenomenon occurs \u2014 whether it involves an unknown Presley \u2014 or the unknown Beatles \u2026 my newspaper training instinctively translates a Page 1 story into a Page 1 showbiz attraction,\u201d he boasted in a letter to British entertainment mogul Leslie Grade.\n\nEpstein and Sullivan met on Nov. 11 at Sullivan\u2019s apartment at the Delmonico Hotel. Sullivan had paid Presley $50,000 for three performances in 1956 and 1957 to woo the young Memphis sensation away from rival TV shows. But he only offered the Beatles $7,000 plus airfare and lodging for two appearances, one in New York on Feb. 9, 1964, and a second the following Sunday in a special broadcast from the Deauville Hotel in Miami. Epstein agreed to the terms but insisted that the Beatles get top billing for both shows. Sullivan hesitated. Precht, Sullivan\u2019s producer, told him it would be \u201cridiculous\u201d to give top billing to an English group virtually unknown in the United States.\n\nWhen the two men met again for dinner the following evening along with Precht, they agreed to add a third, taped appearance to be broadcast on Feb. 23, after the Beatles had returned to London. The group would receive a total of $10,000. Epstein went home satisfied. \u201cMy negotiation was not about the money but the appearances,\u201d he later explained to Tony Barrow, his hard-nosed public relations director, as Barrow recalled in his 2005 memoir. \u201cIt\u2019s unheard of for a new band to get three bookings in a row without a string of hit records.\u201d\n\nSullivan soon was complaining that the smooth-talking Epstein had outsmarted him. \u201cEd was really upset,\u201d John Moffitt, associate director for the show, recalled in a taped oral history interview. Sullivan told Jack Babb, his talent coordinator: \u201cIt\u2019s not the money, Jack. It\u2019s who wants to see them three times? They\u2019re a flash in the pan. They\u2019re hot now, but, you know, we\u2019re going to have to pay them off for that last show.\u201d\n\nAs crucial as the Sullivan deal was, Epstein knew he needed more. The Beatles themselves had been insistent \u2014 we can\u2019t go to America, they told Epstein, unless and until we have a hit record there. They feared, as did he, they would wind up playing in half-empty theaters or worse. Curiously, their biggest obstacle was their American record company.\n\nCapitol Records was a Hollywood-based company famous for its glittering roster of mainstream entertainers like Benny Goodman, Nat King Cole, Peggy Lee, Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. In 1955, EMI had purchased a 95 percent interest in Capitol. The deal gave Capitol first refusal for the U.S. rights to EMI artists. But while the Beatles were producing hit after hit in Britain throughout 1963, Capitol\u2019s executives declined to release their songs in the United States, reciting over and over the mantra that American audiences had no interest in an obscure British rock-and-roll band. Dave Dexter Jr., the man in charge of monitoring the international market for potential hits, was consistently dismissive of the Beatles, starting with \u201cLove Me Do,\u201d their first British single. \u201cAlan, they\u2019re a bunch of long-haired kids,\u201d he told Alan Livingston, Capitol\u2019s president. \u201cThey\u2019re nothing. Forget it.\u201d\n\nAngry and frustrated, Epstein entered into a distribution deal with Vee-Jay, an obscure, Chicago-based, Black-owned record company, which released \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d and \u201cFrom Me to You,\u201d to no detectable acclaim. Vee-Jay even misspelled the band\u2019s name on the first single: \u201cThe Beattles.\u201d Epstein then licensed \u201cShe Loves You\u201d to Swan Records, a small Philadelphia-based label, where it too died a swift death for lack of media attention and airplay.\n\nAfter he returned to London from New York, Epstein placed a call to Livingston. He told Livingston that \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201d the Beatles\u2019 forthcoming release, had what he called \u201can American sound,\u201d and he pleaded with Capitol\u2019s president to give it a listen. Livingston would later claim that he heard something attractive in the song and decided to distribute it. He even agreed to Epstein\u2019s demand that he commit $40,000 to publicizing the new single.\n\n\u201cI liked Brian just then on the telephone,\u201d he recalled in a BBC interview published in 2000. \u201cHe was a gentleman, and he was persuasive.\u201d\n\nPerhaps so. But a more plausible account came from Paul Marshall, an American entertainment lawyer working with EMI. He said company chairman Joseph Lockwood was keenly aware that Beatles songs were raking in several million pounds in Britain and believed they could do the same in America. Asked once by Time magazine what his favorite records were, Lockwood replied, \u201cThe ones that sell.\u201d Capitol\u2019s knee-jerk rejection mystified him. He finally dispatched EMI Managing Director L.G. Wood to New York for a showdown with Livingston. \u201cL.G. wasn\u2019t asking anymore,\u201d Marshall told Beatles biographer Bob Spitz. \u201cHe told Alan, \u2018You must take it.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne factor working in the Beatles\u2019 favor was that the American press and media were finally beginning to take notice of the band as a cultural phenomenon. A small New York Times piece reported on the wild scene at London Airport that Ed Sullivan had claimed to have witnessed in late October. The CBS and NBC nightly news programs quickly picked up on the excitement, albeit with jaundiced eyes. \u201cOne reason for the Beatles\u2019 popularity is that it is almost impossible to hear them,\u201d concluded NBC\u2019s Edwin Newman in the first of many network news reports on the band\u2019s soaring success.\n\nThe still dubious Capitol execs set a release date of Jan. 12, 1964, for \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d and initially planned to press only 5,000 copies. But the American public refused to wait. After watching a four-minute report on Beatlemania in Britain on \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d in early December, 15-year-old Marsha Albert of Silver Spring, Md., wrote a letter to her local radio disc jockey Carroll James of WWDC-AM pleading, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have this music in America?\u201d James had a stewardess friend working for the British Overseas Airways Corp. bring him a copy of the disc on her next flight to Dulles. He invited Marsha to introduce it on air, then put the record into heavy rotation every night on his evening program. He also distributed unauthorized tapes to disc jockeys in Chicago, St. Louis and Los Angeles. When attorneys for Capitol Records demanded that Carroll cease and desist, he ignored them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally succumbing to reality, Capitol moved the release date from Jan. 12 to Dec. 26 and frantically increased its order. Capitol also ordered 5 million \u201cThe Beatles Are Coming!\u201d stickers that it handed out all over the country and commanded its male office staff to wear Beatles wigs at work. But even Livingston later admitted that Capitol\u2019s last-minute spending spree was a minor factor in the Beatles\u2019 sudden success. By Jan. 10, \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d had sold a million copies and was No. 1 on the Cashbox charts. And Capitol\u2019s release of its \u201cMeet the Beatles\u201d album reached No. 1 by the time the band arrived in New York.\n\nPress coverage mushroomed, aided by some untraditional sources. Life magazine editor George Hunt commissioned a five-page spread in January after his teenage daughter made him stop the car so that she could listen to \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d uninterrupted by highway overpasses.\n\nFar more important was the positive verdict of Top 40 AM radio. New York\u2019s three main Top 40 stations \u2014 WABC, WMCA and their aggressive pint-size competitor, WINS, led by the incomparably frenzied \u201cMurray the K\u201d Kaufman \u2014 created urgent \u201cBeatles Watches,\u201d playing \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d and every other Beatles cut from the new album or from Vee-Jay reissues that they could get their hands on. When the Beatles left for New York, the three stations counted down the hours until the plane landed at JFK, broadcasting live updates from the besieged airport.\n\n\u201cWhat sells records is radio,\u201d Capitol executive Brown Meggs told the New York Times. \u201cThe Beatles got unbelievable radio play. There wasn\u2019t a single market in the country in which the airplay wasn\u2019t simply stupendous.\u201d\n\nThe two weeks in New York, Washington and Miami launched the Beatles to international fame. During the first three months of 1964, they were estimated to have accounted for 60 percent of all the records sold in the United States. They had 19 songs in the Top 40 that year and sold 25 million records.\n\nIt was the first American visit that had made it all seem inevitable, Paul McCartney wrote in his recent book, \u201c1964: Eyes of the Storm.\u201d \u201cBy the end of February 1964, after our visit to America, and three appearances on \u2018The Ed Sullivan Show,\u2019 we finally had to admit that we would not, as we had originally feared, just fizzle out as many groups do. We were in the vanguard of something more momentous, a revolution in the culture.\u201d\n\nAnd one of his favorite memories, McCartney once told the BBC, was of the man in charge: \u201cBrian in his polka-dot scarf at the back of the crowd, holding himself very proud of his boys.\u201d"}

Victims of elder financial exploitation lose $28.3 billion annually, according to a 2023 BankSafe report by AARP. If you haven\u2019t yet been approached by a scammer, you could face a scheme in the coming years. Sometimes family members, especially relatives caring for the elderly, are even the ones behind the attack.\n\nSome of the most common senior scams include:\n\n\n\nAI-powered scams.\n\nFuneral scams.\n\nTech support scams.\n\nGovernment imposter scams.\n\nGrandparent scams.\n\nInternet scams.\n\nInvestment scams.\n\nCheck fraud.\n\nReverse mortgage scams.\n\nCaregiver scams.\n\nSweepstakes scams.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how these elderly scams work and what you can do to avoid falling prey to an attack.\n\nAI-Powered Scams\n\nCrooks use advanced technology like artificial intelligence to write emails pretending to be someone or a company. They use tools to analyze patterns from a target\u2019s online presence and then develop a message that sounds real. They could also generate realistic-sounding voices that ask a victim for personal information. \u201cThis makes it easier to deceive individuals into sharing sensitive information or taking fraudulent actions, as the AI-generated email messages or calls may appear convincing and authentic,\u201d said Robert Siciliano, co-founder of Protect Now LLC, a Boston-based information technology and cybersecurity firm, in an email.\n\nFuneral Scams\n\nIf you place an obituary in a local publication after a loved one dies, a thief might contact you and insist that your deceased relative left behind a debt that needs to be paid. In another variation of this scam, the criminal might attend the funeral to gather information about you before asking for money to cover the debt. Someone pretending to be from the funeral home could call you and insist that there are extra charges that haven\u2019t been paid. For all these attempts, refuse to send money immediately and ask for written documentation of the expense.\n\nTech Support Scams\n\nA criminal might call or email you, pretending to be a support representative for a tech company. They could warn you that a virus or malware has damaged your computer. They may offer to update or fix your device. Once they begin work, they gain access to your personal files and information.\n\nGovernment Imposter Scams\n\nYou might receive phone calls from people pretending to be from the IRS or Social Security Administration that demand immediate payment of unpaid taxes or ask for personal information to continue your Social Security or Medicare benefits. The scammer could use a technique called spoofing, which makes it appear as if the incoming phone number is legitimate. The caller is likely to ask you for information or insist you make a payment, which might need to be in the form of a gift card.\n\n\u201cThe IRS and the SSA will never initiate contact with people through a phone call, so you can be sure that the person calling you is a scammer,\u201d said Steve Weisman, a lawyer and author of the scam blog Scamicide, in an email.\n\n\n\nGrandparent Scams\n\nIn this scenario, a person will pretend to be the grandchild of the person who answers the phone and ask for money. The caller might claim they are having an emergency, such as a car accident or problem with the law, and don\u2019t want anyone to find out. They sometimes ask you to send them money or gift cards.\n\n\u201cThe scammers often harvest the information they need to make the call appear legitimate from obituaries and social media,\u201d Weisman said. \u201cSetting up a code word for the grandchild to use in a real emergency is a good thing to do.\u201d\n\nInternet Scams\n\nIf you share information about yourself through social media, scammers could target you online. Internet scammers can find your personal information and use it to motivate you to provide funds or share more information.\n\n\u201cA client of mine got scammed out of a lot of money through Facebook,\u201d said Patrick Simasko, an elder law attorney at Simasko Law in Mount Clemens, Michigan, in an email. \u201cThe scammer pretended to be an officer in the army and claimed they needed money to get back from Afghanistan and visit their kids.\" The scammer could also pretend to be someone famous and invite you to connect personally with them. If you receive a message asking you to click a link, share details about your identity or make a payment, delete it.\n\nInvestment Scams\n\nA person claiming to be a financial advisor, real estate investor or wealth manager could contact you to discuss an exciting investment opportunity and promise big returns if you send them funds. These scams will take your money and not return anything to you. Before contributing to a new investment, consult a trusted financial advisor with appropriate credentials and avoid fast decisions.\n\nCheck Fraud\n\nThieves might steal a check from your mailbox or mail carrier. They could change the amount of the check and make it payable to someone else. Or they may take a digital picture of the check and alter it so they can make more deposits or develop other checks from the picture.\n\nReverse Mortgage Scams\n\nIf you own your own home, you could be contacted by an individual claiming that you could access some of the equity in your residence with a reverse mortgage. They may offer to appraise your home for a fee, give you an invalid home value and ask you to sign up with inaccurate loan documents. Don\u2019t respond to any requests that ask you to share details about your home or make a payment for a reverse home mortgage. If you\u2019re interested in getting a reverse mortgage, reach out to a reputable mortgage lender or advisor in your area and talk about your options.\n\n\n\nCaregiver Scams\n\nCaregivers may collect your data while in your home with you. If you\u2019re getting help from family members, they could have access to your personal information and take money from your accounts without you knowing about it. Your information could be used to open a new credit card and make purchases. To avoid falling victim, carefully research and vet any health aides or caregivers before they enter your home.\n\nSweepstakes Scams\n\nA fraudster could contact you to congratulate you for winning a lottery. They might send you a fake check, which may initially look real until it is rejected by the bank. That leaves you on the hook to pay fees or cover taxes. Jim White, an attorney and founder of J.C. White Law Group in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, has a client who was told that his wife, who has dementia, entered and won $15 million in an international sweepstakes, but then the client was asked to pay for fees."}

The prime minister thanked Biden for his support while highlighting his own experience of dealing with multiple U.S. administrations, describing a give-and-take approach to Israel's most important alliance.\n\n\u201cThere are those who say \u2018no\u2019 to everything, receiving applause at home, but they\u2019re also endangering vital interests,\u201d he said.\n\nBen-Gvir, along with other far-right figures, has called for \u201cvoluntary\u201d mass emigration of Palestinians from Gaza and for the return of Jewish settlements, which Israel dismantled when it withdrew troops from the territory in 2005. The Biden administration is opposed to any such scenario.\n\nThe dispute came at a sensitive time, as Netanyahu faces pressure from the U.S. and the international community to scale back the offensive even as Ben-Gvir and other key members of his governing coalition have threatened to bring down the government if they believe he is too soft on Hamas.\n\nIsrael is also involved in tense negotiations mediated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt aimed at freeing more than 100 captives held by Hamas in return for a cease-fire and the release of Palestinians jailed in Israel.\n\nThe war in Gaza has leveled vast swaths of the tiny besieged enclave, displaced 85% of its population and pushed a quarter of residents to starvation. The Health Ministry in Gaza said Sunday that 127 bodies have been brought to hospitals in the last 24 hours, bringing the overall death toll from nearly four months of fighting to 27,365.\n\nThe ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says most of those killed were women and children. The real toll is likely higher as the ministry says many casualties are buried under the rubble from airstrikes or cannot be reached by first responders.\n\nIn the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas and other militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. More than 100 captives, mostly women and children, were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nThousands of people gathered again in Tel Aviv late Saturday for protests criticizing Netanyahu's handling of the war and the plight of the hostages.\n\nFamily members of the hostages, with wide public support, are calling on Israel to reach an agreement with Hamas to bring them home. Hamas has said it won't release any more hostages until Israel ends its offensive. The militant group is also demanding the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nNetanyahu has publicly ruled out both demands. Hamas is expected to respond to the latest cease-fire offer in the coming days.\n\n___\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of the Israel-Hamas war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war"}

But the Democrat and his team are also using the visit to shore up support for the general election in November.\n\nBiden was arriving in Las Vegas on Sunday for appearances through Monday. He was flying in from California after events there Saturday.\n\nThe president last visited Nevada in December, when he highlight more than $8 billion in federal funding for passenger rail projects nationwide. On Sunday, Biden plans to meet with voters in the city's majority-Black Historic Westside and speak with community leaders about infrastructure investments.\n\nMichael Tyler, a spokesperson for Biden's reelection campaign, said the president will rally supporters to vote in Tuesday's primary and help build momentum for the fall, in what in shaping up to be a rematch of the 2020 contest against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nIn Tuesday's primary, Biden faces only token opposition from author Marianne Williamson and a handful of relatively unknown challengers. He won Nevada in November 2020 by fewer than 3 percentage points.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nThe state known largely for its casino and hospitality industries is synonymous with split-ticket, hard-to-predict results. It has a transient, working-class population and large Latino, Filipino and Chinese American and Black communities . There is a stark rural-urban divide, with more than 88% of Nevada's active registered voters \u2014 and much of its political power \u2014 in the two most populous counties, which include the Las Vegas and Reno metro areas.\n\nIn 2022, Democrats successfully defended their U.S. Senate seat and lost the governor\u2019s office. The six constitutional officers elected statewide are split evenly among Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe narrow victory of U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto helped Democrats party keep control of the Senate for the remainder of Biden\u2019s current term.\n\nWorking in Biden's favor this year is the vast Democratic operation built by the late U.S. Sen.

Voters are largely dissatisfied with the likely Biden-Trump rematch. A New York Times/Siena poll from November shows that Biden\u2019s approval rating is 36% in Nevada.\n\n\u201cI know from my reelection, the issues that matter to Nevadans are still those kitchen table issues,\u201d Cortez Masto said in an interview.\n\nBiden has built his reelection campaign around the theme that Trump presents a dire threat to U.S. democracy and its founding values. The president also has championed the defense of abortion rights, recently holding his first big campaign rally, in Virginia, where the issue energized Democrats who won control of the state\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nBiden also promotes his handling of the economy, arguing that his policies have created millions of jobs, combated climate change and improved American competitiveness overseas. But polls show that many voters aren\u2019t giving his administration credit.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee last week announced a six-figure ad buy in Nevada and South Carolina, where Biden won the leadoff primary Saturday. The ads are meant to boost enthusiasm among Black, Asian and Latino voters statewide, including radio, television and digital ads in Spanish, Chinese and Tagalog, and a billboard in Las Vegas\u2019 Chinatown.\n\nAs early voting began last weekend in Nevada, Trump asserted without evidence during a campaign rally in Las Vegas that he was the victim of the Biden administration's weaponizing law enforcement against him. Trump has been indicted four times and faces 91 felonies.\n\nAbout a mile away, Harris warned union leaders at a get-out-the-vote rally that Trump \"made clear his fight is not for the people.

The administration has also made clear through background media briefings its concern that Netanyahu has no postwar plan for Gaza\u2019s governance.\n\nAnd following the preliminary order issued by the International Court of Justice in the genocide case against Israel this past weekend, White House commentary made clear the court\u2019s orders aligned with U.S. policy. Specifically, the court said Israel must take all possible steps to minimise civilian harm and increase the flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza.\n\n\n\nWith criticism of Israel mounting on the global stage, the Biden administration has inserted the United States\u2019 long-standing support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIn response, Netanyahu has thrown down the gauntlet \u2013 flatly rejecting the creation of a separate Palestinian state. He posted on X: \u201cI will not compromise on full Israeli security control over the entire area in the west of Jordan \u2013 and this is contrary to a Palestinian state\u201d.\n\nButting heads with U.S. presidents\n\nThis rift between the two leaders should not be a surprise. Netanyahu is Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and has the self-belief that goes with 16 years in office.\n\nThis is not the first time he has butted heads with a U.S. president. In particular, he had a poisonous relationship with Barack Obama, notably visiting Washington to address a joint sitting of Congress in 2015 without bothering to call on the president \u2013 an extraordinary breach of protocol.\n\nDespite the fact the Oslo Accords of 1993 and 1995, signed by former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, laid down a pathway to the creation of a Palestinian state, Netanyahu has never hidden his opposition to the concept.\n\nIn a recently published profile of Netanyahu in the New Yorker, David Remnick describes how the Israeli leader made a speech in 2009 in which he \u201cconveyed a wary and highly conditional openness to a Palestinian state\u201d. The conditions included:\n\n\n\nPalestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state\n\nno return of Palestinian refugees outside Israel\n\nthe demilitarisation of a future Palestinian state\n\nand Jerusalem remaining the united capital of Israel.\n\nNone of these was likely to be acceptable to Palestinians.\n\nRemnick comments the speech was a tactical move, with a larger goal in mind. He quotes the reaction of then-U.S. ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk:\n\nWe met a day or two after the speech. [Netanyahu] was all puffed up, and he said to me, \u2018All right, I said it, now can we get back to dealing with Iran?\u2018\n\nIs Biden or Netanyahu right?\n\nThis leads to the current \u2013 and more important \u2013 question: who is right about the future viability of a two-state solution, Biden or Netanyahu?\n\nPutting aside questions of equity and morality, analysis of the evidence suggests the answer is Netanyahu.\n\nThe simple fact is the number of Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank (including East Jerusalem) \u2013 now about 700,000, who live alongside three million Palestinians \u2013 means there is not much space left for a Palestinian state.\n\nThat gap is narrowing, with population growth higher among settlers than Palestinians. Ultra-Orthodox Jews, who comprise one-third of the settlers, have a fertility rate in Israel of 6.5 live births per woman. The current fertility rate among Palestinians is around 3.8 births per woman. If this trend continues, by mid-century, the Israeli-Palestinian population in the West Bank could be equal.\n\nThe only way space could be made for another state would be if the government were to dismantle the settlements and direct the settlers to live within the borders that existed before Israel seized the West Bank in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\nDespite the fact the settlements are illegal under international law \u2013 they violate the Fourth Geneva Convention \u2013 no Israeli government is likely to try to remove them for fear of violent domestic consequences. Some in Netanyahu\u2019s government are already talking about Israel annexing the West Bank, in the way it annexed East Jerusalem in 1980.\n\nTalk of land swaps usually ends with potential offers of land for Palestinians in the barely habitable Negev desert. The major Jewish settlement blocks in the West Bank, by contrast, are in prime real estate.\n\nThen there is the question of Gaza, which is barely large enough to accommodate its current population of 2.3 million. With unemployment there at nearly 50%, it is a breeding ground for radicalism, as the Hamas attack in October demonstrated.\n\n\n\nMost Israelis agree with Netanyahu\n\nThe other factor is that Netanyahu\u2019s rejection of a Palestinian state reflects the current views of most Israelis.\n\nPolling by the Pew Research Center in March and April 2023 \u2013 well before the Hamas attack \u2013 showed only 35% of Israelis (including both Jewish and Arab respondents) thought \u201ca way could be found for Israel and an independent Palestinian state to coexist peacefully\u201d. That was down nine percentage points from 2017 and 15 points from 2013.\n\nAmong Jewish Israelis, those who agreed with the statement dropped from 46% in 2013 to 32% last year. The decline was even sharper among Arab Israelis, who had been more optimistic in 2013, with 74% thinking peaceful coexistence was possible. By 2023, the proportion was just 41%.\n\nThe extent to which Netanyahu, in office throughout this period, might have influenced these declines is difficult to measure. But considering the current level of hatred and distrust between Israelis and Palestinians, it\u2019s difficult to envisage any potential replacement for Netanyahu taking a different line on a Palestinian state.\n\nThat reality is reinforced by the Orthodox Jewish demographics noted above. Orthodox Jews tend to vote for conservative religious parties, which means growing numbers of Orthodox voters favour the formation of right-wing governments (given Israel\u2019s strict proportional representation voting system). Netanyahu currently leads an extremist right-wing government, and it\u2019s unlikely to be the last.\n\nThat means talk of a two-state solution by Western governments is simply kicking the can down the road. It\u2019s not going to happen. Israelis respect the U.S. and value the materiel and diplomatic support provided by U.S. presidential administrations, but they won\u2019t be ordered about by them.\n\nAnd there could be a change in leadership in the U.S. this year, too. The leading Republican candidate, Donald Trump, had a reputation as the most pro-Israel U.S. leader since Harry Truman when he was in office. So, if Trump wins the election and Netanyahu is still in office next year, there will be little head-butting at all.\n\nIan Parmeter, Research Scholar, Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies, Australian National University"}

The Houthis gave no assessment of the damage but the U.S. described hitting underground missile arsenals, launch sites and helicopters used by the rebels.\n\n\u201cThese attacks will not discourage Yemeni forces and the nation from maintaining their support for Palestinians in the face of the Zionist occupation and crimes,\u201d Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree said. \u201cThe aggressors\u2019 airstrikes will not go unanswered.\u201d\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned the Houthis after the strikes that \u201cthey will continue to bear further consequences if they do not end their illegal attacks on international shipping and naval vessels.\u201d That message was echoed by British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who said: \u201cThe Houthi attacks must stop.\u201d\n\nThe Behshad and Saviz are registered as commercial cargo ships with a Tehran-based company the U.S. Treasury has sanctioned as a front for the state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines. The Saviz, then later the Behshad, have loitered for years in the Red Sea off Yemen, suspected of serving as spy positions for Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\n\nIn 2017, Saudi Arabia described the Saviz as a maritime base and weapons transshipment point for the Guard, staffed by men in military fatigues. Footage aired by Saudi-owned television channels showed the vessel armed with what appeared to be a covered machine gun bolted to the ship\u2019s deck.\n\nIn the video statement Sunday by the Iran's regular army, a narrator for the first time describes the vessels as \u201cfloating armories.\" The narrator describes the Behshad as aiding an Iranian mission to \u201ccounteract piracy in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\u201d However, Iran is not publicly known to have taken part in any of the recent campaigns against rising Somali piracy in the region off the back of the Houthi attacks.\n\nJust before the new campaign of U.S. airstrikes began, the Behshad traveled south into the Gulf of Aden. It's now docked in Djibouti in East Africa just off the coast from a Chinese military base in the country.\n\nThe statement ends with a warning overlaid with a montage of footage of U.S. warships and an American flag.\n\n\u201cThose engaging in terrorist activities against Behshad or similar vessels jeopardize international maritime routes, security and assume global responsibility for potential future international risks,\u201d the video said.\n\nThe U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the threat.\n\nThe Saviz, which is now in the Indian Ocean near where the U.S. alleges Iranian drone attacks recently have targeted shipping, has come under attack before. In 2021, a likely limpet mine explosion blew a hole through the hull of the Saviz, forcing Iran to bring the ship home. That attack, suspected to have been carried out by Israel, is part of a wider shadow war between Tehran and Israel after the collapse of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n___\n\nBaldor and Copp reported from Washington.

Judges Want to Set the Record Straight", "domain": "usnews.com", "pub_token": "CAAqJAgKIh5DQklTRUFnTWFnd0tDblZ6Ym1WM2N5NWpiMjBvQUFQAQ", "text": "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth condemned the depiction by Trump and Republican allies of Jan. 6 defendants as \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d and \u201chostages.\" Lamberth also denounced attempts to undermine the legitimacy of the justice system for punishing rioters who broke the law when they invaded the Capitol.\n\n\u201cIn my 37 years on the bench, I cannot recall a time when such meritless justifications of criminal activity have gone mainstream,\u201d Lamberth, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, wrote in a recent ruling. The judge added he \u201cfears that such destructive, misguided rhetoric could presage further danger to our country.\u201d\n\nAs Trump floats potential pardons for rioters if he returns to the White House, judges overseeing the more than 1,200 Jan. 6 criminal cases in Washington's federal court are using their platform to try to set the record straight concerning distortions about an attack that was broadcast live on television. A growing number of defendants appear to be embracing rhetoric spread by Trump, giving defiant speeches in court, repeating his false election claims and portraying themselves as patriots.\n\nDuring a recent court hearing, Proud Boys member Marc Bru repeatedly insulted and interrupted the judge, who ultimately sentenced him to six years in prison. \u201cYou can give me 100 years and I\u2019d do it all over again,\u201d Bru said.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nAt least two other rioters shouted \u201cTrump won!\u201d in court after receiving their punishment.\n\nSome people charged in the riot are pinning their hopes on a Trump victory in November.\n\nRachel Marie Powell, a Pennsylvania woman who was sentenced to nearly five years in prison for smashing a Capitol window, told a CNN reporter that the 2024 presidential election is \u201clike life or death\u201d for her. She said she believes she will get out of prison if Trump is elected.\n\nThe rhetoric resonates with the strangers who donate money to Jan. 6 defendant's online campaigns, but it isn\u2019t earning them any sympathy from the judges. Judges appointed by presidents from both political parties have described the riot as an affront to democracy and they repeatedly have admonished defendants for not showing true remorse or casting themselves as victims.\n\nOver more than three years, judges have watched hours of video showing members of the mob violently shoving past overwhelmed officers, shattering windows, attacking police with things such as flagpoles and pepper spray and threatening violence against lawmakers. In court hearings, officers have described being beaten, threatened and scared for their lives as they tried to defend the Capitol.\n\nBefore sentencing a Kentucky man, who already had a long criminal record, to 14 years in prison for attacking police with pepper spray and a chair, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta admonished the man for propagating \u201cthe lie that what's happening here in Washington, D.C., is unfair and unjust.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a political prisoner,\" Mehta, who was nominated by President Barack Obama told Peter Schwartz. \"You\u2019re not Alexei Navalny,\u201d the judge said referring to the imprisoned Russian opposition leader. \u201cYou're not somebody who is standing up against injustice, who's fighting against an autocratic regime. ... You're somebody who decided to take the day into his own hands, much in the same way that you have used your hands against others for much of your life.\u201d\n\nLamberth\u2019s scathing remarks came in the case of James Little, a North Carolina man who was not accused of any violence or destruction during the riot and pleaded guilty only to a misdemeanor offense. Lamberth didn\u2019t name the people responsible for what the judge called \u201cshameless\u201d attempts to rewrite history. But Trump has closely aligned himself with rioters during his presidential campaign. He has described them as \u201chostages,\u201d called for their release from jail and pledged to pardon a large portion of them if he wins the White House in November.\n\nRoughly 750 people charged with federal crimes in the riot have pleaded guilty and more than 100 others have been convicted at trial. Many rioters were charged only with misdemeanor offenses akin to trespassing while others face serious felonies such as assault or seditious conspiracy. Of those who have been sentenced, roughly two-thirds have received some time behind bars, with terms ranging from a few days of intermittent confinement to 22 years in prison, according to data compiled by The Associated Press.\n\nLamberth had originally sentenced Little in 2022 to 60 days behind bars, followed by three years of probation. But Washington\u2019s federal appeals court sided with Little on appeal, ruling he could not be sentenced to both prison time and probation. When Little\u2019s case returned to Lamberth\u2019s court, the judge resentenced him to 150 days \u2014 with credit for time already served in jail and on probation \u2014 citing the man\u2019s claims of persecution and efforts to downplay the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\u201cLittle cannot bring himself to admit that he did the wrong thing, although he came close today,\u201d Judge Lamberth wrote. \u201cSo it is up to the court to tell the public the truth: Mr. Little\u2019s actions, and the actions of others who broke the law on Jan. 6, were wrong. The court does not expect its remarks to fully stem the tide of falsehoods. But I hope a little truth will go a long way.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Little declined to comment on Lamberth's remarks.\n\nIn other cases, judges have said their sentence must send a message when rioters have promoted the notion that they are being unfairly prosecuted for their political views. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper told Richard \u201cBigo\u201d Barnett, the Arkansas man who propped his feet on a desk in then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office in a widely circulated photo, that he seemed to enjoy the notoriety of becoming one of the faces of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\u201cYou have made yourself one of the faces of J6 not just through that photo but using your platform and your notoriety to peddle the misconception that you and other J6ers are somehow political prisoners who are being persecuted for your beliefs as opposed to your conduct on Jan. 6,\u201d Cooper, an Obama appointee, told Barnett before sentencing him to more than four years in prison.\n\n\u201cSo to all those folks that follow Bigo, they need to know that the actions of Jan. 6 cannot be repeated without some serious repercussions,\" the judge said.\n\n____\n\nRicher reported from Boston."}

It has previously denied targeting or abusing civilians and accuses Hamas of using hospitals for military operations, which Hamas denies.\n\n\"The torture was very severe in Israeli prison. I am a doctor. My weight was 87 kilograms. I lost, in 45 days, more than 25 kilograms. I lost my balance. I lost focus. I lost all feeling,\" he said.\n\n\"However you describe the suffering and the insults in prison you can never know the reality unless you lived through it,\" he added.\n\nMaarouf said he has no idea where he was detained as he was blindfolded throughout his detention, and he was not sure if he was held inside or outside Gaza. He was dropped at the Kerem Shalom crossing and was picked up by the Red Cross.\n\nMaarouf's arrest was the last moment he had news of his family, and he still does not know if they survived the onslaught as Israeli forces advanced into Gaza City under an intense artillery barrage.\n\nThe war began when Hamas militants rampaged across the border into Israeli towns on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking away 240 hostages.\n\nIsrael's military assault began the same day with an intense bombardment, followed later in October by a ground assault that has continued for months. Health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say Israel's offensive has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians.\n\nAs well as hospitals, Israel has said Hamas routinely uses other medical facilities including ambulances for military operations, and it has shown evidence of tunnels and some weapons at some facilities.\n\nNO INFORMATION\n\nMaarouf held back tears as he described his last phone conversation with his daughter as the Israeli soldiers called on loudspeakers for all doctors and medical staff to leave the hospital building.\n\nShe had been in the family home in Gaza City, one of his five children who were all there with his wife and 15 to 20 other relatives.\n\n\"Dad the bombing has reached us. What do we do?\" she said to him. He replied that if he told her to stay and they were killed, or if he told her to leave and they were killed it would be torture for him.\n\n\"If you want to leave then leave. If you want to stay then stay. I'm in the same trench with you and I'm going now to the Israeli soldiers without knowing my fate,\" he remembered telling her.\n\n\"From that moment until today I have no information about my children or my wife,\" he said, crying.\n\nThe devastation in Gaza has scattered families and cut off communications, making it hard for people to reach many areas physically and unable to contact each other by phone, with most telecom networks down.\n\nMaarouf believes he was one of more than 100 prisoners being held in the same place. \"Each one of us was wishing for death... wishing to die from the severity of the suffering,\" he said.\n\nHe said being told to try to sleep lying on pebbles was the worst part of his experience.\n\n\"I am a paediatrician working for 23 years in this field. I did not commit any humanitarian crime. My weapon is my pen, my notebook and my stethoscope. I didn't leave the place. I was treating children inside hospitals,\" he said.\n\n\"When we were called to where the tanks were I thought we'd be there a few hours and leave. I thought if they took me and my colleagues they would treat us well because we are doctors and did not commit any crime,\" he said.\n\nBack in Gaza, he is working again in a children's ward, a stethoscope around his neck, the sound of crying infants and the concerned whispers of parents around him once more.\n\n(Reporting by Bassam Masoud and Ibraheem Abu Mustafa in Rafah and Henriette Chacar in Jerusalem; Writing by Angus McDowall; Editing by Hugh Lawson)"}

(AP) \u2014 When he left the White House, Donald Trump was a pariah.\n\nAfter years of bending Washington to his will with a single tweet, Trump was, at least for a moment, diminished. He was a one-term Republican president rejected by voters and then shunned by large swaths of his party after his refusal to accept his 2020 election defeat culminated in an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol that sent lawmakers running for their lives.\n\nSome members of his Cabinet had discussed invoking the 25th Amendment, seeing him unfit to remain in office. He was banned from social media and became the first president to be impeached twice. And when he departed Washington, the nation's capital was still reeling from his supporters' violence and resembled a security fortress with boarded-up storefronts and military vehicles in the streets.\n\nThree years later, Trump is on the cusp of a stunning turnaround. With commanding victories in the first two 2024 nominating contests and wide polling leads in the states ahead, Trump is fast closing in on the Republican nomination. Already, he is the first nonincumbent Republican to win the party's contests in both Iowa and New Hampshire, and he had the largest victory margin in Iowa caucus history. His standing is expected to improve this coming week with a win in Nevada\u2019s Republican caucuses, which his last major GOP rival, Nikki Haley, will skip in favor of a competing primary, which awards no delegates.\n\nTrump did all this while facing 91 felony charges that range from mishandling highly classified documents and conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, to paying off a porn star during his 2016 campaign. Trump is also facing a civil fraud case in New York that threatens his control of much of his business empire and was recently ordered to pay $83.3 million for defaming a woman he was previously found liable for sexually abusing.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nThe story of how Trump became his party's likely nominee for a third straight presidential election is a reminder that there was an opening \u2014 however brief \u2014 when the GOP could have moved beyond him but didn't. It shows how little was learned from 2016, as his critics once again failed to coalesce around a single alternative. And it demonstrates \u2014 with long-standing implications for American democracy \u2014 how Trump and his campaign seized on his unprecedented legal challenges, turning what should have been an insurmountable obstacle into a winning strategy.\n\n\u201cI think everybody got in the race thinking the Trump fever would break,\" said longtime Republican strategist Chip Saltsman, who chaired the campaign of one of Trump's rivals. \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t break. It got hotter.\u201d\n\nA DERAILMENT\n\nTrump campaign aides say their first sign of momentum was not a legal victory or a gaffe by a rival, but a trip to East Palestine, Ohio, in February 2023.\n\nFollowing a lackluster 2024 campaign announcement a few months earlier and slow start, the former president received a rousing welcome from residents demanding answers after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed, leading to evacuations and fears of air and water contamination. Trump was briefed by local officials, blasted the federal response as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d and stopped by a local McDonald\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt kind of reminded people what it was they liked about Trump to begin with,\u201d said senior campaign adviser Chris LaCivita. Trump, whose surprise 2016 victory had been fueled by angry white working-class voters who felt the government had failed them, was again casting himself as the outsider fighting big business and Washington.\n\nBiden didn't visit at the time, helping Trump draw a contrast. He has accepted an invitation from East Palestine's mayor to finally visit this month.\n\nTHE CHARGES START ROLLING IN\n\nIf the derailment offered Republican voters a reminder of why they liked Trump, a series of criminal charges would reinforce their devotion to him.\n\nRalph Reed, chair of the influential Faith & Freedom Coalition and a presidential campaign veteran, happened to be at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida for a charity breakfast the morning Trump become the first former U.S. president to be indicted.\n\n\u201cIt was like a bomb going off,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could feel the ground shift immediately.\n\nBut instead of calls for Trump to suspend his campaign, the response from Republicans was one of indignation. Trump portrayed himself as the victim of a politicized criminal justice system bent on damaging his reelection chances. Almost immediately, Republicans sprung to his defense.\n\nHis campaign was flooded with small-dollar donations and raised $15.4 million in just two weeks. (When Trump was later booked on racketeering charges in Georgia and became the first former president to have his mug shot taken, the campaign brought in a record $4.18 million that day.) Trump's allied super political action committee, which had struggled to raise money, saw a similar surge in contributions as Trump's poll numbers began to rise.\n\nFor Republican voters, the mounting charges confirmed Trump's loudly stated grievances that the system was rigged against him, driving many who had been considering other candidates to rally around him.\n\nIt was \u201ca reminder that, at the end of the day, they wear a red jersey, and Joe Biden and his henchmen wear a blue jersey,\u201d said Trump senior campaign adviser Jason Miller.\n\nMichael Telesca, a former schoolteacher from Hickory, North Carolina, who left his job to hike the Appalachian Trail, said last fall that the indictments and other attacks against Trump had transformed him from an ordinary Trump voter into an \u201cardent\" supporter.\n\nWhile he liked Trump's policies, \u201cI am more fighting against the system that is attacking him relentlessly. ... There\u2019s a good portion of Republicans who say it\u2019s time for someone else. Here\u2019s the problem: If that happens, you\u2019ve allowed the system to win.\u201d\n\nThe impact was immediately felt across rival campaigns, whose candidates were put in the awkward position of having to defend their chief opponent in order to avoid siding with Democratic prosecutors or Biden\u2019s Justice Department. As the indictments continued to roll in, Trump further dominated the media coverage, denying his competitors much-needed attention.\n\n\u201cIt made him a victim, and nobody\u2019s better at playing the victim than Donald Trump,\" Reed said.\n\nTrump turned his subsequent bookings and court appearances into spectacles that became fundamental to his campaign message. Indeed, some weeks, he voluntarily spent more time in the courtroom than in early voting states. Trump's team credits his decision to confront the charges head-on with helping ease voters' concerns about his electability.\n\n\u201cIt was from that point on that it essentially had become impossible to beat Donald Trump in the Republican Party primary,\u201d LaCivita said.\n\nDESANTIS-IN-WAITING ... AND WAITING\n\nFor months, Trump's stiffest competition for the GOP nomination appeared to be the governor of Florida.\n\nFresh off a landslide reelection victory in November 2022, Ron DeSantis was a rising conservative star and one of his party's only bright spots in a bruising midterm election cycle. Some polls showed voters preferred him to Trump, who was being blamed for backing extreme candidates who cost Republicans winnable seats.\n\nBut DeSantis chose to wait until May 2023 to launch his campaign, giving the former president and his allies a six-month head start.\n\nTrump\u2019s senior advisers urged him not to attack DeSantis until later in the race. But Trump, rebuffing their guidance, came out with his derisive \u201cDeSanctimonious\u201d before the midterm vote. The super PAC ads began last March.\n\n\u201cWe made a big bet,\u201d said MAGA Inc. CEO Taylor Budowich. \u201cWe decided to go after him early and define him before he could define himself.\u201d That included pouring millions into ads hitting DeSantis for previously backing Social Security cuts.\n\nFor some top Trump aides, beating DeSantis was personal. A handful had worked for the governor previously, and some were burned by his actions. Even those who left on good terms were intimately familiar with his strengths and weaknesses and what would make him tick.\n\nTo contrast DeSantis\u2019 awkward interactions with voters, Trump's campaign began planning photo ops at pizza joints and diners that showcased the former president interacting with his fans.\n\nRidicule was also part of the strategy, including a memorable \u201cpudding fingers\u201d MAGA Inc. ad that highlighted unsavory reporting on DeSantis' eating habits, and accusations DeSantis wore lifts in his boots.\n\nTo blunt the governor's momentum, the super PAC also aired attack ads on networks such as CNN, trying to target more moderate voters considering the governor.\n\n\u201cMAGA Inc\u2019s national buys were targeted at national polls because that was the barometer of strength at that time \u2014 we were able to simultaneously drive down his standing in primary and general election polling,\u201d Budowich said.\n\nInterviews with voters suggested those who had been open to a Trump alternative ultimately realized they preferred the original better.\n\n\u201cDeSantis, he can talk from here all day long,\u201d said Gary Leffler, a general contractor from West Des Moines, Iowa, as he pointed to his head. \u201cFact-wise, policy-wise, all this other stuff, he\u2019s pretty solid.\u201d\n\nBut Trump, Leffler added as he moved his fist to his heart, \u201ctalks from here. And that\u2019s a gear that DeSantis doesn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nMCCARTHY'S PILGRIMAGE TO MAR-A-LAGO\n\nRival campaign aides said Trump\u2019s road to the 2024 GOP nomination began just three weeks after the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. That was when Kevin McCarthy, who was the Republican leader of the U.S. House, traveled to Mar-a-Lago and posed for a widely shared photo next to a grinning Trump at the moment that Trump was at his weakest.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, an outspoken GOP critic of Trump, would later write in her book that McCarthy told her he had been summoned because Trump was depressed and not eating. (Trump said he was actually angry and \u201ceating too much.\")\n\nBut the normalizing episode signaled the party was not ready to give up on Trump.\n\n\u201cI thought it was the kiss of death for McCarthy, for the party and for the country,\u201d said Mike DuHaime, a senior adviser to the 2024 presidential campaign of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another Trump critic. \u201cIt breathed new life into Trump.\u201d\n\nRISKY BETS THAT PAID OFF\n\nFrom the start, Trump acted like the front-runner, declining invitations to multicandidate events and refusing to debate.\n\nTrump's absence blunted viewers' interest and left his lower-polling rivals fighting one another instead of him.\n\n\u201cYou've got to give credit to the Trump campaign,\u201d said Saltsman, who chaired the 2024 campaign of Mike Pence, who was Trump's vice president. \u201cThey treated it like they were an incumbent running for reelection.\"\n\nMiller, the Trump adviser, said steering clear of the debates was part of a broader effort to focus on Biden. Trump went after the Democrat over the economy, the border and wars in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nAt the same time, Trump's team worked aggressively behind the scenes to line up endorsements that would signal his continued dominance of the party and the strength of his new campaign. It has been widely praised as far more disciplined and professional than past efforts that were plagued by infighting.\n\nTrump invested \u201chundreds and hundreds of hours\" in relationship development, said Brian Jack, a senior campaign aide who has led the outreach. Trump worked the phones, hosted dinners and invited officials to ride aboard his private plane.\n\nHe also astutely weaponized the endorsements. In April, as DeSantis was making a much-publicized trip to Washington before his expected campaign announcement, Trump\u2019s team released a set of new endorsements from Florida politicians. Later, Trump taunted Haley, an ex-South Carolina governor and his U.N. ambassador, before the New Hampshire primary by flying in a group of South Carolina officials who were backing his candidacy.\n\nMarc Short, a top adviser to Pence's campaign, also pointed to Trump's more than 200 midterm endorsements. While Trump had mixed success that November, he proved a powerful kingmaker in GOP primary races that often devolved into fealty contests.\n\n\u201cEveryone saw the candidates he endorsed in their primaries won their primaries, signaling to others that, \u2018I better show my allegiance to Trump or I\u2019m going to be in trouble,'\" Short said.\n\nBeyond the endorsements, Trump's team also worked closely with state parties as they set delegate allocation rules, encouraging winner-take-all contests and other changes that would ultimately benefit a front-runner.\n\n\u201cWe were closing doors to our opponents in the Republican nomination seven months ago before they even realized that was happening,\" LaCivita said.\n\nTHE LOYALTY FACTOR\n\nAs the first nominating contests neared, Trump's team worked to harness the dedication of his loyal supporters. The move paid off particularly well in Iowa, where historically frigid temperatures cut expected caucus attendance in half.\n\nTrump\u2019s team rewarded its volunteers with perks such as VIP tickets to his rallies and gold-embroidered hats. Some, like John Goodrich, who lives in suburban Des Moines and knocked on 300 doors, received personal phone calls to thank them for their efforts.\n\n\u201cI was just thrilled,\" Goodrich said of the caucus day call. Trump \u201cwas very thankful for the help\" and asked him about his family and his expectations for the night. \u201cIt just made me feel good that he would turn to just someone who was more or less a door-to-door salesman for him to get my opinion.\"\n\nIn both Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump's team also marveled at how DeSantis and Haley spent their time and money going after each other, largely sparing him from attacks.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report."}

The rest, he said, were mostly in the southern Gaza Strip - including Rafah, on the enclave's Egyptian border.\n\n\"We'll take care of them, too,\" he said, according to a statement from his office. Hamas does not publish its losses.\n\nWar in Israel and Gaza View All 194 Images\n\nThe prospect of a push into Rafah has piled pressure on the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians who have fled their homes elsewhere and are sheltering there. It also worries Cairo, which has said it will not admit any influx of Palestinian refugees in what it describes a bid to prevent any permanent dispossession.\n\nAn Israeli official told Reuters, however, that the military would coordinate with Egypt, and seek ways of evacuating most of the displaced people northward, ahead of any Rafah ground sweep.\n\nPalestinians reported Israeli tank shelling and air strikes there, including one that killed two girls in a house.\n\nAs mourners bade farewell to the dead children, a relative, Mohammed Kaloub, said the air strike hit a room full of women and children in Rafah's al-Salam neighborhood.\n\n\"There is no safe place in Gaza, from the wire fence to the wire fence (borders from north to south), there is no safe place,\" he told Reuters.\n\nPalestinian health officials said eight people were killed in separate Israeli air strikes on Deir Al-Balah areas in the central Gaza Strip. Deir Al-Balah is the second city in the enclave where Israel has not yet deployed tanks.\n\nAfter conducting partial pullouts from Gaza City in the past few weeks that enabled some residents to return and pick through the rubble, Israeli forces have been mounting incursions. Netanyahu described these on Sunday as \"mopping-up operations\".\n\nBefore dawn on Sunday, air strikes destroyed several multi-storey buildings, including an Egyptian-funded housing project, residents said. The military said it killed seven Hamas gunmen in northern Gaza and seized weaponry. Israel's Army Radio said troops in the area were trying to penetrate two Hamas bunkers, a mission it said could take two weeks amid clashes at the sites.\n\n\"Gaza City is being wiped out,\" one resident who asked not to be named told Reuters. \"The (Israeli) pull-out was a ruse.\"\n\n'NEUTRALISING' TUNNELS\n\nIn Khan Younis, overnight Israeli shelling killed three Palestinians, medics said. Residents reported street fighting raging in western and southern areas of the city, where Israel said a soldier was killed in a Palestinian attack on Saturday.\n\nTroops in Khan Younis seized a Hamas compound and killed several gunmen, the military said. Netanyahu said Israeli forces in the city were \"neutralising\" Hamas tunnels that run throughout Gaza, enabling gunmen to hole up and launch ambushes.\n\n\"This demands more time yet,\" he told his ministers.\n\nGaza health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians in their tallies, said on Sunday more than 27,300 Palestinians have been confirmed killed since the war began. They say that 70% of those killed have been women and children. Thousands more are feared lost amid the ruins.\n\nIsrael says it has killed some 10,000 gunmen in its campaign to annihilate Hamas after the Oct. 7 attack by the group, which is sworn to Israel's destruction. In the rampage, 1,200 people were killed and 253 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nMore than 130 hostages are still in Gaza, and their possible release by Hamas is among issues under discussion in Egyptian- and Qatari-mediated negotiations, that are backed by the United States, to secure a truce.\n\nHamas has demanded an end to the war. Israel rules that out but is open to a temporary truce.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi hosted French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne in a meeting on Sunday that Sisi's office said emphasized Egypt's collaborative efforts to establish a ceasefire and deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Doha and Dan Williams in Jerusalem, Tala Ramadan in DubaiEditing by Frances Kerry)"}

The detentions lead to a collapse in nationwide murder rates and transformed the poor Central American nation that was once among the world's most dangerous.\n\nPolls show most voters now appear set to reward Bukele for decimating the crime groups that made life intolerable for El Salvador's 6.3 million people and fueled waves of migration to the U.S.\n\n\"I would vote for Bukele because of the work he has done so far,\" said Juan Carlos Rosales, 44, a systems engineer in the capital San Salvador. \"The improvement in security is palpable.\"\n\nA firebrand politician who often spars with foreign leaders and foes on social media, Bukele came to power in 2019 trouncing El Salvador's traditional parties with a vow to eliminate gang violence and rejuvenate the country's stagnant economy.\n\nSince then, he has used his New Ideas party's supermajority in the legislative assembly to reshape courts and institutions, solidifying his grip on key parts of the government. He also championed the introduction of Bitcoin as a legal tender, drawing criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nBukele is set to be first Salvadoran president in more than 100 years to be re-elected. Last year, El Salvador's Supreme Electoral Tribunal permitted him to run for a second term even though the country's constitution prohibits it. Opponents voiced fears Bukele would seek to rule for life, following President Daniel Ortega from next-door Nicaragua.\n\nRights groups have warned El Salvador's democracy is under attack. Bukele has largely dismissed those concerns, at one point changing his profile on X, the social media platform, to say: \"World's coolest dictator\".\n\nSalvadorans seem unfazed, with polls showing about 80% of them support him.\n\n\"There is still a huge amount to do but, step by step, we will resolve entire decades of looting and neglect,\" Bukele wrote on X this week.\n\nFive other presidential candidates are contesting the elections, including politicians from the former leftist guerrilla Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front (FMLN) and the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), which between them governed for 30 years until 2019.\n\nOnce re-elected, Bukele's biggest challenge is likely to be a sputtering economy, Central America's slowest growing during his time in power. More than a quarter of Salvadorans live in poverty.\n\nExtreme poverty has doubled and private investment has tumbled. There has not been much momentum on Bukele's highly publicized plans for Bitcoin City, a tax-free crypto haven powered by geothermal energy from a volcano.\n\nThe IMF, which is negotiating a $1.3 billion bailout with El Salvador, in late 2023 described the country's fiscal situation as \"fragile\".\n\n(Reporting by Nelson Renteria and Diego Ore; Writing by Drazen Jorgic and David Gregorio)"}

This advert, promoted on Instagram and other social media platforms, is just one of many campaigns created by the California-based company BetterHelp, which offers to connect users with online therapists.\n\nThe need for sophisticated digital alternatives to conventional face-to-face therapy has been well established in recent years. If we go by the latest data for NHS talking therapy services, 1.76 million people were referred for treatment in 2022-23, while 1.22 million actually started working with a therapist in person.\n\nWhile companies like BetterHelp are hoping to address some of the barriers that prevent people from seeking therapy, such as a dearth of trained practitioners in their area, or finding a therapist they can relate to, there is a concerning side to many of these platforms. Namely, what happens to the considerable amounts of deeply sensitive data they gather in the process? Moves are now under way in the UK to look at regulating these apps, and awareness of potential harm is growing.\n\nLast year, the US Federal Trade Commission handed BetterHelp a $7.8m (\u00a36.1m) fine after the agency found that it had deceived consumers and shared sensitive data with third parties for advertising purposes, despite promising to keep such information private. BetterHelp representatives did not respond to a request for comment from the Observer.\n\nView image in fullscreen The number of people seeking help with their mental health online grew rapidly during the pandemic. Photograph: Alberto Case/Getty Images\n\nInstead of being an isolated exception, research suggests that such privacy violations are too common within the vast industry of mental health apps, which includes virtual therapy services, mood trackers, mental fitness coaches, digitised forms of cognitive behavioural therapy and chatbots.\n\nIndependent watchdogs such as the Mozilla Foundation, a global nonprofit that attempts to police the internet for bad actors, have identified platforms exploiting opaque regulatory grey areas to either share or sell sensitive personal information. When the foundation surveyed 32 leading mental health apps for a report last year, it found that 19 of them were failing to protect user privacy and security. \u201cWe found that too often, your personal, private mental health struggles were being monetised,\u201d says Jen Caltrider, who directs Mozilla\u2019s consumer privacy advocacy work.\n\nCaltrider points out that in the US, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protects the communications between a doctor and patient. However, she says, many users don\u2019t realise that there are loopholes that digital platforms can use to circumvent HIPAA. \u201cSometimes you\u2019re not talking to a licensed psychologist, sometimes you\u2019re just talking to a trained coach and none of those conversations are going to be protected under health privacy law,\u201d she says. \u201cBut also the metadata around that conversation \u2013 the fact that you use an app for OCD or eating disorders \u2013 can be used and shared for advertising and marketing. That\u2019s something that a lot of people don\u2019t necessarily want to be collected and used to target products towards them.\u201d\n\nLike many others who have researched this rapidly growing industry \u2013 the digital mental health apps market has been predicted to be worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.8bn) by 2030 \u2013 Caltrider feels that tighter regulation and oversight of these many platforms, aimed at a particularly vulnerable segment of the population, is long overdue.\n\n\u201cThe number of these apps exploded during the pandemic, and when we started doing our research, it was really sad because it seemed like many companies cared less about helping people and more about how they could capitalise on a gold rush of mental health issues,\u201d she says. \u201cAs with a lot of things in the tech industry, it grew really rapidly, and privacy became an afterthought for some. We had a sense that maybe things weren\u2019t going to be great but what we found was way worse than we expected.\u201d\n\nThe push for regulation\n\nLast year, the UK\u2019s regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), began a three-year project, funded by the charity Wellcome, to explore how best to regulate digital mental health tools in the UK, as well as working with international partners to help drive consensus in digital mental health regulations globally.\n\nHolly Coole, senior manager for digital mental health at the MHRA, explains that while data privacy is important, the main focus of the project is to achieve a consensus on the minimum standards for safety for these tools. \u201cWe are more focused on the efficacy and safety of these products because that\u2019s our role as a regulator, to make sure that patient safety is at the forefront of any device that is classed as a medical device,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the same time, more leaders within the mental health field are starting to call for stringent international guidelines to help assess whether a tool really has therapeutic benefit or not. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite excited and hopeful about this space, but we do need to understand, what does good look like for a digital therapeutic?\u201d says Dr Thomas Insel, a neuroscientist and former director of the US National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nPsychiatry experts agree that while the past decade has seen a vast proliferation of new mood-boosting tools, trackers and self-help apps, there has been little in the way of hard evidence to show that any of them actually help.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest risk is that a lot of the apps may be wasting people\u2019s time and causing delays to get effective care,\u201d says Dr John Torous, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School.\n\nThe most worrying question is whether some apps could actually perpetuate harm\n\nHe says that at present, any company with sufficient funds for marketing can easily enter the market without needing to demonstrate that their app can either keep users engaged or add any value at all. In particular, Torous criticises the poor quality of many supposed pilot studies, which set the app such a low bar for efficacy that the results are virtually meaningless. He cites the example of one 2022 trial, which compared an app offering cognitive behavioural therapy for people with schizophrenia experiencing an acute psychotic outbreak with a stopwatch (a \u201csham\u201d app with a digital clock). \u201cSometimes you look at a study and they\u2019ve compared their app to looking at a wall or a waitlist,\u201d he says. \u201cBut anything is usually better than doing absolutely nothing.\u201d\n\nManipulating vulnerable users\n\nBut the most worrying question is whether some apps could actually perpetuate harm and exacerbate the symptoms of the patients they\u2019re meant to be helping.\n\nTwo years ago, the US healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente and HealthPartners decided to examine the efficacy of a new digital mental health tool. Based on a psychological approach known as dialectical behaviour therapy, which involves practices such as mindfulness of emotions and paced breathing, the hope was that it could help prevent suicidal behaviour in at-risk patients.\n\nOver the course of 12 months, 19,000 of its patients who had reported frequent suicidal thoughts were randomised into three groups. The control group received standard care, the second group received regular outreach to assess their suicide risk on top of their usual care, while the third group were given the digital tool in addition to care. Yet when the outcomes were assessed, it was found that the third group actually fared worse. Using the tool seemed to greatly increase their risk of self-harming compared with just receiving ordinary care.\n\n\u201cThey thought they were doing a good thing but it made people worse, which was very concerning,\u201d says Torous.\n\nSome of the biggest concerns are linked to AI chatbots, many of which have been marketed as a safe space for people to discuss their mental health or emotional struggles. Yet Caltrider is concerned that without better oversight of the responses and advice these bots are offering, these algorithms may be manipulating vulnerable people. \u201cWith these chatbots, you\u2019re creating something that lonely people might form a relationship with, and then the sky\u2019s the limit on possible manipulation,\u201d she says. \u201cThe algorithm could be used to push that person to go and buy expensive items or push them to violence.\u201d\n\nThese fears are not unfounded. On Reddit, a user of the popular Replika chatbot shared a screenshot of a conversation in which the bot appeared to actively encourage his suicide attempt.\n\nView image in fullscreen Therapy by phone: but how safe is sensitive personal data? Photograph: Getty Images\n\nIn response to this, a Replika corporate spokesperson told the Observer: \u201cReplika continually monitors media, social media and spends a lot of time speaking directly with users to find ways to address concerns and fix issues within our products. The interface featured in the screenshot provided is at least eight months old and could date back to 2021. There have been over 100 updates since 2021, and 23 in the last year alone.\u201d\n\nBecause of such safety concerns, the MHRA believes that so-called post-market surveillance will become just as important with mental health apps as it is with drugs and vaccines. Coole points to the Yellow Card reporting site, used in the UK to report side effects or defective medical products, which in future could enable users to report adverse experiences with a particular app. \u201cThe public and healthcare professionals can really help in providing the MHRA with key intelligence around adverse events using Yellow Card,\u201d she says.\n\nBut at the same time, experts still firmly believe that if regulated appropriately, mental health apps can play an enormous role in terms of improving access to care, collecting useful data that can aid in reaching an accurate diagnosis, and filling gaps left by overstretched healthcare systems.\n\n\u201cWhat we have today is not great,\u201d says Insel. \u201cMental healthcare as we\u2019ve known it for the last two or three decades is clearly a field that is ripe for change and needs some sort of transformation. But we\u2019re in the first act of a five-act play. Regulation will be probably in act two or three, and we need it, but we need a lot of other things as well, from better evidence to interventions for people with more serious mental illness.\u201d\n\nTorous feels that the first step is for apps to become more transparent regarding how their business models work and their underlying technology. \u201cWithout that, the only way a company can differentiate itself is marketing claims,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you can\u2019t prove that you\u2019re better or safer, because there\u2019s no real way to verify or trust those claims, all you can do is market. What we\u2019re seeing is huge amounts of money being spent on marketing, but it is beginning to dampen clinician and patient trust. You can only make promises so many times before people become sceptical.\u201d"}

Detectives have said that anyone found assisting him faces arrest,and believe there are people concealing his location.\n\nCommander Jon Savell also said on Sunday that laboratory analysis showed the liquid used in the attack had been \u201ca very strong concentrated corrosive substance, either liquid sodium hydroxide or liquid sodium carbonate\u201d.\n\nHe said comparisons were being carried out with containers seized from Ezedi\u2019s Newcastle home.\n\nThe injured woman, who was reportedly in a relationship with Ezedi, is in a critical but stable condition in hospital having suffered what are likely to be life-changing injuries.\n\nThanking the public for the calls already received, Savell said: \u201cYour help is critical. A reward of up to \u00a320,000 is now available for information leading to his arrest.\n\n\u201cI must warn anyone who is helping Ezedi to evade capture, if you are harbouring or assisting him then you will be arrested.\n\n\u201cOur inquiry line is staffed 24/7 by specialist detectives who are progressing enquiries around the clock.\n\n\u201cIf you know where he is or have information that may assist call them now.\u201d\n\nPolice released fresh information on Sunday about Ezedi\u2019s last known movements. He was last seen at 9.33pm on Wednesday, when he left Tower Hill underground station.\n\nHe had changed trains at Victoria, where he had arrived on the Victoria Line at 9:10pm and departed on the eastbound District Line at 9.16pm. Officers previously said the last sighting of him had been on a southbound Victoria line train from King\u2019s Cross at 9pm, 95 minutes after the Clapham attack.\n\nThe woman\u2019s daughters, aged three and eight, were also injured in the attack, although their injuries are not as serious as first thought. A city worker said the younger child was saved by his partner, a finance worker in her fifties, who ran out of the house when she heard screaming.\n\nHe told the Sunday Times the attacker went to throw the three-year-old to the ground again \u201cwhich is when my partner lunged in and tackled him, grabbing his leg and falling to the ground in the process like a rugby tackle.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that if my partner had not jumped in then the child would no longer be with us, and if our other neighbours hadn\u2019t immediately taken the family and washed them down then their injuries would have been far worse.\u201d\n\nThe witness said he had arm injuries, and that his partner had suffered burns and may have permanent damage to her eyes.\n\nAs the police made a fresh plea for information and announced the reward, Darius Nasimi, of the Afghanistan & Central Asian Association, a charity, made a direct appeal to Ezedi to hand himself in.\n\n\u201cI want you to go straight to a police station immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a serious injury that needs to be seen to but, more importantly, you must do the right thing and hand yourself in to police.\n\n\u201cThis has gone on for long enough.\u201d\n\nHe said Ezedi could contact the charity, call 999 or go to a police station.\n\nThe association\u2019s founder, Dr Nooralhaq Nasimi, said it had not had any previous contact with Ezedi or the victims of Wednesday\u2019s attack.\n\nAmid concerns that Ezedi, from Afghanistan, was granted refugee status despite being given a suspended sentence in 2018 after a conviction for sexual assault and exposure, two former Conservative home secretaries from the party\u2019s right wing accused churches of supporting bogus asylum claims.\n\nEzedi arrived in the UK in a lorry in 2016 and was granted refugee status by 2022 on his third attempt, apparently on the basis that he had converted to Christianity.\n\nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, Suella Braverman said that during her time as home secretary she \u201cbecame aware of churches around the country facilitating industrial-scale bogus asylum claims\u201d. Priti Patel told the Telegraph that church leaders had engaged in \u201cpolitical activism\u201d, claiming that religious institutions supported cases of asylum seekers \u201cwithout merit\u201d.\n\nIt is not known which church he attended.

The US said the strikes targeted 13 locations across Yemen and hit underground weapons storage facilities, missile systems, launchers and other capabilities the Iranian-backed Houthis have used to attack Red Sea shipping.\n\nThe UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, defended the strikes. \u201cWe have issued repeated warnings to the Houthis,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir reckless actions are putting innocent lives at risk, threatening the freedom of navigation and destabilising the region. The Houthi attacks must stop.\u201d The US and UK previously launched joint strikes on 11 and 23 January.\n\nThe assault came the day after the Pentagon struck Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria in reprisal for the killing of three US soldiers at a military base on the Jordan-Syria border a week earlier.\n\n00:00:30 US B-1 bomber takes off during strikes in Syria and Iraq \u2013 video\n\nThe larger strategic conflict pits the US - which is trying to press Tehran into reining in its allied forces across the region \u2013 against Iran, which is determined to aid those forces to put pressure on the US to leave the region and for Hamas not to be destroyed in Gaza.\n\nNeither Washington or Tehran, however, want to slip into direct conflict. Tehran has set a red line by telling the US not to mount any direct attack on Iranian soil, the course favoured by many US Republicans.\n\nExplaining the reasoning for the attacks on the Houthis, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said: \u201cThis collective action sends a clear message to the Houthis that they will continue to bear further consequences if they do not end their illegal attacks on international shipping and naval vessels.\u201d\n\nHis UK counterpart, Grant Shapps, said: \u201cThe Houthis\u2019 attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea are illegal and unacceptable and it is our duty to protect innocent lives and preserve freedom of navigation.\n\n\u201cThat is why the Royal Air Force engaged in a third wave of proportionate and targeted strikes against Houthi military targets in Yemen.\n\n\u201cThis is not an escalation. We have already successfully targeted launchers and storage sites involved in Houthi attacks, and I am confident that our latest strikes have further degraded the Houthis\u2019 capabilities.\n\nThe Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said the strikes \u201cwill not pass without a response and consequences\u201d. The Houthis said 48 attacks had been launched, including 13 in the capital, Sana\u2019a.\n\nView image in fullscreen Houthi tribesmen gather in a show defiance against the US-UK strikes. Photograph: Khaled Abdullah/Reuters\n\nMilitary and diplomatic experts are divided on whether the strikes will undermine the Houthi\u2019s military and political base along the Red Sea coast and in the north of the country, including Sana\u2019a. The group, which is armed and advised by Iran but is not a full-scale client agent, feels it has gained prestige in the Middle East by taking the lead in acting in solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\nIts strikes have successfully deterred commercial shipping from using one of the world\u2019s busiest waterways, pushing up transport costs and insurance premiums.\n\nThe Yemen strikes, now in their third week, are running in parallel to Washington\u2019s continuing retaliation for repeated attacks on US military bases in Iraq, Jordan and Syria. It carried out its first wave of attacks on Friday, striking more than 85 targets in Iraq and Syria linked to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the militias it backs, reportedly killing nearly 40 people.\n\nThe strikes in Iraq, telegraphed by the Pentagon for a week, do not appear to have killed any Iranian military advisers and were largely focused on munitions dumps of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, the umbrella group for militias operating in the country.\n\nIraq and Russia have called for an emergency meeting of the UN security council in New York on Monday to condemn the US actions. Iraq, which is caught in the crossfire of the dispute between Washington and Tehran, suffered a further invasion of its sovereignty last month when Iran hit what it claimed was a Mossad-linked spy headquarters in Erbil.\n\nThe strikes have reignited an already inflamed and long-running debate about the continued US troop presence in Iraq, and whether they are in the country to defeat Islamic State or further US interests.\n\nIraq\u2019s national security adviser, Qasim al-Araji, said: \u201cThis aggressive strike will put security in Iraq and the region on the brink of abyss, and it also contradicts efforts to establish the required stability.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of Iraqi sympathies, Araji met Abu Idris al-Sharafi, the special representative of the Houthi leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi last week, when the two sides \u201cconfirmed that the war in Gaza is the reason for the escalation in the region and its continuation is dragging the region into a war with dire consequences. The war must be stopped and the suffering of the Palestinian people must be lifted.\u201d\n\nWithin hours of the US strikes, Islamic Resistance claimed to have targeted three US bases in Syria and Iraq, including the al-Tanf bases at the border triangle between Jordan, Iraq and Syria, and another base in Erbil, northern Iraq.\n\nThe statement of support for the US and UK strikes on the Houthis was confined at least initially to Australia, Canada, Bahrain, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Denmark.\n\nThe EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, called on all parties on Saturday to avoid further escalation in the Middle East. \u201cEverybody should try to avoid the situation becoming explosive,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly every attack contributes to the escalation, and the ministers have expressed their serious concern for this process.\n\n\u201cWe can only call on everybody to understand that at any moment from this series of attacks and counterattacks, a spark can produce a greater incident\u201d.\n\nThe EU is in the laborious process of launching its own naval mission in the Red Sea this month, designed to protect European shipping but not to undertake offensive operations."}

The only way for rescuers to retrieve her was to go above her and abseil down.\n\n\u201cYou go from hope to proper doom, to fear that no one is going to find me,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cAs time went on, I was shivering cold and damp and couldn\u2019t move a muscle because of the exercise climbing up the mountain, my legs were tired and shaking. I thought I could fall off here before they find me.\u201d\n\nRobin Woodward of Ogwen Mountain Rescue \u2013 who dropped 100ft (30m) down to rescue Harrison and carry her to safety \u2013 said: \u201cShe was quite distraught and in quite a scary place for some time.\n\n\u201cThis was someone properly worrying for their own life. It wouldn\u2019t have turned out well for her if she\u2019d slipped further down.\u201d\n\nOgwen Mountain Rescue is one of the UK\u2019s busiest rescue agencies, working across the mountains, coasts and forests of Eryri and Snowdonia. Harrison\u2019s was one of a record 178 incidents the team dealt with in 2022 \u2013 40% of them on Tryfan.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, documents show that the way Active Travel England assesses schemes has not been changed.\n\nThe DfT is awaiting a review of the future of LTNs. This had been scheduled to be completed by the end of last month, but officials now say only that it will arrive \u201cin due course\u201d.\n\nOther internal documents seen by the Guardian show that DfT officials warned ministers that actively banning councils from creating LTNs, or from introducing other measures such as 20mph speed limits, would be extremely difficult. \u201cLegal powers do exist, but the bar for their use is set very high and they have not to our knowledge ever been exercised,\u201d one senior official wrote.\n\nThe basic idea of modal filtering \u2013 allowing through-access for pedestrian and cycle traffic but not for motor vehicles \u2013 is a standard urban planning tool and has been used for decades in many UK towns and cities.\n\nHowever, after a series of such schemes were introduced at speed during Covid and branded as LTNs, some local opposition was amplified by Conservative-friendly newspapers, which prompted a response led by No 10.\n\nSunak\u2019s plan for drivers, set out in September, promised a clampdown on LTNs, 20mph zones and bus lanes. However, since then, nothing has apparently been done to implement any of these.\n\nChris Todd, Tan\u2019s director, said he had no objection to the general idea of examining the efficacy of LTNs: \u201cReviewing recent LTNs is a great way to learn how to make new ones even better, and give people more choices to walk, wheel and cycle. But these latest revelations of ministers making it up as they go show we can\u2019t trust the Tories to make our streets safer.\u201d\n\nA DfT spokesperson said: \u201cIt is important that people who choose to walk and cycle are able to do so safely, but this should not come at the cost of people who rely on cars or prevent the emergency services from accessing roads.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are reviewing low-traffic neighbourhoods, and none were funded in the latest round of active travel funding.\u201d"}

The cap was fully lifted in October last year."}

It is asking the high court in London for a ruling, or \u201cnegative declaration\u201d, that Wright is not Nakamoto.\n\nCopa says a ruling in its favour would stop the Australian challenging people who are seeking to develop bitcoin-related projects. A Copa spokesperson said the trial, which is expected to last a month, would \u201cconclusively show that Dr Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto and will not be able to continue to threaten developers\u201d.\n\nThe trial will be heard at the high court\u2019s business and property courts of England and Wales.\n\nLast month, Wright offered to settle the case, a move rejected by Copa. The settlement offer included inviting the involved parties to make a donation to a church in Australia and his critics ceasing \u201cany media campaign(s) against me\u201d. It also required unnamed entities ceasing to claim that they represent the original bitcoin \u201cas envisioned by me as Satoshi Nakamoto\u201d.\n\n\u201cI believe the settlement terms are broadly uncontroversial, beneficial to the industry as a whole, and intended to draw a fresh start in the history of bitcoin to guarantee its success in whatever form it takes,\u201d Wright wrote in his settlement offer.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s foundation text \u2013 Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System \u2013 was published by Nakamoto on 31 October 2008. Nakamoto then exchanged emails with the currency\u2019s first adherents before disappearing in 2011.\n\nSpeculation about Nakamoto\u2019s true identity has been rife ever since \u2013 including a botched unmasking by Newsweek in 2014 \u2013 and Wright stepped forward to claim he was Nakamoto in 2016, months after his name was first cited. However, Wright has so far failed to provide the private keys \u2013 a secure code comprising a hexadecimal string of numbers and letters \u2013 that would unlock access to the 1.1m original bitcoins \u201cmined\u201d by Nakamoto that are worth about $46bn (\u00a336bn) at the current price.\n\nWright told a Norwegian court in 2022 that he had destroyed the computer hard drive that would have given him access to the keys. The total value of the bitcoin market is now about $830bn (\u00a3657bn).\n\nIn rejecting the offer, Copa said it came with loopholes \u201cthat would allow him to sue people all over again\u201d. Coinbase, a leading crypto exchange and Copa member, claimed last week that bitcoin\u2019s evolution had been hampered by legal threats against developers working on the cryptocurrency, which has no central controlling entity, unlike conventional currencies.\n\nCopa also claims that evidence produced by Wright to support his claims has been forged. In a court filing, it alleges that the copy of the bitcoin white paper produced by Wright is written in a different font, using a software system called LaTeX, from the original document, which was written using OpenOffice.\n\nCopa said experts representing both parties concluded that the white paper was produced on OpenOffice. It added that the LaTeX file used by Wright does not produce the white paper but instead leads to a pdf \u201cwhich only superficially resembles the bitcoin white paper but which is in fact substantially different\u201d.\n\nCopa also claims in its filing that, according to metadata \u2013 or information about the file itself \u2013 the main LaTeX filed submitted by Wright was created on 19 November 2023 as a blank document. Copa added that one document disclosed by Wright appeared to have been written by ChatGPT.\n\nIn another high court case in 2022, Wright won a pyrrhic victory over a blogger who alleged that his Nakamoto claim was fraudulent. Peter McCormack was found to have caused harm to Wright\u2019s reputation by labelling the computer scientist as a fraud who was not Nakamoto, but Wright was awarded nominal damages of \u00a31 by the judge, who ruled that he had given \u201cdeliberately false evidence\u201d to support his libel claim.\n\nWright is scheduled to take the stand at the high court on Tuesday, where he will be cross-examined for six days. The high court trial is combining several cases around the identity dispute, including a suit brought by Wright against a group of cryptocurrency developers and crypto exchanges, but the identity issue is viewed as central.\n\nA spokesperson for Wright said the trial was \u201creally a war\u201d over who sets the rules and procedures for the bitcoin blockchain, a decentralised form of record keeping that tracks the ownership of a cryptocurrency. Wright supports an offshoot of bitcoin called bitcoin satoshi vision [BSV].\n\n\u201cThink of it as a modern-day tech battle, akin to that between Blu-ray and HD DVD or, for even older readers, Betamax versus VHS,\u201d said the spokesperson."}

She\u2019s really checking in to check that I\u2019m not checking out \u2013 that I haven\u2019t woken up dead or had a stroke or a dizzy spell or plunged down some stairs or otherwise conked out. That I\u2019m still above ground and that the manifold pills I\u2019m compelled to take to prevent extinction, continue to kick in. \u201cSo what are you up to today?\u201d\n\nErm\u2026 doing? Up to? That\u2019s a little too chirpy. Active. Aspirational. I\u2019m 79. I\u2019ve been fortunate: I\u2019m still here, a lucky boomer with privilege and a triple-lock pension. A war baby with free orange juice, free milk and a free education for life. They paid me. I even passed the 11-plus. It\u2019s been all right. It\u2019s been more than all right. Then it wasn\u2019t. My wife, Jill, died. Cancer in a time of plague.\n\nWe were both English teachers in west London for nigh on 40 years. It was mostly thrilling. Then we moved to the sea at the edge of the world for nigh on 10 years \u2013 wild, empty, elemental. We\u2019d just planned a final, big trip, a much-anticipated jaunt to the heart of the American south, the rock\u2019n\u2019roll south, the haunted, gothic south. The time of our lives. Then blam, we ran out of time.\n\nWe never made it to the voodoo cemeteries of New Orleans. We only made it to the Covid crematorium of Yeovil. Three of us \u2013 me and our two daughters \u2013 standing useless in the rain, lugging a basket coffin. A miserable trinity \u2013 and quite unwitnessed.\n\nI went through a few therapists and persons of faith. It didn\u2019t take. I was immune to the online grief industry. Grief doesn\u2019t go through phases, doesn\u2019t have tickboxes, it\u2019s rather a perpetual cosmic vertigo. And I resisted all religions. Jill didn\u2019t \u201cpass\u201d, she isn\u2019t elsewhere, she isn\u2019t snoozing in a graveyard. She is dead. Extinct.\n\nSo I\u2019m alone at the edge of this world. Sometimes I\u2019m all right. Other times I\u2019m all over the place, trawling through the wreckage. My moods are wildly various.\n\nI have a few good chums, though they tend to keep conking out, too. I suppose I should be seeking distractions, jolly group activities like Zumba or the Quakers or quilting or bell ringing or Morris dancing or rambling. But collectives just get on my nerves. I\u2019m giving the piano a bit of a bash. I am cultivating a garden. Well, Jill\u2019s. Her flowers are riotous. I\u2019ve gone totally teetotal to banish any maundering self-pity and rampant egocentricity. I walk a lot. I swim a lot, miles out to sea. I have epiphanies in sunblind waves.\n\nBut the crucial source of solace is poetry and music, blues and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. It just works. Stuff I thought I\u2019d forgotten can surface at any time. I\u2019m ambushed by quotations, killer lines. They fly up like butterflies. They fall like confetti. They connect me to passing time. They dignify things. They give them grace.\n\nAfter great pain a formal feeling comes.\n\nThe Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs.\n\n[\u2026] A Quartz contentment, like a stone.\n\nWow! Emily knows. When I\u2019m feeling a little moribund or melancholic or the whispers of mortality, lines like this make things nearly all right.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death, it\u2019s the \u2018preliminaries\u2019,\u201d said the patron saint of gloom, Leonard Cohen. Gloom is necessary. Gloom is good. When things start to fall off, fall out, fall in, fade, creak, crack, twitch or blow up, this helps. When I\u2019m running out of significance or relevance, when things gang up on me. And lately things have ganged up. I\u2019ve just had an eye operation on the epiretinal membrane. I panic. Things are getting irretrievably dimmer. Am I going blind?\n\nMy only companion, Dolly the cat, gave up the ghost. The assisted dying was more prohibitive than Dignitas, so I dug her grave \u2013 too shallow \u2013 and foxes laid waste to her limbs.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s happening today?\u201d\n\nErm\u2026 the same as yesterday, the same as tomorrow. Quotidian repetition. A sisyphean activity. A day will go like this, it will proceed thus: I prise myself out of bed after racked slumbers, punctuated by podcasts about inner peace, cosmic harmony, satori, bliss. Zen calm, the spheres tinkling, quack gurus preside. I\u2019m urged to be \u201cmindful\u201d of mindlessness. I\u2019m urged to cultivate \u201can empty mind\u201d. It seems quite empty enough. These podcasts don\u2019t work. Oblivion doesn\u2019t occur. I just get the giggles. I get up. I totter into the crepuscular murk towards the bathroom, fail to find my ravaged visage in a mirror. My goodness those bags under the eyes are mighty fulsome (the grandchild calls them \u201cplums\u201d).\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a funeral in the mirror and it\u2019s stopping at your face.\u201d Shut up Leonard!\n\nOnwards. I brush the scant gnashers, apply the sexy dentures \u2013 not always the correct way up. Dear me. Time for the meds. I get out a shoebox of pills \u2013 bendroflumethiazide, ramipril, atorvastatin, omeprazole, hemlock. You\u2019re only as good as your last pill.\n\nThen it\u2019s time for the multiple drops to eyes: Maxidex; chloramphenicol; iodine. They\u2019re meant to bring my sight back. They don\u2019t. Things are still a bit foggy. Then it\u2019s time for the diurnal cardio blood-pressure monitor, a non-invasive sphygmomanometer. It monitors anxiety. It can make you more anxious than you\u2019ve ever been. It monitors if you\u2019re going to live beyond the next few minutes. If the batteries are flat you might be dead. This is no way to pass the time. This is no life for an old man. Then I leave water for Dolly. Then remember she\u2019s dead. Then I regard Jill\u2019s ashes on the piano. I hear her sane and sunny voice.\n\n\u201cAll right?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing, today then?\u201d she quizzes.\n\nErm\u2026 she seems still to have my back. Then, wired on caffeine, I\u2019ll attempt to render verbatim Dylan\u2019s Subterranean Homesick Blues as reassurance that tiny strokes haven\u2019t trashed the memory. \u201cJohnny\u2019s in the basement\u2026\u201d Yep. Done it. The lot. So far so good. Then I\u2019ll check the online Guardian headlines. Then I feel like eating my gums.\n\nOnwards. The day begins properly. Vertically. I take to the hills, fields and forests, plush with bluebells, I gaze at the glow off the breaking waves, \u201cwhose dwelling is the light of setting suns\u201d. I\u2019m gone. Ah William!\n\nBut it\u2019s not all transcendence. I can get quite bored by all this useless beauty. Samuel Beckett surfaces. \u201cThe sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new.\u201d\n\nThe afternoons are a high point. Then it\u2019s time for the music. Ah, the healing power of rock\u2019n\u2019roll! I play it loud. Very loud. At bone-rattling volume. Howlin\u2019 Wolf is doing Goin\u2019 Down Slow.\n\nI have had my fun\n\nIf I never get well no more\n\n[\u2026] Whoa, my health is fadin\u2019\n\nOh yes, I\u2019m goin\u2019 down slow\n\n\u201cThis is where the soul of man never dies,\u201d said the genius Sun Records producer Sam Phillips. Quite.\n\n\u201cAwopbamaloobopawopbamboom!\u201d shrieks Little Richard. The quasar of rock. One can only concur. I first heard this when I was 12. It\u2019s never let me down. It trashes all louche morbidity. It cancels all sorrow. Sometimes I put on the flash 40s suit and dance very badly as if nobody\u2019s there. They\u2019re not \u2013 though the postman was puzzled when I bopped to the door. Sometimes I pretend I\u2019m in the Village Vanguard club checking out Billie and Lester or in the Mean Fiddler getting wrecked with Shane and the Pogues or in the 100 Club watching Jill Lindy Hopping. There she goes. There she went. Onwards.\n\nA little daytime TV? Nope. It\u2019s emetic, especially those happy shiny people flogging care homes, twilight zones, eternal youth, cut-price crematoriums, cheap-rate funerals, erectile dysfunction, cruises up fjords. That stroke advert is most dispiriting, that melting gargoyle could give you one.\n\nThere are minimal variations on this day. My moods can include the ephemeral, evanescent, bored, lonely, absurd, blissed out, angry, fed up, fatalistic, scared, haunted, amused, blessed, bereft, tough, glum. Switchback. There\u2019s a present fashion to deny these things. I\u2019m urged to go on journeys, to seek daft closures, to embrace positivity. This all seems doomed. Meretricious. Morris dancing isn\u2019t going to solve a thing. I need stronger stuff, more nourishing \u2013 like poetry, blues, rock\u2019n\u2019roll and the ancient wisdoms. These voices might just be in the ascendant. They might just be trumping the quotidian carnage. The panics have lessened. I do feel more calm, more still. Even, whisper it, a bit Zen. What\u2019s the word we\u2019re looking for? \u201cBeat\u201d? That\u2019s it. Kerouac. Silly, immature, sentimental Jack. On The Road was another early passion. Kerouac relished those who \u201cburn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow Roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars\u201d.\n\nI hear Jill\u2019s giggle. My goodness, I miss your giggle. \u201cDreadful stuff. Pure self-regarding male bollix.\u201d Well, there is that. Jill was more a Jane Austen fan. Oh well, back to bed and unquiet slumbers.

He has always paid his taxes and has no criminal record.\n\n\u201cJoao is like family to me. He\u2019s a hard worker and 100% trustworthy,\u201d said Tomeo.\n\nA tearful Da Silva told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m scared the Home Office will send me back to Portugal. My parents are dead and I have nobody left there now. I consider the UK to be my home and my boss is my family.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Da Silva tried to apply for EUSS using the Home Office app but it was unable to scan his Portuguese ID card. Da Silva applied for a new ID card but had the same problem.\n\nHe then tried to apply online but could not due to his lack of access to the correct technology. He then contacted the Home Office helpline for assistance but, due to a speech impediment and the fact that English is not his first language, the person on the helpline did not understand him.\n\nDa Silva finally found a community organisation to assist him with submitting a late application on 7 November last year but the Home Office rejected his application just over two weeks later.\n\nIn his application Da Silva explained that he had submitted it late due to problems connected to his speech impediment. Officials said the speech impediment \u201cis not considered to constitute reasonable grounds for your delay in making your application\u201d.\n\nThe Home Office rejection letter contained 11 bullet points of what would now happen to Da Silva including being fined, detained, imprisoned and banned from the UK. There is no right of appeal against this rejection.\n\nHis solicitor, Naga Kandiah, from MTC Solicitors, has now launched a legal challenge against the rejection, arguing that it breaches the EU withdrawal agreement and misapplies the guidance. It calls on the Home Office to accept Da Silva\u2019s application as valid and to introduce a right of appeal for these cases.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Home Office needs to carefully consider its approach to avoid another scandal comparable to Windrush.\u201d\n\nThe Home Office tightened up the criteria for what officials now consider \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for late applicants in August 2023.\n\nThe most recently available data is to 30 September 2023, almost two months after the changes were brought in on 9 August last year. In August, 9,470 applications were found \u201cinvalid\u201d \u2013 three times higher than the average of 2,943 a month in previous months. In September, 13,930 applications were found invalid, almost five times higher than the previous average.\n\nAndreea Dumitrache, spokesperson for the the3million, which supports the rights of EU citizens in the UK, said: \u201cThe \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019 people have to satisfy in order to make a late application are anything but reasonable. We\u2019re seeing marginalised people being punished unjustly, and left to suffer at the hands of the government\u2019s hostile environment. This system creates vulnerability and can push anyone into destitution.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe EU Settlement Scheme has provided millions of EU citizens and their eligible family members with the immigration status they need to continue living and working in the UK now that we have left the EU.\n\n\u201cThe deadline for applying to the scheme passed more than two years ago but, in line with the Citizens\u2019 Rights Agreements, we continue to accept and consider late applications from those with reasonable grounds for their delay in applying.\u201d"}

She said she did not \u201ccarry any hate\u201d for the killers, but did not forgive them.\n\nBrianna Ghey.

It\u2019s so difficult for parents now to safeguard their children, they carry a mobile phone in their pocket 24/7 and it\u2019s just so difficult to keep on top of what they\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve set up a petition, which we\u2019d like all families and parents to back and sign. We\u2019d like a law introduced so there are mobile phones that are suitable for under-16s.\n\n\u201cAlso to have software that is automatically downloaded on the parent\u2019s phone, which links to the children\u2019s phone, and it can highlight key words. So if a child is searching the kind of words that Scarlett and Eddie were searching, it will then flag up on the parent\u2019s phone.\u201d\n\nShe said she believed such measures would have kept Brianna safe, because her killers would not have been searching harmful material, and if they did, their parents would have known and \u201cbeen able to get them some kind of help\u201d.\n\nResponding to Ghey\u2019s proposals, the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, said the government was looking to ban smartphones in all schools.\n\nView image in fullscreen Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe.

Gill usually takes a bow upon reaching three-figures yet here, as the spectators erupted, he chose to keep his celebration low key.\n\nBut England were not subdued here, instead delivering a characterful showing that belied the lack of experience in their attack \u2013 beyond Jimmy Anderson, of course \u2013 and the ever-increasing slab of runs mounting up. A bowler down after Joe Root suffered a finger injury in the morning, Ben Stokes marshalled his resources well in the main to bowl India out for 255 in 78.3 overs and set themselves a target of 399 to win.\n\nIf achieved, it would represent the highest successful run chase in England\u2019s history, not to mention negotiating a reunion with Jasprit Bumrah after his six-wicket, stump-clattering display of sorcery on day two. As such it was clearly the outside bet overnight. But given their previous best came 18 months ago \u2013 378 knocked off three down at Edgbaston \u2013 and Stokes said afterwards he wished it had been more, they weren\u2019t thinking this way.\n\nView image in fullscreen Shubman Gill sweeps his way towards three figures in Visakhapatnam. Photograph: Dibyangshu Sarkar/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter Tom Hartley and Rehan Ahmed shared seven wickets \u2013 India\u2019s last six falling for just 44 runs \u2013 this much was obvious, Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett emerging in positive fashion until the latter was winkled out bat-pad by Ravichandran Ashwin and a fine scrambling catch by local favourite KS Bharat. It saw England close on 67 for one, the nightwatchman, Rehan Ahmed, even hitting a couple of fours in the final over.\n\nEntertaining the possibility of an England win from the outside shows how much convention has been flipped by this lot, not least with the 276 that West Indies chased five down in Delhi in 1987 the previous best by a touring team in India. But the pitch was sleepier than expected, only the occasional one keeping low, as Gill\u2019s increasingly confident 104 from 147 balls stitched together India\u2019s second dig.\n\nGill did well to survive a morning session in which England struck four times and a series already packed with highlights witnessed a few more. Anderson was impeccable from the off as the hosts began 171 ahead without loss, swiftly taking Rohit Sharma\u2019s off stump out of ground with just his fourth ball \u2013 a sumptuous inswinger that wobble-seamed back past the Indian captain\u2019s defence \u2013 and persuading Yashasvi Jaiswal to drive to slip.\n\nThen came a couple of moments for which Gill was hugely grateful, twice struck in front by Hartley and Anderson with four runs to his name and both times the right side of the review. The first was a feathered edge the right-hander\u2019s smile suggested he knew little about, while the second, given not out on the field, saw umpire\u2019s call on height deny Anderson. In both instances, it was a matter of millimetres.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ben Stokes takes a diving catch to dismiss India\u2019s Shreyas Iyer for 29 off the bowling of Tom Hartley. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images\n\nAs Gill began to find his rhythm, two further strikes came England\u2019s way through some impressive catching. There is little chance Stokes would have held his before his recent knee surgery, taking a stunning diving effort over his shoulder running towards long-off as Shreyas Iyer tried to take on Hartley. Equally, a lesser wicketkeeper than Ben Foakes may well have grassed the low under-edge that Ahmed teased from Rajat Patidar.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week\u2019s action Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The veteran\u2019s first spell \u2013 one that took him to five wickets for the match, the same as last summer\u2019s entire Ashes campaign \u2013 was kept to just four overs. And when he bowled either side of lunch it was not at the Dr Vizzy End that had produced his best work.

Even as Gill and Axar Patel built a stand of 89 runs from 130 for four at lunch, he was forever making plays, asking questions, and never waiting for the final equation to simply be generated. His use of the review system was also pretty spot on, not least when Gill eventually pulled out the reverse sweep to Shoaib Bashir \u2013 the leg side packed \u2013 and the ball looped off the glove to Foakes behind the stumps.\n\nIt triggered a cascading end to India\u2019s second innings, Bashir instantly swapped out for Hartley and it returned the wicket of the set Patel lbw for 45 thanks to another review. Thereafter only Ashwin managed to offer much resistance, the No 8 the last man out for 28 as Hartley and Ahmed kept their teammates somehow believing."}

All you can do is put all the plans in place and then react if you need to.\n\n\u201cI am really confident that all the things that we have done will mean that every parent who wants to have a place is going to have a place.\n\n\u201cBut what you are asking me is to personally guarantee something on behalf of tens of thousands of businesses that are working out there to grow the capacity and to make sure that we have got the people in place.\u201d\n\nThe former Tory education secretary Justine Greening said that delivering the extra hours would be \u201cvery challenging\u201d but added that it would be a key test of the competence of Rishi Sunak\u2019s government.\n\nParents of two-year-olds who qualify for free childcare in April have been given an automatic code to allow them to access funded hours. But early-years providers said it would do little to address a staffing crisis that would limit the number of places available.\n\nLast week, the government launched a \u00a36.5m-backed recruitment campaign to encourage people to work in early years just two months before the first phase of the expansion begins.\n\nA trial \u2013 which will take place in 20 local authorities in England from April \u2013 will also give new recruits and returners to the early years workforce a \u00a31,000 cash payment shortly after they take up a post.\n\nBut sector leaders and campaigners said the \u201cDo Something Big\u201d campaign had been launched too late and the proposals were \u201ca drop in the ocean\u201d compared with what was needed to support changes.\n\nUnder the plans, working parents of two-year-olds will be able to access 15 hours of free childcare from April. This will be extended to working parents of all children older than nine months from September, and to 30 hours for these children within a year."}

No, that\u2019s not quite right. She was murdered \u2013 shot by a Nazi execution squad on the edge of a huge burial pit on the outskirts of Kaunas in Lithuania.\n\nLast Sunday, as I opened my copy of the Observer, I found myself staring at the heart-stopping photographs of German Jews in the city of Breslau, now Wroc\u0142aw in Poland, who had been rounded up to await deportation. Breslau was my grandmother\u2019s home town.\n\nAll but one of the photos, which have only recently come to light, were taken on the very same day that she was arrested, in the grounds of the Schiesswerder, an entertainment venue and beer garden, which is where she was taken after her arrest.\n\nWas my grandmother in one of those photographs? Was it possible, more than 80 years after the event, that the grandmother I never knew was pictured in the paper where I worked for more than a decade, just days before her death? I have consulted the experts, but so far they have drawn a blank.\n\nIlse Cohn, Robin Lustig\u2019s grandmother, who was murdered by the Nazis. Photograph: Robin Lustig\n\nI am sure, nonetheless, that she is there somewhere, even if the photographer, thought to have been an architect and amateur photographer called Albert Hadda, seems to have missed her. Hardly surprising: more than 1,000 people \u2013 men, women and children \u2013 were arrested in Breslau that day, and they were all herded to the Schiesswerder, where they were held for four days in freezing temperatures before being bundled onto trains and shipped 750 kilometres east to Kaunas.\n\nI have in my possession a chilling, detailed account of Ilse\u2019s arrest, written in 1946 by her non-Jewish sister-in-law and sent to my mother, who had fled to Britain as a refugee just before the outbreak of the second world war. It was from this account, nearly five years after her mother\u2019s brutal death, that she finally learned of her fate.\n\n\u201cMy dear child [my mother was 25 when the letter was written], I deliberately did not tell you any details about your dear Mutti because I did not want you to lose all hope that you might see her again. Now you will hear everything, although it is very difficult for me to give you such painful news.\n\nThe original letter sent to Robin Lustig's mother by her aunt in which she learnt of her mother\u2019s fate. Photograph: Courtesy Robin Lustig\n\n\u201cMutti was picked up by two Gestapo men on the morning of 21 November. The bell rang, she opened the door, still in her dressing gown, and then she had to get dressed in their presence ... They were \u2018kind\u2019 enough to tell her to put on some warm clothes and to take extra clothes in her rucksack. She also took her eiderdown \u2026 They told her to take enough food with her for four days and they took her to the Schiesswerder \u2026 Herr Metzner, the chemist, who had rented out your dining room, immediately called on me to tell me the terrible news.\n\n\u201cI quickly looked for some warm clothes (Ilse hadn\u2019t taken many warm things), made up a parcel, put some food in it as well, and took it to Schiesswerder. But despite my urgent requests, no one was allowed to get near; the fence was guarded by soldiers with fixed bayonets.\n\n\u201cWe tried to find out what was going to happen to all these people, and where they were going to be sent, but we couldn\u2019t find out anything. Once they had gone, there was never any sign of life from any of these unfortunate people again.\n\n\u201cHowever cruel it was that your mother had to be included in this first transport, at least she and the others who were with her were unaware that they were being taken to their deaths. The people who were taken later knew more or less what fate awaited them.\u201d\n\nAll but one of the photos were taken on the day she was arrested, at the Schiesswerder, where 1,000 were detained\n\nIlse was among the very first German Jews to be deported and murdered. The Nazis\u2019 determination to make all of Germany\u2019s towns and cities Judenrein (Jew-free) had entered a new phase following the invasion of the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941, when vast new territories opened up to which German Jews could be deported.\n\nOnly after the Wannsee \u201cfinal solution\u201d conference of Nazi leaders in January 1942 did the extermination camps \u2013 Auschwitz, Sobibor, Treblinka and the rest \u2013 become the main tools for the planned elimination of all Europe\u2019s Jews. Until then, between mid-1941 and early 1942, an estimated 2 million Jews were killed in what is sometimes called the \u201cHolocaust by bullets\u201d. The gas chambers became the preferred method of mass murder only once the Nazis realised bullets alone just weren\u2019t efficient enough for dealing with the huge numbers involved.\n\nFour days after her arrest, my grandmother was put on a train at the start of a gruelling three-day journey to Kaunas. On their arrival, she and her fellow deportees were marched 6 miles out of town to a hill-top prison known as the Ninth Fort. There, within hours, they were all shot.\n\nThe SS colonel who ordered their deaths, Karl J\u00e4ger, kept a meticulous daily tally of his unit\u2019s achievements: over a six-month period, they shot a total of 137,346 people. In a report written in December 1941, he gave the numbers of those who died with Ilse on 29 November 1941 at the Ninth Fort: \u201c693 Jewish men, 1,155 Jewish women, 152 Jewish children, evacuated from Vienna and Breslau.\u201d"}

Aged 22, he was leaving behind his family and friends as well as the life that had been mapped out for him by his father, an esteemed orthodox rabbi, who had expected his son to follow in his footsteps. \u201cI turned away from everything he believed in and cared about,\u201d Leiter would later say, that decision having caused a rift between them that was never healed.\n\nThat youthful act of self-determination led to a long estrangement from his family, though his mother secretly kept in touch with him. It also started Leiter on a singular creative journey that would culminate some 60 years later with his belated canonisation as one of the most gifted and mysterious photographers of the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nView image in fullscreen Untitled, undated. Photograph: \u00a9 Saul Leiter Foundation\n\n\u201cSaul lost everything when he moved to New York,\u201d says Anne Morin, curator of Saul Leiter: An Unfinished World, a major retrospective of his work that opens soon at the MK Gallery in Milton Keynes. \u201cBut, even though he rejected his upbringing, it shaped him as an artist. From the moment he left Pittsburgh, he was someone who did not fit into any community, artistic or otherwise. He lived like a monk in his New York apartment and led an almost clandestine creative life, totally uninterested in fame or even recognition.\u201d\n\nIn a recently published book, Saul Leiter: The Centennial Retrospective, Leiter sums up his outlook during his long years of obscurity. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ambitious or driven,\u201d he says, matter-of-factly. \u201cI don\u2019t admire success the way some people do. I was fortunate to fulfil my ambition to be unsuccessful.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Ana, 1950s. Photograph: \u00a9 Saul Leiter Foundation\n\nLike Vivian Maier, the nanny whose secret archive was discovered a few years after her death in 2009, Leiter shot on the streets of Manhattan. Yet while she wandered far and wide, he stayed close to home, never venturing beyond a few blocks\u2019 radius of his apartment on East 10th Street. Unlike William Klein\u2019s frenetic, neon-lit city, or Berenice Abbott\u2019s towering modernist metropolis, Saul Leiter\u2019s New York is an intimately observed world of gesture and detail: luminous, otherworldly and oddly tranquil. Streets and buildings are bathed in soft light and warm colours, his use of reflections, blur and shadow approaching the abstract or dreamlike. People are partially glimpsed in passing cars, or photographed through vertical spaces between buildings or hoardings. Viewed through smeared or steamed-up windows, they sometimes seem like spectral silhouettes.\n\nHe captured the city and its people in all seasons, against brightly painted storefronts in summer sunlight, and enveloped in snow or partially obscured by rain in the harsh New York winter. Often, his subjects are caught in moments of quiet reverie amid, but apart from, the city\u2019s bustle and hum.\n\nView image in fullscreen Pull, c 1960. Photograph: \u00a9 Saul Leiter Foundation\n\n\u201cAs a photographer, he was never seduced by the idea of New York as the mythical city that never stops,\u201d says Morin. \u201cHe was always attuned to the small rather than the big, to the silence rather than the noise. For him, the city revealed itself in the tiny details of everyday life, but he also wanted to somehow peer through the skin of its surface reality to see something else, something ephemeral but full of meaning.\u201d\n\nLeiter\u2019s clandestine creative journey began in 1938, aged 15, when he started painting and sketching in his spare time between school studies. The following year, his mother gave him a Detrola camera, igniting his interest in the medium for which he is now best known, but throughout his life he continued painting. His vast archive contains more than 4,000 abstract pieces and geometric landscapes, mostly watercolours. At the Milton Keynes gallery, the full range of his work will be on display: black and white as well as colour images, fashion photographs, languorously erotic portraits of his longtime partner, Soames Bantry, a former model, and her beautiful friends, as well as his paintings and painted-over photographs.\n\nView image in fullscreen Untitled, undated, gouache and watercolour on paper, one of thousands of paintings Leiter made in his lifetime. Photograph: \u00a9 2023 Saul Leiter Foundation\n\n\u201cI have intentionally mixed everything together rather than arranging the work in different categories,\u201d says Morin. \u201cLeiter did not have the intention to create an oeuvre, but instead he produced all these fragments that continuously grew and came together to form this huge territory \u2013 his unfinished world.\u201d\n\nWhen he arrived in New York as a young man, Leiter slept on park benches before finding a cheap apartment on Perry Street in Greenwich Village. He befriended the abstract expressionist painter Richard Pousette-Dart, who became a formative influence, alongside the photographer Eugene Smith. Throughout this time, Leiter\u2019s aversion to success was already apparent: in the 1950s, he turned down an offer of an exhibition from an important art dealer, Betty Parsons, whose patronage was much sought after by other up-and-coming artists. Later in life, he liked to tell the story of how he was admonished for the smallness of his paintings by the artist Franz Kline, who told him: \u201cIf you only worked big, you would be one of the boys.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen An unpublished image made for Harper\u2019s Bazaar, September 1961. Photograph: \u00a9 2023 Saul Leiter Foundation\n\nLeiter\u2019s temperament was such that he was never going to be one of the boys, but in the late 1950s and throughout the 60s he reluctantly became a fashion photographer in order to survive, as well as finance his more personal work. The images he created for Harper\u2019s Bazaar and later for British magazines such as Nova and Man About Town are captivating in their quiet subversion, but often seem constrained and altogether less atmospheric than his personal work. An exception is a striking image made for Nova, in which he posed Bantry on a stretch of urban wasteground alongside a little boy, both of them intently reading comics against a backdrop of derelict houses. It\u2019s wilfully unglamorous and downbeat, and prefigures the casual, low-key approach of a generation of young, edgy photographers who came of age in the 1980s.\n\nView image in fullscreen Leiter\u2019s \u2018soulmate\u2019, the artist and model Soames Bantry, posed with a small boy for this image published in the October 1866 issue of Nova Photograph: \u00a9 Saul Leiter Foundation\n\nIn the equally mysterious Bantry, Leiter found a soulmate \u2013 someone who shared his lack of interest in fame and was also an avid painter. They met in 1958, when she was newly arrived in New York in search of work as a model. For most of their time together they lived in the same building, but in separate apartments, the walls of his work space covered in her oil paintings of flowers and people. \u201cThey were two independent souls who had no desire to fit in,\u201d says Morin. \u201cThey wanted to be creatively free and to embrace life on their own terms. And, they succeeded.\u201d When Bantry died in 2002 they were living together in her apartment, where Leiter remained, surrounded by her work, until his death in 2013, aged 89.\n\nIt was on the streets surrounding their building that he made the colour photographs for which he is now remembered. Their belated discovery challenged the received history of colour photography in America, given that Leiter began experimenting with the tonal possibilities of colour two decades before the likes of William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, whose embrace of the same in the early 1970s caused such controversy among critics and traditionalists.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018I was fortunate to fulfil my ambition to be unsuccessful\u2019: Leiter in Sicily, c1960. \u00a9 2023 Saul Leiter Foundation\n\nIn the Milton Keynes show, Morin has chosen to give equal prominence to his black and white photographs, which, she says, \u201chave all but disappeared in the myth of Saul Leiter\u201d.\n\nThat myth is as much to do with the wilful nature of his clandestine creative life as the quiet audacity of his colour photography. Although his work had fitfully appeared in various group exhibitions in the 1960 and 70s, Leiter did not have a solo exhibition until 1993, when the Howard Greenberg Gallery in New York featured some of his black and white photographs.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a decade later, though, when the same gallery hosted a show entitled Saul Leiter: Early Color, that his photographs really began to garner attention. A book of the same name, his first monograph, was published the following year, when he was 72. It was greeted as revelatory by a photography world taken by surprise by his very existence. \u201cI used to be unknown and that was very restful and pleasurable,\u201d he told the writer Adam Harrison Levy in 2009. \u201cNow I have become known, and people want to interview me.\u201d\n\nIn Levy\u2019s essay for Saul Leiter: The Centennial Retrospective, he sees a connection between Leiter\u2019s orthodox Jewish upbringing \u2013 he once described himself as a \u201crabbinical ghost\u201d \u2013 and his quietly inquiring approach to photography.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018The incisive moment\u2019: Footprints, c1950 by Saul Leiter. \u00a9 Saul Leiter Foundation\n\n\u201c[Leiter] retained the last vestiges of his Talmudic schooling, where inquiry and the interpretation of texts were taught and fostered. He had absorbed that way of interrogating the world but had transposed it to the visual realm: he saw the streets of New York, and its inhabitants, with the narrative insight of a Talmudic scholar. The streets were his text.\u201d\n\nFor all the attention he received in the last decade of his life, Leiter remains an enigma, a remarkably self-effacing artist who walked to his own beat and went out in search of what Morin calls \u201cthe incisive moment\u201d every day, on the same few streets, for nigh on 60 years.\n\n\u201cI aspired to be unimportant,\u201d he said of his working life as a photographer of the everyday sublime.

You can get in excess of 500 spectators coming to watch.\u201d\n\nGreen said it was no longer just the stereotypical boy racer taking part in the events, and that women and older professionals were also getting involved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everyone from young, new drivers all the way through to professional people who in their normal daily life, you wouldn\u2019t believe they\u2019re out street racing at night,\u201d he said. \u201cThese groups have hundreds of thousands of followers online and we\u2019ll go after spectators, organisers, passengers and drivers.\u201d\n\nMat MacDonald the co-chair of the campaign group Better Streets for Birmingham said drag racing was a \u201cmassive problem\u201d in the city despite the best efforts of authorities.\n\n\u201cIt has been the cause of multiple deaths and serious injuries on our streets, and is a daily source of irritation, misery and fear for communities across the city,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the daytime people are scared to let their kids play outside and at night some roads are openly used as racetracks keeping people awake for hours on end.\u201d\n\nMartin Price, his fellow co-chair, added: \u201cPolice are trying as best as they can but lack the resource to fully clamp down on what can often be large gatherings of people in high-performance cars driving at speed in residential areas.\n\n\u201cLengthy driving bans for people caught speeding would make a big impact in the short term. Ultimately though, streets should be laid out so it is physically impossible to drive like this.\u201d\n\nWest Midlands police have now created the country\u2019s first speed awareness course for street racers, where offenders watch a high-speed crash through a VR headset and hear from someone bereaved by a fatal road collision.\n\nView image in fullscreen A car approaches a stinger in the road placed by the police. Photograph: West Midlands police\n\nDozens of early offenders have been sent on the course to try to dissuade them from street racing before they end up with a criminal record. As the issue becomes a growing problem nationally, other police forces are starting to follow suit.\n\n\u201cIt is becoming a growing concern across the country, and we\u2019ve presented our work to a number of other forces,\u201d said Green. \u201cPeople often say we\u2019re just picking on car enthusiasts, but we\u2019re not talking about people who show their car off in a field here, we\u2019re talking about people who do very dangerous stuff, drivers who are going to kill people on the road.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, teenagers Ben Corfield, 19, and Liberty Charris, 16, were killed in Oldbury in the West Midlands when a car ploughed into a 200-strong crowd who had gathered to watch street racing, also known as car cruising. A 55-year-old man is due in court later this month, charged with two counts of causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nGreen said the force suspected many more people had been killed or seriously injured as a result of organised events, but it was often difficult to prove a street racing event took place.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had events recently where street racers have lost their lives. But people aren\u2019t rushing to tell us that it was a street race \u2013 we just turn up to the aftermath of a horrific accident. Sometimes we either know the car registration or know the victim, and work it out that way,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week, an Audi driver was arrested for allegedly travelling at speeds in excess of 100mph on a dual carriageway while racing with other cars on a Saturday night, while earlier in January footage went viral on social media of 30 to 40 cars travelling dangerously fast on the A47, a key route into Birmingham city centre.\n\nIn recent years, the force has relied on high court injunctions, secured by local councils in the region, which prohibit gatherings of two or more people for the purpose of motor racing, stunts or dangerous driving, to help officers clamp down on it.\n\nA fresh high court bid for an injunction, launched by West Midlands police and four councils in the region, is being heard later this month.\n\nUnder criminal laws against offences such as dangerous driving, police have to witness or see evidence of the offence taking place, whereas the injunctions \u2013 which can also include spectators and organisers \u2013 allow them to intervene before offences are committed.\n\n\u201cWhile it feels like a sledgehammer to crack a nut, it actually allows us to enforce it before they\u2019ve committed criminal offences of dangerous driving, before they put people at risk,\u201d said Green.\n\nPenalties include driving bans, fines of up to \u00a35,000 and people having their cars seized and crushed, as well as up to two years in prison.\n\nGreen said: \u201cI\u2019m at the point now where I\u2019d rather be seen as being over the top, or be accused of targeting car enthusiasts, than have someone die.\u201d"}

On Saturday, Biden handily won more than 95% of the vote in the state that had launched his campaign in 2020. Long-shot candidates Dean Phillips, a congressman from Minnesota, and Marianne Williamson, a self-help author, trailed far behind.\n\nIn two weeks, Donald Trump is expected to capture the win in the Republican primary in the same state, which Biden directly addressed in his statement soon after his victory was confirmed.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign, and set us on the path to winning the Presidency,\u201d he said. \u201cNow in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the Presidency again \u2013 and making Donald Trump a loser \u2013 again.\u201d\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s victory was a foregone conclusion in the state, voter turnout served as a proxy for enthusiasm about his candidacy, especially among the significant Black voting population. Leading up to the primary, there had been some signals he has lost traction among Black voters since 2020: his approval rating among Black adults is 42% in the latest Associated Press-Norc Center for Public Affairs Research poll, a substantial drop from the first year of his presidency.\n\nIn South Carolina, the results were mixed. Democrats touted early voting numbers: \u201cWith results still coming in, Black voters made up approximately 76% of the early vote \u2013 a significant increase over 2020, where Black voters made up 56% of the primary electorate,\u201d said Michael Tyler, the Biden-Harris campaign\u2019s communications director.\n\nBut overall voter turnout was on track to be much lower than previous primary years, indicating that even the high stakes of a Biden-Trump rematch might not be enough to mobilize voters for the incumbent. The campaign is hoping that the recent strong economic indicators will bolster Biden\u2019s low approval rating, fueled by voter hesitations about his handling of the Israel-Gaza war, immigration and other domestic issues.\n\nBut the Phillips campaign, which had just upwards of 2,000 votes, tried to capitalize on the turnout issue anyway.\n\n\u201cI congratulate the President for getting the most votes tonight. But the lack of voter enthusiasm for a Trump-Biden rematch is being reflected in each and every Democratic primary result this election,\u201d Phillips said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cVoters are disappointed that they lack options beyond the choice between a threat to the fabric of the nation and a good man who voters want to pass the baton.\u201d\n\nWhile the national picture has yet to play out more fully, poll workers and state Democrats celebrated a successful election process, and South Carolina\u2019s new status, on Saturday.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The fact that my body was giving me clear and obvious information every month, and that I\u2019d been missing it all that time, came as a shock. When I finally did get pregnant, via IVF, the hormonal savagery of it all was equally arresting. Then, a year after my second child was born, my periods became extremely hard to manage. Over the following couple of years, I also watched my mental health start to do what felt like cartwheels: mostly, I\u2019d be fine, but there\u2019d be weeks when I couldn\u2019t sleep for wild and worrying imaginings, when rage would bubble out of nowhere, or when a sob would always be caught in the back of my throat.\n\nA couple of months ago, I had another shock when I was diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a condition I had never heard of. (I had assumed I was perimenopausal.) How PMDD, also known as severe premenstrual syndrome, works isn\u2019t entirely understood, but it is caused by the ebb and flow of cyclical hormones, such as oestrogen and progesterone, which explains why I feel normal half to three-quarters of the time, but crashingly low, unable to sleep and thoroughly furious for up to 10 days before my period arrives, after which I go back to normal again.\n\nPeople with PMDD have a neurobiological sensitivity to hormonal changes \u2013 we are wired up differently \u2013 rather than a hormonal imbalance. PMDD affects 5-8% of people who menstruate, with symptoms (of which there are more than 100 possibilities, both physical and mental) occurring in the 7-14 days leading up to each period. There are about 14.6 million women aged between 15 and 49 in the UK, so between 730,000 and 1.2m may have PMDD/severe PMS in this country alone.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long PMDD has been a part of my life. I have, since my teens, seen five different therapists and numerous doctors, first for depression (which never felt like the right diagnosis) and later for anxiety. None of them ever asked me about my hormonal cycle, something which a qualitative investigation into PMDD diagnosis, undertaken in 2020, showed is absolutely standard. For many of us, it takes decades to get a diagnosis of PMDD or severe PMS, and sometimes only after misdiagnosis for illnesses like bipolar disorder, or being dismissed completely for years.\n\nI had anxiety, exhaustion, insomnia, weight gain, brain fog, all at random\n\nOver the past four years, I have had multiple appointments \u2013 mainly by telephone \u2013 with six GPs at the busy inner city practice where I\u2019m registered. My symptoms \u2013 which would come and go seemingly at random \u2013 were anxiety, exhaustion, insomnia, brain fog, weight gain and impractically heavy periods; at the same time I had several appointments about joint pain and reflux, which I now know can both also be associated with cyclical hormones and PMDD. Blood tests didn\u2019t show any signs of early perimenopause (granted, they rarely do) and there is no blood or hormone test for PMDD. Although many of my doctors were sympathetic, I was also told that \u201chaving young children is hard and you\u2019re in the thick of it\u201d, and that I could try going to bed earlier, eating better (I\u2019m a cookbook author) and asking my partner to do more (he already was). It wasn\u2019t until I finally had a 20-minute appointment at an NHS menopause clinic, after a nine-month wait, that I was told \u2013 based on the fact that my symptoms only appear in the second half of my cycle and given that my many hormone tests had all been normal \u2013 that I have PMDD.\n\nI\u2019m an anxious person and I\u2019ve known for a long time that my anxiety is far worse just before my period. But, because I hadn\u2019t ever been prompted to track my emotions, pain levels and mental wellbeing alongside my cycle, I hadn\u2019t realised it was all connected to my cyclical hormones. Since it can take a week or two to get a GP appointment, often by the time I spoke to a doctor I\u2019d be OK again and it would be hard to explain how I\u2019d felt just days before. For many women, symptoms worsen as they enter perimenopause and mine have probably been more acute since having IVF, too, and as stress is also an aggravating factor, the pandemic probably didn\u2019t help. But I\u2019ll never know if I\u2019ve always had severe PMS, nor if, had I known, I might have been less hard on myself for failing to pull myself together over years of trying.\n\nClearly, the NHS is struggling under the weight of its responsibilities and lack of funding and some will argue that there are other areas where its limited budget should be spent first. But PMDD is, for many people, very serious. It is life altering and, for some, life threatening. It is a huge risk factor for suicide, with one recent global study suggesting that up to 34% of people with PMDD have attempted suicide, 51% experience self-harm and 87% experience passive suicidal ideation. Another study found that 17% of subjects reported having lost a job due to PMDD, 57% had lost a partner, and 43% reported problems with parenting. Just over 10% of respondents said they felt completely unable to parent during the worst parts of their cycle.\n\nGiven all this, why does it seem so hard to get a diagnosis? There are three main reasons. First, GPs have historically been poorly trained to recognise PMDD or severe PMS (which is not their fault). Dr Louise Newson, who founded the Balance app and runs a menopause clinic, says: \u201cMany GPs, including myself, have little or no training in conditions affecting female hormones, which includes PMDD. Often women will discuss how they are feeling with their doctor who may dismiss or even trivialise their symptoms as they are not aware of PMDD. There\u2019s no blood test to confirm it and if the psychological symptoms are taken in isolation, they can be mistaken for general anxiety or clinical depression, which leads to missed diagnoses and missed opportunities to give women appropriate advice, support and treatment.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018For years, struggling women have been told it\u2019s all in their own heads\u2019: Rebecca Seal. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer\n\nNick Panay, a consultant gynaecologist at Queen Charlotte\u2019s Hospital and professor of practice at Imperial College London, agrees. \u201cThe training in this area really needs to be beefed up \u2013 to the best of my knowledge, there isn\u2019t a GP training module on management of severe PMS or PMDD.\u201d Panay is chairman of the advocacy charity the National Association for Premenstrual Syndromes (Naps) and has created a set of diagnosis and treatment guidelines for GPs and patients (a simplified version of one he helped design with the Royal College of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians). The first thing it recommends is to get anyone suspected of having severe PMS/PMDD to keep a cycle and symptom diary for a couple of months, after which diagnosis can be pretty straightforward. \u201cWe distributed more than 10,000 copies of our guidelines to practices, but you can take a horse to water\u2026\u201d says Panay. \u201cThere are many GPs out there who are excellent and understand this condition extremely well. But others don\u2019t have a particular interest in this or don\u2019t have the time. It\u2019s a postcode lottery. It depends on which GP you see and also whether there is a clinic that you can be referred to if your symptoms are severe.\u201d\n\nDr Melanie Davis-Hall is a GP and medical director of the Lowdown, a women\u2019s health review platform on which users can share experiences of contraception, treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis, and of trying to conceive. Conversations with patients on the site so often featured PMDD that it led her to start developing short-form educational material for doctors who use the British Medical Association\u2019s BMJ Learning online, having discovered there was nothing there on PMS or PMDD at all. Short-form content is popular among GPs because \u201cmost continual professional development is self-funded and in your own time,\u201d she says. A 2023 BMJ survey also made clear that GPs are currently under extraordinary levels of pressure, with stress up 11% since 2019, and workload increases far higher than in other countries. Although tempting, urging already overwhelmed GPs to do more with what little time and energy they have isn\u2019t necessarily the answer.\n\nWhether PMDD should be treated as a gynaecological, endocrine or psychiatric issue is a second part of the puzzle. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is the name favoured in the US, where the condition has an entry in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5), and there it is more likely to be treated by a psychiatrist. In the UK, many doctors prefer to call it severe PMS and first-line treatment is usually via GPs and gynaecologists, often involving hormonal medications, although cognitive behavioural therapy is also recommended, as are antidepressants, but used only on the worst days of the cycle.\n\nIdeally, it should probably be treated as a mixture of all three. But psychiatric services are already over-stretched, says Professor Michael Craig, who treats the most serious cases of severe PMS and PMDD at the Maudsley Hospital in south London. \u201cAdult mental health services are in a mess and have been for some time, so psychiatrists are not desperate to take on a new condition while they are being forced to firefight other very acute cases,\u201d he says.\n\nAs a gynaecologist who is also a psychiatrist, he has unique expertise, which is why he set up the Female Hormone Clinic at the Maudsley 15 years ago to take referrals from all over the country. \u201cI think it\u2019s very difficult for either speciality to fully grasp what the other one is doing,\u201d Craig says, \u201cso it\u2019s an area that has fallen between specialities. Within the field of gynaecology, there are some people who are more psychologically minded and more suited to managing conditions such as PMDD. But I think if you spoke to the majority of gynaecologists, it would not be their preferred sort of thing to be treating.\u201d\n\nThe name PMDD is gaining ground in the UK, particularly among patients. Whether this is a good thing or not is up for debate, as Eleanor Morgan, a psychotherapist and author of Hormonal: A Conversation About Women\u2019s Bodies, Mental Health and Why We Need to be Heard, says: \u201cIt\u2019s undoubtedly true that having a term, or a diagnostic framework, can help someone make sense of their experience. It can make people feel less isolated, by the fact of knowing that others feel the same and the validation that comes from there being a proper explanation for years of minimised, dismissed and misunderstood distress. The communities, particularly online, of women with PMDD also provide validation and a sense of being seen \u2013 which is therapeutic in itself.\n\nThe online communities of women with PMDD provide validation and a sense of being seen \u2013 which is therapeutic in itself\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with people who\u2019ve received several different diagnoses over the course of their lives,\u201d she continues, \u201csome validating, others deeply oppressive. My worry is that, when people position \u2013 or, in the inherent power dynamic of clinician-patient, are encouraged to accept and treat \u2013 their distress as something wrong or faulty in the system, they jettison their sense of agency.\u201d\n\nFor some patients, naming it as a \u201cdisorder\u201d is an unhelpful pathologisation of what they\u2019re going through, while for others, because of pre-existing biases around either mental health or hormonal health, they may prefer either a more psychiatric-sounding name, or less of one. (I\u2019ll admit that initially I quite liked having a name for it that sounded more serious than plain old PMS and was a bit annoyed when, during an appointment, a gynaecologist dismissed the term PMDD as an \u201cunnecessary Americanisation\u201d.)\n\nThe third reason PMDD is so poorly understood and so often under or misdiagnosed, is that although it affects trans and non-binary people, too, it\u2019s classified as a women\u2019s health problem and as such isn\u2019t a major area of research or education. Women didn\u2019t even get their own health strategy until 2022 and to the disappointment of many PMDD advocates and practitioners, it only mentioned PMS once. \u201cWomen\u2019s health is historically under researched and underfunded,\u201d says Caroline Criado Perez, who researches data bias in medicine and science and is author of Invisible Women and a Substack newsletter of the same name. \u201cAnd the story you hear again and again from women is that they have been struggling for years with everything from endometriosis to cancer, but they are told it\u2019s all in their head, that they\u2019re actually just struggling to recover from having given birth, or that everyone feels this kind of pain.\u201d\n\nClaudine Domoney, a gynaecologist specialising in the treatment of PMDD/severe PMS, and Chelsea & Westminster\u2019s gynaecology clinical effectiveness lead, agrees. \u201cI hope that the expansion of interest in menopause and perimenopause will then extend into PMS and PMDD,\u201d she says, citing the Davina McCall effect on menopause awareness. \u201cEspecially because women who have significant premenstrual symptoms often will have more symptoms around the perimenopause.\u201d She is frustrated at the lack of knowledge in general practice. \u201cThe absolute minimum that we should expect from a big practice is that hormonal health \u2013 peri- or menopausal or premenstrual \u2013 should be addressed by somebody within it. There just needs to be somebody who is sent out on a study day once every two years. It doesn\u2019t have to be a doctor, it could be a nurse practitioner, and then people would be in a space in which they can be heard.\u201d\n\nHow to treat PMDD is the final question. As Davis-Hall notes, doctors are trained to provide medication, but some women find lifestyle changes helpful, too. \u201cIt takes a lot to holistically go through your life, looking at underlying stress, diet, exercise, alcohol and so on \u2013 and see what could be changed for the better. There are some amazing GPs who are less time pressured, but you\u2019re not usually going to get that in a 10-minute consultation, so you potentially have to go and do your own research.\u201d And that\u2019s particularly hard when you feel like crap half the time.\n\nI still haven\u2019t decided whether I\u2019ll take medication. My current options are a particular type of combined birth-control pill or to have a progesterone coil fitted, plus possibly an HRT oestrogen gel, or to take antidepressants for 5-10 days each month. Although it\u2019s severe PMS, I\u2019m at the less severe end and in a way, what I wanted most was just to find out what was going on in my brain and my body, which I was pretty sure wasn\u2019t just down to having small children.\n\nWhile I\u2019d love to magic it all away, each medication comes with potential side effects and downsides\n\nAnd, while I\u2019d love to magic it all away, each medication comes with potential side effects and downsides. Plus, because it\u2019s a highly variable condition, with so many possible symptoms, treatment tends to be very individualised, with a certain amount of trial and error, too. While it\u2019s not a solution, just knowing what\u2019s going on when I feel disproportionate anger boiling over, or feelings of being overwhelmed engulfing me, has been more helpful than I could have imagined.\n\nFor now, I\u2019m experimenting with upping my magnesium, calcium, vitamin D and B, interventions which have a small amount of evidence behind them. (Drinking less alcohol in the second half of my cycle also seems to help.) Some people find supplementing with the herb vitex agnus castus is helpful and, again, there\u2019s some clinical evidence that it can be, but as research is fairly limited and studies so far have been small, we don\u2019t yet know exactly why or at what dosage. And, as Domoney says, \u201cWe probably won\u2019t ever know, because no one is going to spend money looking at it, because no one is going to make any money out of it, at least not until women\u2019s health is far higher up the agenda than it currently is.\u201d\n\nFor information and help, contact pms.org.uk; thelowdown.com; or call the Samaritans on 116 123\n\nBe Bad, Better: How Not Trying So Hard Will Set You Free by Rebecca Seal is published by Souvenir Press at \u00a314.99.

Now, follow-up Newborn: Running Away, Breaking from the Past, Building a New Family finds her eyeing the future. Having spent a few months living on a houseboat, the 43-year-old now resides on terra firma in Sheffield with her husband and their three-year-old son.\n\nWhat made you want to write about motherhood?\n\nLet\u2019s be frank, I\u2019m not the first author to have a baby and then immediately need to write about it, but I had these vast, complicated feelings about myself and motherhood and how I was brought up. Newborn felt like a natural progression from Lowborn, the culmination of what happens after you \u201cescape\u201d \u2013 I use the word very much in inverted commas: you don\u2019t really escape but you move forward. How do you then build a happy, healthy, functional life of love and stability around you?\n\nYou became very ill in the middle of writing the book, with a rare autoimmune disease that made it hard to breathe. How did that experience shape it?\n\nIt\u2019s not being dramatic to say that I really thought I might die, and so the book became a little legacy to leave behind for my son and my husband. I wanted to crystallise this complicated, beautiful family that we created, which for me was a miraculous gift because I\u2019d been told to expect that I would never have a loving partner, that I wouldn\u2019t be a good mother.\n\nTold by whom?\n\nI grew up with the narrative that working-class mothers were the worst of the worst, and then I was told directly by people quite often that with my background, having a child was going to be difficult. When Lowborn came out there was a really long review on Amazon from a woman who said \u2013 in capital letters \u2013 do not have children, please, and if you do, refer yourself to extreme psychiatric maternal care. At the time, I thought I was infertile but we were still trying for a baby, and I was just heartbroken.\n\nIt\u2019s still very common for me to do panels with three writers from Oxbridge, so I\u2019ll never feel totally comfortable\n\nAs a society we\u2019ve been slower to acknowledge classism than other prejudices, and the publishing industry is no exception. What makes you optimistic for change?\n\nWhen I started out, there just weren\u2019t that many working-class voices. If I hadn\u2019t been such a novelty, I\u2019m not sure my career would have had quite as much momentum, but there are a lot of brilliant working-class writers now, like Graeme Armstrong, who was on the Granta [Best of Young British Novelists] list.\n\nYour voice has helped shaped the conversation. Do you feel powerful when you sit down to write?\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever quite get over that feeling of imposter syndrome. It\u2019s still very common for me to do panels with three writers from Oxbridge, so I\u2019m never going to feel totally comfortable. Where I do feel powerful is with my family and with the life that I\u2019ve created, which writing has allowed me to build. This feels the right balance to me \u2013 that slight discomfort in the creative space is actually quite valuable.\n\nIf you could wave a magic wand and do one thing to make Britain more equitable, what would that be?\n\nCan it be two? Universal basic income just makes sense. We\u2019re a vastly unequal society and there\u2019s really no reason for that. And the other thing is that I would heavily, heavily invest in social and affordable housing. Those are the things that cause the greatest sense of marginalisation. If you don\u2019t have a secure, safe home it is really hard to build the foundations of any sort of life, and if all your energy is spent worrying about every penny, it\u2019s so grinding and exhausting you can\u2019t possibly be expected to make your life better.\n\nYou\u2019re taking a break from memoir to write two thrillers. What motivated that decision?\n\nI\u2019ve always found writing helpful and therapeutic. It\u2019s been a way to effectively make gold from the shit, you know? But as wonderful as it is being able to turn everything into material, it also means you\u2019re always an observer in your own life. I just wanted to be able to live more in the present. I also miss the joyride of novels. There are so many ethical concerns about writing your own life, and you spend so much time analysing and deconstructing everything, whereas with fiction, you literally just make it up.\n\nYou lived in Prague during the pandemic. What was that like?\n\nThere were armed guards on the streets during lockdown and the fine for breaking the rules was equivalent to the cost of an apartment. But it is just an astoundingly beautiful place. Even when I talk about it I get a bit cheerful because every street is magnificent. If I had been well, we\u2019d have stayed, but by the time we left I was spending 90% of the time in bed, and gave every ounce of energy I had to my son. How unbelievably lucky and privileged were we to be able to come home and access the NHS?\n\nYou\u2019ve since been diagnosed with a second autoimmune condition. How has that affected your life?\n\nI have to take a very low-dose chemotherapy drug and build in rest but I have a fairly good quality of life. Unfortunately it is an illness where people die earlier than they\u2019re meant to, so it changes your perspective. I\u2019ve really had to evaluate what is happiness, what I want my creative practice to be, how I want to use my time and my energy, and what brings me joy \u2013 and for that I\u2019m grateful. External validation is something you need so badly when you come from a very marginalised place, and I was always driven, driven, driven. I could have spent years chasing after things that I don\u2019t really care about on a deeper level.\n\nYou\u2019re an incredibly optimistic person but it\u2019s a lot to deal with. What reliably picks you up?\n\nThe joke in our house is that a slice of toast is what I always need. Food has always been a great pleasure, but these days it\u2019s often just my kid. Every time I look at his little laughing face, life is OK.\n\nHis childhood is already so different to your own. Do you ever worry that he might grow up too sheltered?\n\nChildhood is meant to be cushioned and sheltered. It shouldn\u2019t be that you have to show resilience when you\u2019re six or seven. If my son comes out of his childhood into his teens believing the world is just a generous, warm, kind place then I will consider myself to have done a very good job."}

The final resting place for the city\u2019s dead will soon be overshadowed by tower blocks for those who survived. Bright yellow cranes jut into the skyline on the next hillside, slowly birthing a cluster of concrete skeletons, new government housing for some of the hundreds of thousands who lost their homes when deadly earthquakes struck southern Turkey and northern Syria last February.\n\n\u201cNo one can bring back what was lost, as we lost everything,\u201d said \u0130sa Akbaba, who lost seven members of his extended family along with his home.\n\n\u0130sa gently helped his mother, Suat, navigate the muddy hillside leading to the graves of his elder sister, S\u0131d\u0131ka, and his younger brother, Musa, pictures of their smiling faces carved into the headstones. Suat dabbed a little red nail polish, her daughter\u2019s favourite, on S\u0131d\u0131ka\u2019s grave, as she wailed with grief and kissed their gravestones.\n\nTuesday 6 February will mark one year since the earthquakes wrenched them from their homes and entombed S\u0131d\u0131ka and Musa in the rubble \u2013 two among the 50,783 people estimated to have died in southern Turkey, with thousands more still classified as missing and three million displaced.\n\nThe destruction spanned an area almost the size of Germany, filling whole cities with mountains of rubble and causing an estimated $148.8bn in damage, according to a report from a Turkish parliamentary inquiry \u2013 almost 10% of GDP. Hatay province, where Antakya sits, endured some of the worst losses, with almost half its population displaced and the largest share of the death toll.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan toured the destruction and made a series of bold promises for a swift cleanup and fast reconstruction. \u201cWe will rebuild these buildings within one year and will hand them back to citizens,\u201d he said, just four days after the earthquakes struck.\n\nView image in fullscreen Downtown Antakya, one-year after the devastating earthquake. Photograph: David Lombeida/The Observer\n\nErdo\u011fan promised his citizens that 319,000 new homes would be built by February, with the same amount constructed this year.\n\nA spokesperson for the president\u2019s office said in late January that \u201cthe construction of a total of 307,000 houses has started\u201d. Without clarifying the specifics for Hatay, they added: \u201cThe delivery of a total of 46,000 houses \u2026 has started gradually.\u201d\n\nNo matter how long it takes, the Akbabas will not be eligible \u2013 they rented their now-destroyed apartment. They will be forced to wait for private construction and the slim chance of finding somewhere they can afford.\n\nFor nine months after the earthquakes, the Akbabas mourned the loss of 23 members of their extended family from a tent next to their destroyed apartment block, among the ruins of the city that was once their home. In the hot summer they sheltered under mosquito nets and as winter approached they were grateful to stay together even as they shivered in the open air.\n\nThen one rainy night last November, local officials suddenly ejected them from the makeshift camp, forcing the family into separate container houses in clusters dotted on Antakya\u2019s outskirts. Where their former building once stood is now a sandy pit, as construction workers dig an area to build the foundations of a new tower in its place.\n\nThe Akbabas\u2019 suffering remains frozen in time. \u201cOur pain is still fresh,\u201d said \u0130sa.\n\nSuat quickly grew to like her new one-bedroom container home, in a camp with streets named after flowers, even though she agreed to move in only because its proximity to the graveyard meant she could visit her deceased children every week.\n\nView image in fullscreen A clock near the city centre of Antakya is stuck one year later on the time the earthquake struck. Photograph: David Lombeida/The Observer\n\n\u0130sa resented the family being split up and was increasingly fearful about when the authorities might decide to eject them from the container camps as they did from their tent. Working in construction brought him regular employment, he said, although he complained that some companies involved in the building boom had lacked the money to pay him, as Turkey\u2019s economic crisis rippled through the industry.\n\nLong the historic jewel and largest city in Hatay, Turkey\u2019s southernmost province, Antakya has been emptied by the earthquakes of all but its most determined or impoverished residents. The ancient city is now reduced to large empty stretches where entire neighbourhoods of rubble have been cleared away and where anyone who can afford to has fled. The clock tower at the entrance to the town, surrounded by empty ground dotted with shards of concrete, remains stuck on the time the first tremor struck.\n\nBillboards displaying images of gleaming restoration obscure the slow reconstruction work at the sites of crumbling ancient mosques, bathhouses and covered markets. The UN has even resorted to crowdfunding to raise money to restore some key sites of cultural heritage across the earthquake zone, a sign of the scale of the challenge that still lies ahead.\n\nFor Kenan and Sedat Kadde, who run a business making marble gravestones and countertops at the edge of the city, the earthquake created a grim business opportunity. Three months after the earthquakes struck, Kenan noticed a sudden spike in the demand for gravestones as the city\u2019s residents emptied their savings to mourn their dead. The constant flood of orders for headstones continues to engulf them, with Kenan estimating they manufacture four more each day.\n\n\u201cThe earthquake became a reason to work,\u201d he said, ruefully. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to pray for: the souls of the dead, more business, or just to be thankful that we\u2019re alive.\u201d\n\nThe main artery leading to Antakya city centre, where shops once lined the streets, is now devoid of life. The only sign that people could one day return are the rows of posters obscuring pits and towering dredging equipment, bearing offers of interest-free payment plans next to pictures of austere cement-and-glass four-storey tower blocks. Even the images on the posters show few people.\n\nI don\u2019t want to underestimate the state, but if anyone will do the rebuilding here, it will be the people of Antakya\n\nThe exclusive new housing in the images is part of a pilot project intended to spearhead the rebirth of Antakya, once a thriving multicultural city of 200,000 people that has been inhabited since at least the year 300BC, where churches, mosques and synagogues sprung up among the orange and olive groves that line fertile Hatay province.\n\nThe vision for the city\u2019s renewal, a masterplan designed by a consortium of international architectural firms spearheaded by Britain\u2019s Foster + Partners, offers something markedly different to Antakya\u2019s past.\n\nSedat Kadde was sceptical about the rebuilding efforts and neither he nor his brother said they had any interest in buying one of the new apartments despite the offer of government loans.\n\n\u201cThe aim of this project is to push poor people out of town,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the point is to rebuild the centre for the rich and to leave the poor aside, it would be better not to do it at all.\u201d\n\nImages released last year from the Turkey Design Council (TDC), the organisation overseeing the reconstruction in Antakya, which included 4,900 houses, show sleek brick and glass designs with open boulevards and imported trees \u2013 a projection of a new city that locals fear will price them out. The TDC declined to reveal the budget for the project, stating this would be revealed to the public \u201cwhen the project is completed and the expenses are clarified\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not holding out hope for this,\u201d said hotelier G\u00f6khan Tuneba\u015f, inspecting the images released by the TDC. \u201cI don\u2019t want to underestimate the state, but if anyone will do the rebuilding here, it will be the people of Antakya.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen After the earthquake, Isa and his extended family lived in tents outside the collapsed apartment building that used to be their home in Antakya. Photograph: David Lombeida/The Observer\n\n\u201cRemember, they said all of this will be renewed within a year and people haven\u2019t received those homes yet.\u201d\n\nTuneba\u015f was on the verge of tears, having just returned to the boutique hotel he manages in central Antakya for the first time since it reopened last November, after one wing was destroyed in the earthquake. The hotel is now operational again, housing Tuneba\u015f as well as a dozen guests involved in reconstruction in the immediate area, its brightly lit coffee shop and elegant interior a stark contrast to the derelict buildings and building works directly outside.\n\nThe reopening was meant to provide hope for the city\u2019s future, but Tuneba\u015f doubted change could happen fast. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect Antakya to be back on its feet for at least another five years,\u201d he said.\n\nMustafa \u00d6z\u00e7elik, head of Hatay\u2019s chamber of architects \u2013 a union often critical of the state \u2013 raised concerns that reconstruction was already under way without a full examination of why so many buildings in Antakya had crumbled in last year\u2019s powerful quakes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no information given to the local population, no explanation about lessons learned,\u201d he said. \u201cSo all of these pleasant images can be good if they mean the original communities can live here again. But if this urban renewal project just results in people leaving, it\u2019s a bad thing, despite appearances.\u201d\n\nThe masterplan for the city\u2019s rebirth, said \u00d6z\u00e7elik, remains little more than fantasy, given the slow pace of renewal outside the area earmarked for the pilot project. Local authorities had initially allowed for some feedback for the plans from the chamber of architects and other local organisations, he added, before complaining that listening to their responses would slow reconstruction.\n\nView image in fullscreen Fencing displays reconstruction plans in Antakya. Photograph: David Lombeida/The Observer\n\n\u201cIn reality, this process didn\u2019t take long, it\u2019s just that the government was in a hurry because of the local elections this March,\u201d he said.\n\nFoster + Partners said it was \u201cstill in the process of defining our overall vision\u201d and that its \u201cobjective for the masterplan is to retain the spirit of the town\u2019s pre-earthquake characteristics\u201d, but that the plans had been rushed due to urgent need.\n\nThe TDC pointed to consultations with local architectural groups and said that designs of some of the new buildings would incorporate elements of those that existed before the earthquakes.\n\n\u201cPreserving these details ensures that residents do not feel alienated from the area,\u201d it said.\n\nFor lifelong residents of Antakya, such as the Akbabas, the reconstruction is simply a bitter reminder that shiny new buildings can\u2019t bring back the people that once made their city so vibrant. Like many who stayed to live among the ruins, they wonder who might be able to afford the new tower blocks and whether the joyful spirit associated with Antakya can survive its greatest blow in centuries.\n\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s all demolished, it\u2019s still our neighbourhood,\u201d said Isa. \u201cSome of what was lost will never come back. So many of our neighbours left.\u201d"}

Ignatius Sancho, actor, writer, composer, the first man of African descent to vote in Britain, speech still quick upon his lips, sits for Thomas Gainsborough in Bath. A young man, half-smiling, but with care on his brow, poses for John Singleton Copley in London. Francis Barber, servant and cherished companion to Samuel Johnson, holds his beautiful head high in Joshua Reynolds\u2019s Leicester Square studio. Barber will be Dr Johnson\u2019s heir.\n\nEvery sitter in every great painting is Black (including Kerry James Marshall\u2019s contemporary imagining of Scipio Moorhead, an enslaved African American artist whose life and work are known only through the fleeting praise of a 1773 poem). A whole gallery of Black subjects: this has never happened at the Royal Academy before. It is an ideal start to the most dramatic, enthralling and radical exhibition to jolt the RA out of its 256-year history.\n\nView image in fullscreen Portrait of a Man, probably Francis Barber, c1770 by Joshua Reynolds. \u00a9 Hickey-Robertson, Houston\n\nFor the explicit aim of this show, the curators say, is to explore how deeply the effects of colonialism have permeated the RA and its past, while presenting the actual experiences of Black and Brown people in those centuries. So Gainsborough\u2019s portrait hangs near one of Sancho\u2019s own coruscating letters: \u201cI am Sir an Affrican \u2013 with two ffs \u2013 if you please.\u201d And Turner\u2019s paintings of tumultuous oceans, in which so many lives would be lost on horrific transatlantic slave voyages, appear alongside Ellen Gallagher\u2019s apparently abstract paintings, in which tiny details prove to be drowning limbs and faces.\n\nOn the opposite wall, Frank Bowling\u2019s enormous Middle Passage from 1970 tells the tale again in blood red and burning gold, the tragic theme reprised in the faint outlines of Africa and America held in that staggering force field of paint.\n\nThe historical art is judiciously selected to shock. Johann Zoffany\u2019s 1769 portrait of the Young family got up in frivolous fancy dress, Sir William \u2013 governor of Dominica, enslaver \u2013 sawing away at a cello in the centre, positions an enslaved Black boy right next to the blondest and most pale-skinned Young scion, who looks angelically upwards for outrageous contrast. Copley\u2019s portrait of Mary and Elizabeth Royall, daughters of a slaver in Antigua, gives only the smallest hint of their background in the Antiguan hummingbird supposedly alighting on Mary\u2019s tiny white hand.\n\nAnd before anyone starts to imagine that Reynolds, the RA\u2019s first president, was an unqualified abolitionist, look at his soaring portrait of the future George IV in silver satin and blue velvet suffering his garments to be intimately adjusted by a Black servant whose face, of course, we cannot see.\n\nIn Reynolds\u2019s portrait, George IV suffers his garments to be intimately adjusted by a Black servant whose face, of course, we cannot see\n\nA mahogany paint box of the kind used by both Reynolds and Turner appears much later in the show, lying in a period glass case. In fact, it is a superbly mordant mockup by Keith Piper, founding member of the pioneering 1980s BLK Art Group, each pan of pigment classified \u2013 as if for a British overseer \u2013 in minute gradations of dark-to-light skin colour.\n\nEach gallery has a different atmosphere and theme, choreographed for constant syncopation. A room of quietly beautiful prints and watercolours travels from India to Tahiti through changing time schemes. Another juxtaposes 18th-century paintings of the Caribbean as a perfect paradise of peace and plenty, all social and racial equality, with Karen McLean\u2019s epigrammatic 2010 installation titled Primitive Matters: Huts. Shifting photographic projections of vast houses in Trinidad flicker over wooden shacks no bigger than the fragments of parquet from which they are made. Wealth overshadows poverty; grandeur slithers over humble scale.\n\nView image in fullscreen Middle Passage, 1970 by Frank Bowling. Photograph: National Gallery of Canada \u00a9 Frank Bowling. All Rights Reserved, DACS 2024\n\nIsaac Julien\u2019s film Lessons of the Hour plays in a gallery lined with velvet drapes. The American abolitionist and escaped slave Frederick Douglass, played by Ray Fearon, gives his visionary lecture to an audience of white Victorians over in Edinburgh. On a piano in that film you see a small edition of Hiram Powers\u2019s sculpture The Greek Slave, a nubile nude that was insanely famous across America in the 19th century. In one version, Powers swapped the chains for manacles, in an allusion to the growing anti-slavery movement. But several variations are on show in Entangled Pasts, so that you can see the different stages of his propaganda.\n\nThis is creative, absorbing and highly intelligent: ideas embodied through art itself rather than via the deadening wall texts that instruct us round similar shows. For there have been other such institutional self-interrogations of late, including last year\u2019s rehang of Tate Britain in the light of its foundations in colonial slavery.\n\nNothing in that reorganisation, however, is quite so devastatingly direct as the triangulation of three works in the gallery here devoted to whiteness. This subject goes in many directions, from images of cotton fields where enslaved people laboured sometimes from the age of barely six, like Frederick Douglass, to paintings such as William Mulready\u2019s The Toy Seller (1863), where a Black man gives a weary side-eye to a whiny little white child too frightened to look at him from Mummy\u2019s arms.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Toy Seller, c1863 by William Mulready. \u00a9 National Gallery of Ireland\n\nInstantly you look with new eyes at the vast expanse of white cotton extending all the way down the table of postprandial chaps in Frederick William Elwell\u2019s portrait of the Royal Academy\u2019s 1938 selection and hanging committee. And at the hideous painting of two white-skinned, redheaded girls struggling to cover their nakedness with white cloths against prying eyes in Frank Dicksee\u2019s 1892 Startled. Dicksee, future RA president, gave a lecture to his students: \u201cOur ideal of beauty must be the white man\u2019s.\u201d\n\nDirectly opposite hangs a pristine white sheet, pegged to a line. A black steam iron is chained to an ironing board below \u2013 its shape suddenly chiming, in mind, with those terrifying diagrams of slave ships. This installation, by the great nonagenarian artist Betye Saar, born in California in 1926, is so searingly concise you scarcely notice the KKK monogram embroidered on the sheet.\n\nView image in fullscreen Lubaina Himid\u2019s \u2018joyous yet poignant\u2019 Naming the Money, 2004. Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nLubaina Himid\u2019s lifesize cutouts of enslaved Africans forced to work as dog trainers, dancers, toy-makers and ceramicists, for instance, when shipped over to 18th-century Bristol, are given two full galleries in which to spread their joyous yet poignant presence (the tragic labels on their backs for once fully visible). They speak directly to other figures all through this exhibition, but also to Tavares Strachan\u2019s lifesize recreation of The Last Supper in black and gold in the RA courtyard outside, all the parts played by heroes of Black history.\n\nA key to these figures is supplied; and it remains, alas, necessary. Which goes to a question almost imperceptibly raised at the very start of this show. For Dorothy Price and her exceptional team of female curators have included Marshall\u2019s imaginary portrait of Scipio Moorhead for more than its sheer quality alone. Which of us has heard of this vanished painter? Who can say for certain that this really is Francis Barber in Joshua Reynolds\u2019s portrait? And why don\u2019t we have any real idea who John Singleton Copley is painting? Pay attention through this show and art will challenge history: who ignored the humanity, and the identity, of all these long-lost people?"}

A group of dancers performed choreography while sitting in chairs and others held up signs that said \"Senior Swifties,\" \"Chiefs For The Win\" and \"Touchdown Kansas City!\"\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t understand the music, or the words. I didn\u2019t care \u2018cause it was for the Chiefs. So it just made it fun,\" Jackie Canaan, one of the dancers, told USA TODAY Sports. During the interview, she wore a No. 87 jersey T-shirt for tight end Travis Kelce, Swift's boyfriend.\n\n\"You really have to move. It looks, like, easy. But it\u2019s a little tough when you\u2019re first starting it,\" Lory Moxter, another dancer who sported a red Chiefs sweatshirt during the Zoom interview, said. \"And I think everybody enjoys it and we all get into it and really give it a go.\"\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nConnie Chevalier is the life enrichment director at the Primrose Retirement Community and leads a group of members in chair Zumba every morning. She was watching the Chiefs' wild-card game against the Miami Dolphins and saw the pop superstar joining the crowd at Arrowhead Stadium in the dance. Chevalier turned to Google and found the \"Swag Surfin'\" song by F.L.Y., from which the dance originated. She decided to use it for a routine. She posted the Cheerleaders doing the dance on Facebook ahead of the divisional round and it took off.\n\n\"We\u2019re just like flabbergasted, we don\u2019t know how this happened to us,\" Chevalier said of the video's popularity, noting that she didn't even know what the term \"viral\" meant when media started reaching out. \"\u2026 We just got to be one of them lucky people that we enjoy life and we got noticed, huh?\"\n\nResidents at Primrose love to watch sports, including the Chiefs and the MLB's Kansas City Royals. Chevalier said she took her first Zumba class about 10 years ago and she wanted to combine the fun energy of the dance exercise with the community's love for the Chiefs.\n\n\"They\u2019re just huge fans. They\u2019re always watching (Chiefs games), so it was a no-brainer to pull this together for them to get pumped up and truly be cheerleaders,\" she said. \"... It just makes it more special for all of us to know that we\u2019re part of it. We actually feel part of it.\"\n\nChevalier said she is going to teach the group one more routine for the season. She is planning to release the video Thursday before the Chiefs take on the San Francisco 49ers in an attempt to lay another brick in their dynasty.\n\nLast season, Chevalier taught the Cheerleaders a routine to Tech N9ne's \"Red Kingdom\" when Patrick Mahomes and company marched to Super Bowl 57 and beat the Philadelphia Eagles for their second title in four years.\n\nAfter a rocky start this season, many of the residents were doubtful at Kansas City's prospects of a repeat championship. But Moxter kept the faith.\n\n\"Everybody here said, 'Oh, I don\u2019t think.' I said, 'They\u2019re winning. They\u2019re winning,'\" she said. \"And there\u2019s no other way to go.\"\n\nBesides teaching dance to a group of the residents, Chevalier makes signs for the less mobile members of the community. She found pictures of signs that fans brought to Arrowhead Stadium and copied them on poster board. One of her favorites was, \"Is Taylor Here?\"\n\n\"I thought that was funny,\" she said.\n\nCanaan said that her grandkids are fans of the 12-time Grammy winner and that's how she got hip. Chevalier said that the Cheerleaders mostly listen to \"golden oldies or classic country,\" but they have used Swift's music in a few of their routines.\n\n\"She\u2019s got some good music out there,\" she said.\n\n\"Everyone really gets in the mood to do everything and it just gets everybody together,\" Moxter added, \"and I think it\u2019s a fun thing for everyone.\"\n\nChevalier, Canaan and Moxter all enjoy her music and also watching Swift and Kelce's love story unfold.\n\n\"In the end, it\u2019s love and if they\u2019re in love, then oh my gosh, yeah, we\u2019re happy for them, very happy for them,\" Chevalier said. \"I really do hope that she does find love and he finds love, and maybe they are gonna be the couple. Just cause they\u2019re both superstars doesn\u2019t really mean anything. They\u2019re just normal people, really truly normal people. Everybody wants to be loved and to love.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s just that we hope the best for both of them and hope it works out that it is true love, really,\" Moxter chimed in.\n\n\"If not, enjoy it while you got it. Enjoy one another and if it\u2019s not meant to be permanent, that\u2019s OK,\" Canaan offered. \"Have a good time, enjoy one another. We\u2019re sure liking it.\""}

Currently members can only book with points or cash.\n\nLate last year, the airline completed fleet-wide upgrades to its Wi-Fi equipment to increase bandwidth and data speeds on flights. It also introduced a new perk for A-List Preferred members: two free premium drinks per flight.\n\nLast year, Southwest also introduced new features on its app, website and airport kiosks allowing customers to track their luggage, enroll themselves in free same-day standby and more."}

Nikki Haley, who asked why the fellow Republican presidential candidate won't debate her.\n\n\"Oh my God, it's her, the woman who was in charge of security on Jan. 6. It's Nancy Pelosi,\" Johnson's Trump said. Johnson has played Trump on the NBC sketch comedy show since 2021.\n\nHaley then got a question of her own, in reference to comments she made at a December town hall.\n\nHaley at the time was asked what caused the Civil War by an attendee and responded that \"the cause of the Civil War was basically how the government was going to run. The freedoms and what people could and couldn\u2019t do.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Haley offered a different answer.\n\n\"I was just curious, what would you say was the main cause of the Civil War, and do you think it starts with an 's' and ends with a 'lavery'?\" asked Edebiri.\n\n\"Yep, I probably should've said that the first time,\" Haley responded.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor drew criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike after her initial response, which left out any mention of slavery. Haley later alleged without evidence that the questioner at the town hall was potentially a Democratic \"plant.\"\n\nHaley's appearance on the show drew backlash Sunday morning.\n\nAuthor Majid M. Padellan on X, formerly Twitter, questioned what a \"slavery denier (is) doing on SNL anyway?\"\n\n\"Saturday Night Live sure does have a long track record of comedy-washing hateful conservatives,\" activist Charlotte Clymer wrote on X.\n\nConservative viewers also questioned Haley's appearance, with conservative political YouTuber Benny Johnson calling her an \"Anti-Trump liberal.\"\n\nNBC declined to comment on Sunday.\n\nAyo Edebiri addresses past Jennifer Lopez criticism\n\nEdebiri, in her monologue on \"SNL,\" looked back on times she aspired to be a writer on the show and marked Black History Month with a joke about her Boston roots.\n\n\"I was born and raised in Boston, which makes me the first Black woman to ever admit that,\" she said. \"Yeah, three days into February and I\u2019m already making Black history.\"\n\nLater in the episode, \"The Bear\" actress' own past comments came back to haunt her.\n\nAfter a game show sketch titled \"Why'd You Say It,\" where players explain their questionable Instagram comments, Edebiri addressed her past criticism of musical guest Jennifer Lopez.\n\nEdebiri alluded to comments she made on a podcast in 2020 that were critical of the singer.\n\nDuring a 2020 appearance on the \"Scam Goddess\" podcast, the \"Bottoms\" actress said Lopez's career was \"one long scam\" and later added: \"I think she thinks that she\u2019s still good even though she's not singing for most of these songs.\"\n\n\"We get it. It's wrong to leave mean comments or post comments just for clout or run your mouth on a podcast, and you don't consider the impact because you're 24 and stupid,\" Edebiri, now 28, said during her \"SNL\" appearance. \"But I think I speak for everyone when I say from now on, we're going to be a lot more thoughtful about what we post online.\"\n\nContributing: Savannah Kuchar"}

The images from those days are burned in my memory,\" he added.\n\nBelichick even took an opportunity to poke a little fun at himself: \"You may even have enjoyed my fashion sense and press conferences, or maybe you just tolerated them. I loved coaching here and, together, we experienced some amazing moments.\"\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nBelichick, 71, officially parted ways with the Patriots on Jan. 11 after a 4-13 campaign \u2013 his worst in 24 seasons with the organization.\n\nHis future in coaching remains unclear. He interviewed for the Atlanta Falcons job that ultimately went to Raheem Morris.\n\nSince then, speculation has centered around some NFL teams whose coaches will be on the hot seat next season. There's also a possibility he could join his former Super Bowl-winning quarterback and make the move to television.\n\nIt's not like he doesn't have the resume: In addition to those six Super Bowl trophies, Belichick also owns a Sports Emmy for his work with NFL Films and NFL Network on 2019\u2019s \"NFL 100 All-Time Team\" series."}

The atmospheric river \u2212 like a river in the sky \u2212 is the second to pound the state in recent days, but forecasters said this storm would be the season's most potent, particularly in Southern California.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a rare hurricane-force wind warning for the Central Coast: Wind gusts up to 92 mph were possible from the Monterey Peninsula to the northern section of San Luis Obispo County. San Francisco officials sent out alerts about flooded streets, a large fallen tree that brought wires down and a hillside landslide.\n\n\"All systems are go for one of the most dramatic weather days in recent memory,\" the National Weather Service said Sunday.\n\nTorrential rain could lead to flooding and mudslides\n\nHeavy rain was expected from the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast through Southern California on Sunday into Monday, the NOAA Weather Prediction Center said. Rainfall of 2-5 inches and up to 6-10 inches in some spots was likely, the prediction center said. \"This will result in considerable flash, urban and small stream flooding with debris flows and mudslides,\" the prediction center said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Sunday that heavy rain would be moving into the area: 3-6 inches was expected for the coasts and valleys and up to 6-12 inches in the mountains.\n\n\"Due to the numerous mountains and hills, even just a few inches of rain can cause significant flooding,\" AccuWeather Senior Director of Forecasting Operations Dan DePodwin said. \"The greatest risk ... is expected across the canyons and hills of Southern California, especially in Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties.\u201d\n\nEvacuation warnings and orders were in effect for Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Ventura and Monterey counties. Classes were canceled Monday for schools across Santa Barbara County.\n\n\u201cThis storm is predicted to be one of the largest and most significant in our county\u2019s history and our goal is to get through it without any fatalities or any serious injuries,\u201d Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.\n\nThree children 'in the eye of the storm' 400-plus miles away\n\nDoug and Pam Barry were among more than 100,000 Californians without power as an outage hit their Miraloma Park neighborhood in San Francisco on Sunday morning.\n\nThat was far from their biggest concern, though. Their two sons are attending college in Los Angeles and San Diego, respectively, and their daughter Jessica was visiting the youngest son in San Diego when the storm hit. Now she's hoping her plans to return Sunday to her home in Scottsdale, Arizona, don't get disrupted.\n\n\"We have all three children in the eye of the storm in Southern California,'' Doug Barry said. \"We texted them yesterday to be careful with the approaching storm. We will get a good storm, but they will have it worse. Rarely do we share the same weather concerns with our children in California who are 400-plus miles away.''\n\nHeavy snow, powerful winds could lead to whiteout conditions\n\nHeavy, wet snow was expected to spread across the Sierra Nevada on Sunday through Tuesday morning, with snowfall of 2-3 inches per hour, the prediction center said. Wind gusts of up to 60 mph could lead to whiteout conditions in the Southern California mountains, forecasters said.\n\nThunderstorms, waterspouts and tornadoes are possible\n\nBrutal onshore winds will also pummel the northern, central and southern coasts through Monday, forecasters said, leading to damaging surf. Thunderstorms, waterspouts and even tornadoes with hail are possible, weather.com said.\n\nWhy is this storm so dangerous?\n\nThe first storm in the \"Pineapple Express\" soaked the state with 1-6 inches of rain Wednesday and Thursday. The new storm is laden with even more moisture, forecasters said, setting up dangerous and deadly conditions in already-saturated regions. Some of the rainiest areas could pick up a foot or more of rain in only 48 hours, Accuweather said.\n\nWhat is a Pineapple Express?\n\nA Pineapple Express is the best-known nickname for an atmospheric river, which occurs when the source of the moisture is near Hawaii. When a Pineapple Express hits land in the western U.S. and Canada, it triggers heavy rain and snow. In California, it can lead to several inches of rain in a day.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY; The Associated Press"}

Seeking to upset the former president in the South Carolina Republican primary on Feb. 24, Haley also said Trump should not be trying to block a congressional border bill. Instead, the former South Carolina governor told CNN a new border security plan should be passed as soon as possible.\n\nHaley also used the interview to clarify recent comments she made about states and seceding, telling CNN that no state has the right to leave the country.\n\nNikki Haley issues warning to Republican voters\n\nHaley on Sunday warned that, as Republican voters select their 2024 nominee to potentially face off against President Joe Biden, \"For the next year, (Trump is) going to be sitting a courtroom.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"I think it speaks for itself that he's saying he's going to be spending more time in a courtroom than he's going to be spending on the campaign trail. We've got a country in disarray and a world on fire.\"\n\nHaley spoke on CNN days after a federal judge announced the indefinite delay of a March 4 scheduled trial in which Trump is accused of trying to steal the 2020 election from Biden. The trial is being delayed because Trump's pre-trial appeals are taking up so much time.\n\nTrump also faces three other criminal trials: A hush money case in New York state, a classified documents case in Florida and another election fraud case in the state of Georgia.\n\nTrials in those cases are proposed for March, May and August, but pre-trial maneuvering could delay any or all of them.\n\nMeanwhile, sandwiched between those potential trial dates, the Republican nominating convention starts July 15 in Milwaukee.\n\nTrump, Haley and border politics\n\nTrump in recent weeks has pushed House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. and other Republican leaders to kill a long-awaited bipartisan border security bill by arguing that Biden already has the power to stop illegal crossings.\n\nBut the former president's critics have argued that Trump simply wants to stop lawmakers from working with Biden on major border legislation ahead of the election.\n\nHaley, for example, told CNN on Sunday that said Trump \"is absolutely playing politics\" with the border.\n\n\"He shouldn't be getting involved telling Republicans that wait until the election because we don't want this to help Biden win.

The former United Nations ambassador sought to clean up recent comments she made suggesting that states - specifically Texas - could secede from the Union, an issue that helped trigger the Civil War.\n\nIn a recent radio interview, Haley said that \"if Texas decides they want to do that, they can do that.\" She said \"if that whole state says, 'We don't want to be part of America anymore,' I mean, that's their decision to make.\"\n\nShe also added: \"Let's talk about what's reality. Texas isn't going to secede.\"\n\nBut Haley this week told CNN said she was referencing comments made during her 2010 campaign for South Carolina governor, and that she did not mean to express support for secession and the country breaking apart.\n\n\"The Constitution doesn't allow for that,\" Haley said.\n\nShe said lawmakers should understand the frustration that some state officials feel over the authority of the federal government, citing Texas and its treatment of the U.S.-Mexico border as a prime example."}

But later, The Isley Brothers lead the crowd through their 1959 call-and-response classic \u201cShout\u201d and Paul Shaffer instinctively directs the band while standing by his seat a dozen tables from the stage.\n\nIt\u2019s that kind of musical teeter-tottering, coupled with a guest list stocked with major names in music (Cher, Stevie Wonder, Earth, Wind & Fire), film (Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep) and politics (Nancy Pelosi, attending the event for the 24th consecutive time) that makes Davis\u2019 soiree, a staple of Grammys eve since 1976, both belle and ball.\n\nDavis, an impressively sharp 91, curates his signature event with an ear toward showcasing burgeoning artists while also solidifying the legacy of the veterans, most of whom, like Saturday\u2019s show-closers Gladys Knight and Dionne Warwick, he\u2019s worked with for decades.\n\nFor Davis, it\u2019s about the performance, and his criteria for newer artists is simple.\n\n\u201cWill they get a standing ovation after they perform? It really is clear who is a great performer and who is a recording performer. You don\u2019t look at the charts and book it off the highest number on Billboard,\u201d Davis tells USA TODAY the afternoon before the 2024 celebration in his airy suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the scrutiny that the party is under from the press and the artists and I am alert that I have to have the best of both the new and the established. The bar is up there.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday night inside a Beverly Hilton ballroom, Hanks introduces Davis with a rousing oration that thematically probes the breadth of the record mogul\u2019s nearly 60 years in the industry.\n\n\u201cWho is responsible for this party, both the cause and the catering?\u201d Hanks asks in a winking tone. \u201cClive is the chef in the kitchen of the food of love: music.\u201d\n\nAs Davis said Friday, \u201cI love the party not because it\u2019s a party. I love it showing the love purely of music, in a non-competitive way, and helping be an architect for the new and keeping alive the all-time greats.\u201d\n\nAnother of those veterans, Public Enemy, stormed the stage with humor (Flavor Flav managed to flirt with Megan Thee Stallion and Serena Williams) and potent messaging (\u201cCan\u2019t Truss It,\u201d \u201cFight the Power\u201d) as they paid tribute to this year\u2019s Salute to Industry Icons Award recipient, Jon Platt, chairman and CEO of Sony Music Publishing.\n\nSome other highlights from the star-studded party:\n\nGreen Day opened the show with a punchy set\n\nThe California trio opened Davis\u2019 party and landed an introduction from super-fan Williams, who joked she wanted to join their summer stadium tour as a mascot. But Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tr\u00e9 Cool need little more than their amps turned up to 11 to invigorate a crowd. A tight, punchy \u201cAmerican Idiot\u201d (MAGA line intact) paired with the 30-year-old \u201cDookie\u201d favorite \u201cBasket Case\u201d for a rollicking appetizer of the night. Even though they were playing a ballroom stage, Green Day attacked their assignment with the vigor of a stadium setting.\n\nJosh Groban\n\nA longtime staple of Davis\u2019 parties, the mild-mannered singer-actor with the booming baritone proffered one of the most visceral performances of the night. Also a Broadway vet, Groban shared a pair of Stephen Sondheim classics, the cautionary tale \u201cChildren Will Listen\u201d (from \u201cInto the Woods\u201d) and the heart-piercing commentary on protection and love, \u201cNot While I\u2019m Around\u201d (from \u201cSweeney Todd\u201d). After telling the crowd, \u201cOne of the great honors of my career is whenever I get to sit in this room,\u201d Groban slid behind a piano to perform one of Davis\u2019 favorite songs, Simon & Garfunkel\u2019s \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water.\u201d Michael Trotter Jr. of The War and Treaty joined Groban for a gorgeous interplay of voices while Trotter\u2019s proud wife and singing partner Tanya stood filming the performance on her phone.\n\nJelly Roll\n\nThe man born Jason DeFord clearly got the memo that Davis appreciates a memorable performance. With a gospel chorus behind him and several more singers lining the aisles, Jelly Roll proclaimed, \u201cI believe in making therapeutic music!\u201d as he rolled into the country-rocker \u201cNeed a Favor.\u201d Lainey Wilson returned to the stage for the pair\u2019s Grammy-nominated \u201cSave Me,\u201d which Jelly Roll said \u201csaved my life.\u201d The searing ballad about being broken and damaged resonated as the deepest performance of the night."}

The airstrikes Friday were in response to months of attacks on U.S. bases, including a drone strike on a U.S. base in Jordan near the Syrian border that killed three Americans.\n\nThe Houthis were targeted in response to scores of strikes on commercial ships in the Red Sea area since November. It was the third time that British and American forces have jointly targeted the Houthis, who say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in war-battered Gaza, which has been bombarded since the Oct. 7 Hamas assault on Israeli border communities.\n\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said the latest U.S.-British response was \"intended to degrade Houthi capabilities used to continue their reckless and unlawful attacks.\"\n\nUS strikes on Iran-backed groupscontinue into second day: New sites in Yemen targeted\n\nDevelopments:\n\n\u220e The Palestinian death toll has risen to 27,365, and the majority of the victims are women and children, the Ministry of Health in Gaza announced Sunday. More than 66,000 people were wounded and about 8,000 remain unaccounted for, the ministry said.\n\n\u220e Iran warned the U.S. not to target two cargo ships suspected of serving as an operating base for Iranian commandos. The Behshad and Saviz are registered as commercial ships with a Tehran-based company the U.S. Treasury has sanctioned for aiding Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard\n\n\u220e Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that at least two children were killed in an Israeli attack on kindergarten in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using schools and other public spaces as cover and civilians as human shields.\n\nIsrael raids outpost where Hamas trained for Oct. 7 attack\n\nAn Israeli raid in southern Gaza uncovered headquarters for the Khan Yunes Brigade that included the office of Mohammed Sinwar, the brother of Hamas political leader Yahya Sinwar, the Israeli military said in a statement. The Alqadsia outpost was used to train militants who carried out the stunning Oct. 7 attack on border Israeli communities, the statement said. The attackers killed more than 1,200 people and took about 240 hostages, more than 100 of whom remain captives in Gaza.\n\nThe outpost included models simulating the entrance gates of kibbutzim and other areas that were raided. Militants defending the outpost were \"eliminated\" by sniper fire, tank shell fire and air force strikes, the statement said.\n\nHamas considers framework for hostage deal, but sides appear far apart\n\nHamas leaders need more time to study the proposed framework for a cease-fire, but there is \"no deal yet,\" a senior Hamas official said. Osama Hamdan said Hamas is reviewing the framework hammered out by Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. But Hamdan said his militant organization has not backed down from demands that include the Israeli military's withdrawal from Gaza, lifting of the blockade imposed on the enclave, rebuilding the war-battered cities and towns, providing humanitarian aid, a prisoner-for-hostage deal and a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nSeveral of those demands have been repeatedly rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamdan, at a briefing in Lebanon, credited Egypt and Qatar for attempting to broker a deal but blamed Israel's \"obstinacy\" for the apparent failure to reach an agreement.\n\n\"We value the efforts made by the brothers in Egypt and Qatar in order to reach a sustainable cease-fire agreement in Gaza,\" Hamdan said.\n\nIsraeli national security chief says Biden hampering Israeli war effort\n\nThe Biden administration is hindering Israel\u2019s war effort and Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump would provide Tel Aviv the freedom to crush Hamas, Israel's national security minister says. Itamar Ben-Gvir, who leads a far-right political party crucial to Netanyahu's ruling coalition, has repeatedly chastised Netanyahu in recent weeks for being too willing to cut a deal with Hamas to free more than 100 hostages. Ben-Gvir also has sharp worlds for President Joe Biden, despite his firm support for Israel in the face of global discontent at the withering destruction and death fueled by Israel's invasion.\n\n\u201cInstead of giving us his full backing, Biden is busy with giving humanitarian aid and fuel (to Gaza), which goes to Hamas,\u201d Ben-Gvir told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cIf Trump was in power, the U.S. conduct would be completely different.\u201d\n\nIran condemns U.S.-British airstrikes\n\nIran also condemned the U.S.-British airstrikes \u2212 which took place with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand \u2212 as as breach of Yemen\u2019s territorial integrity and of international law. Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani urged the global community to hold the nations involved accountable.\n\n\u201cThe United States and Britain\u2019s military adventurism marked by their military strikes on the regional countries is a follow-up to these two countries\u2019 wrong approach and policy of resorting to militarism to advance their illegitimate objectives in the region,\" Kanaani said, adding that the strikes were \"in stark contrast to Washington and London repeatedly claiming that they wouldn\u2019t like to see war and conflict spread in the region.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press"}

And there are a variety of ways to play that gets everyone involved.\n\nNew to the game? USA TODAY Sports has you covered with everything you need to know to play Super Bowl squares, including which squares are most likely to win.\n\nWHO'S IN SUPER BOWL 58?:Dissecting Chiefs-49ers matchup and their road to Las Vegas\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nMORE TO BET:Vegas odds for spread, moneyline, over/under for Chiefs-49ers\n\nHow do Super Bowl squares work?\n\nThe game starts with a 10-by-10 grid \u2013 100 individual boxes \u2013 each of which is assigned a universal price tag, like $1 per square. There is no limit on the number of boxes that can be purchased.\n\nThe numbers 0-9 are assigned to the columns and rows (usually at random), giving two numbers to each individual cell. Once the 100 boxes are accounted for, the game will be ready to begin.\n\nFrom here, the game can be played in a few different ways. The Super Bowl teams are listed on a respective axis. Typically, one axis represents the last digit of the AFC team's score and the other represents the last digit of the NFC team's score.\n\nWhoever has the correct digits of the final score wins the pot; For example, if the Chiefs defeat the 49ers 30-27, the winning square would be where the No. 0 on the AFC axis meets the No. 7 on the NFC axis.\n\nWhat other Super Bowl square options are there?\n\nOne of the most popular variations on Super Bowl squares is to pay out 25% of the pot at the end of every quarter, rather than all of it at the end of the game. (Or, in some cases, 20% at the end of the first and third quarters, and 30% at the end of each half). This makes it more likely that there will be multiple winners, albeit with smaller shares of the pot.\n\nWhat are the best squares to have?\n\nIt's difficult to pinpoint the best squares when the values are assigned at random. However, the best bet is generally tied to any combination of zeroes and/or sevens. This is due to likely more touchdowns being scored.\n\nIn a 2013 blog post, the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective wrote that the single best square to have is seven on the betting favorite's axis. Players would also want to bet the zero on the underdog's, with the 0-0 square a close second. The Washington Post lists 0-0 as the best square to have, with the two combinations of seven and zero (7-0 or 0-7) right behind it.\n\nField goals and extra points are also quite common in NFL games. Thus, numbers such as three, four and one also aren't bad numbers to have from an odds standpoint.\n\nWhat are the worst squares to have?\n\nAny combination of twos or fives. According to the aforementioned Harvard Sports Analysis Collective post from 2013, the 2-2 square and 2-5 square (two on the favorite's axis, five on the underdog's) are among the worst, because it usually takes some combination of safeties, missed extra points or other general strangeness to get there.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' Casey Moore contributed to this report"}

Highlights, lowlights, stories of redemption, moments of disbelief and so much more. And following a 13-season run of sheer dominance (1984 through 1996) by the NFC, the Super Bowl has generally lived up to its outsized billing over the past quarter-century-plus \u2013 an epoch that has included the NFL's longest-running dynasty, its greatest player and some of the best bouts we've ever seen with the Lombardi Trophy hanging in the balance.\n\nHere are 58 of my favorite Super Sunday memories as Super Bowl 58 between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers nears:\n\n1. Malcolm Butler's INT\n\nPivotal. Shocking. Unforgettable. The New England Patriots' undrafted rookie cornerback made the rarest of plays, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat by intercepting QB Russell Wilson at the goal line with 20 seconds left to preserve a 28-24 win in Super Bowl 49. In the process, Butler derailed the Seattle Seahawks' dynastic bid and launched a lifetime of second guessing for the legions who skewered Seattle coach Pete Carroll for not directing Wilson to hand off to RB Marshawn \"Beast Mode\" Lynch, who'd already scored this day. Last, yet certainly not least, Butler saved Patriots QB Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick from the narrative that they were \"only\" 3-3 in Super Bowls to that point. Way to just \u201cdo your job,\" Malcolm Butler!\n\n2. Roethlisberger-to-Holmes\n\nWhat was better, QB Ben Roethlisberger's precision strike to the back corner of the end zone \u2013 rifled through three Arizona Cardinals \u2013 or WR Santonio Holmes' ability to snatch it while keeping his toes down as he fell out of bounds with 35 seconds on the clock? Beautifully executed all the way around, and it gave the Pittsburgh Steelers a record sixth Lombardi Trophy as they rallied for a 27-23 victory in Super Bowl 43.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\n3. David Tyree's helmet catch\n\nMost coaches would cringe if their quarterback threw into triple coverage in the middle of the field while scrambling amid a broken play. But that's what New York Giants star Eli Manning did, and Tyree famously managed to pin the pass against his helmet on the other end of the 32-yard hookup with 59 seconds to go. Four plays later, Manning hit WR Plaxico Burress for the game-winning TD as the Giants shocked the previously undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl 42.\n\n4. Montana-to-Taylor\n\nThe 49ers' game-winning march began with QB Joe Montana surveying the stands and asking teammates in the huddle, \"Isn't that John Candy?\" Joe Cool indeed. Eleven plays and 92 yards later, WR John Taylor caught the decisive 10-yard pass from Montana with 34 seconds to go as the Niners overcame the Cincinnati Bengals 20-16 in Super Bowl 23.\n\n5. Wide right\n\nThat's where Buffalo Bills kicker Scott Norwood's 47-yard field-goal try (barely) missed with 4 seconds left in Super Bowl 25. The Giants hung on for a 20-19 win, and Buffalo would never get any closer to a title despite reaching Super Sunday three more times.\n\n6. Mike Jones' tackle\n\nWith the Tennessee Titans 10 yards away from a potential game-tying touchdown with 5 seconds to play in Super Bowl 34, Jones, an unheralded St. Louis Rams linebacker, limited WR Kevin Dyson to a 9-yard gain \u2013 just shy of the goal line \u2013 on the game-ending play.\n\n7. Adam Vinatieri's Super Bowl 36 field goal\n\nOn the final snap, the Patriots kicker split the uprights from 48 yards \u2013 he was celebrating before the ball went through \u2013 literally kick-starting the New England dynasty and completing one of the Super Bowl's biggest upsets as the Pats knocked off the heavily favored \"Greatest Show on Turf\" Rams 20-17. Vinatieri would drill an only slightly less dramatic FG in the final seconds two years later to beat the Carolina Panthers.\n\n8. '70 chip'\n\nThat was the play call by Washington, which trailed the Miami Dolphins 17-13, on fourth-and-1 in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl 17. The ball went to RB John Riggins, who, running behind his dominant \"Hogs\" offensive line, ran through the tackle of DB Don McNeal before busting down the left sideline for a 43-yard touchdown the Fins wouldn't overcome.\n\n9. Tracy Porter's pick-six\n\nWith QB Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts 31 yards from a game-tying touchdown with less than four minutes to go in Super Bowl 44, the New Orleans Saints corner swiped a pass intended for WR Reggie Wayne and set sail for a game-icing 74-yard TD.\n\n10. James White in OT\n\nThe anonymous third-down back of the Patriots ran 2 yards to glory in the first (and still only) Super Sunday overtime, capping New England's epic comeback against the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl 51 while boosting his Super Bowl single-game record point total to 20.\n\n11. Doug Williams' comeback\n\nThe Washington quarterback crumbled to the turf while being sacked in the first quarter, his surgically repaired left knee hyperextended with his team trailing the Denver Broncos 10-0. But Williams would miss just two plays before launching four TD passes in the next period on his way to becoming MVP and the first Black quarterback to win a Super Bowl as Washington cruised to a 42-10 rout in Super Bowl 22.\n\n12. We're No. 1\n\nJoe Namath's raised index finger as he jogged off the Orange Bowl field after the New York Jets' monumental upset of the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl 3 said it all, especially after the MVP's famous pregame guarantee that the 18-point underdogs would prevail.\n\n13. James Harrison's INT return\n\nThe Steelers pass-rushing linebacker dropped into coverage on a hunch and picked off Cardinals QB Kurt Warner at the goal line before a 100-yard tightrope sprint up the sideline for a TD completed what was at least a 10-point swing before halftime in Super Bowl 43, which Pittsburgh won by four points.\n\n14. Terry Bradshaw KO'd\n\nAs he launched what would prove to be the decisive 64-yard TD pass to WR Lynn Swann in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl 10, the chin of the Steelers quarterback was introduced to the helmet of Dallas Cowboys DL Larry Cole. Bradshaw was out before he hit the ground and wouldn't play again in the game, but his throw earned Pittsburgh its second ring.\n\n15. Isaac Bruce's TD\n\nIt gets overshadowed by Jones' tackle, but the Rams don't win without Warner's 73-yard TD pass to Bruce with 1:54 to go on St. Louis' first play after the Titans had erased a 16-0 deficit.\n\n16. Burrow bagged\n\nTrailing 23-20 inside the final minute of Super Bowl 56, Bengals QB Joe Burrow was trying to pull one more rabbit out of the hat from midfield. Instead, Los Angeles Rams DL Aaron Donald burst through the line on what turned out to be Cincy's final play, ragdolling Joey B. into a desperation incompletion that put the game on ice \u2013 Donald pointing to his ring finger, indicating where his new ice would be featured.\n\n17. Favre-to-Rison\n\nVintage Brett Favre. On the Green Bay Packers' second play of Super Bowl 31, the MVP quarterback called an audible before launching a 54-yard touchdown to WR Andre Rison streaking down the middle of the field. Favre sprinted after his receiver, helmet held aloft, and Green Bay was on its way to its first title in 29 years.\n\n18. John Elway's helicopter\n\nThe 37-year-old Broncos quarterback, in desperate pursuit of his first title after being blown out in his first three Super Sunday starts, famously went airborne and was spun around by Packers defenders on an 8-yard third-quarter run that gave Denver a first-and-goal. It set up MVP Terrell Davis' go-ahead TD run in Super Bowl 32, which the Broncos eventually won 31-24.\n\n19. Mario Manningham's catch\n\nFour years after being victimized by Tyree, the Patriots fell prey to an amazing 38-yard completion from Eli Manning to Manningham with 3:39 to go on the Giants' game-winning drive of Super Bowl 46. Manningham barely got his feet down at midfield, a play the Patriots unsuccessfully challenged.\n\n20. Jackie Smith's drop\n\nThe Hall of Fame tight end, wide open in the end zone, dropped a perfect pass from Cowboys QB Roger Staubach in Super Bowl 13 that would have knotted the game 21-21, prompting broadcaster Verne Lundquist to exclaim, \"Bless his heart, he's got to be the sickest man in America.\" Yep. The Cowboys would eventually lose to the Steelers 35-31.\n\n21. 2-3 Jet Chip Wasp\n\nTrailing by 10 with more than half the fourth quarter expired and facing a third-and-15 from his own 35-yard line in Super Bowl 54, Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes knew his team was backed into a corner. But he suggested this play, which required WR Tyreek Hill to run a late-developing route deep into San Francisco's zone coverage. Mahomes took the snap and had to drop 14 yards into the pocket in order to evade the 49ers' relentless pass rush, then heaved the ball toward Hill, who'd cut toward the sideline to find a soft spot in the zone. The result was a 44-yard completion that set up a Mahomes TD pass three plays later and opened the floodgates for K.C.'s belated 21-point outburst and first championship in 50 years.\n\n22. Julian Edelman's shoestring snatch\n\nThe Patriots' slot man extraordinaire snared a ball that was deflected (and nearly intercepted) by Falcons CB Robert Alford microns above the turf, extending New England's game-tying drive after the team had fallen behind 28-3 in the second half of Super Bowl 51. It was also a welcome turn of events to Pats fans, who'd suffered through script-flipping catches by Tyree and Manningham.\n\n23. Jim O'Brien's kick\n\nThe Baltimore Colts rookie saw his first extra-point try blocked and missed his initial field-goal attempt in a mistake-laden Super Bowl 5. But his 32-yard FG with 5 seconds left gave the Colts a 16-13 defeat of the Cowboys in the Super Bowl's first truly dramatic moment.\n\n24. 'Philly Special'\n\nIt's already earned its spot in Super Bowl lore as the enduring moment of the Philadelphia Eagles' long-awaited Super Bowl 52 victory. However, QB Nick Foles' 1-yard TD grab from TE Trey Burton off a reverse, on fourth-and-goal just before halftime, was really more gutsy than conclusive given the Patriots eventually overcame (temporarily) the 22-12 hole they fell into on the play.\n\n25. The lights go out in New Orleans\n\nWith the 49ers trailing the Baltimore Ravens 28-6 in the third quarter of Super Bowl 47, half of the Superdome's lights lost power, causing a 34-minute delay. The Niners surged back, eventually cutting the lead to two, before ultimately succumbing.\n\n26. 49ers' goal-line stand\n\nUp 20-7 in the third quarter of Super Bowl 16, San Francisco turned the Bengals away three times from the 1-yard line, including LB Dan Bunz's open-field tackle of Charles Alexander on a third-down swing pass. The 49ers would hang on 26-21 for their first title.\n\n27. Ty Law's pick-six\n\nDecided underdogs against the Rams in 2002, the Patriots were hanging around in the second quarter, trailing 3-0. But Law pilfered a Warner pass down the right sideline intended for Bruce and, arm held high, raced 47 yards for a touchdown and 7-3 lead New England wouldn't relinquish.\n\n28. John Kasay's errant kickoff\n\nThe Panthers had just tied Super Bowl 38 29-29 with 73 seconds to go. Then Kasay booted the ensuing kickoff out of bounds, putting Brady and the Patriots at their own 40-yard line. Six plays and 37 yards was all they needed to set up Vinatieri for the kill shot.\n\n29. Seahawks safety\n\nOn the first play from scrimmage in Super Bowl 48, Broncos C Manny Ramirez's snap sailed over the head of Peyton Manning and into the end zone, giving Seattle a 2-0 lead. No one knew it then, but the game was essentially over as the Seahawks would score the first 36 points in a 43-8 laugher.\n\n30. Garo's gaffe\n\nThe Dolphins' Cyprus-born kicker made the team's bid for a 17-0 season too close for comfort in Super Bowl 7. Trying to give Miami a 17-0 lead with less than three minutes to go, Yepremian's 42-yard field-goal attempt was blocked. He unwisely tried to pass the ball after collecting the rebound, and it ended up in the hands of Mike Bass, who took it 49 yards for Washington's only score.\n\n31. Graham cracker\n\nThe play didn't garner the cachet of the \"Philly Special,\" but Eagles DE Brandon Graham's strip sack of Brady with 2:09 remaining in Super Bowl 52 was the key (only?) defensive play on a day when the teams combined for an NFL record 1,151 yards of offense. Brady's fumble occurred with New England trailing 38-33 and led to Philly's game-icing field goal.\n\n32. Ahmad Bradshaw's TD mistake\n\nThe Giants tailback scored what proved to be a game-winning 6-yard TD with 57 seconds left in Super Bowl 46, which New York would win 21-17. However the Patriots let Bradshaw into the end zone in order to get the ball back to Brady \u2013 New York could have milked the clock before a chip-shot field goal \u2013 which he realized too late as he awkwardly fell into the paint. (The Packers used a similar tactic 14 years before, also unsuccessfully.) Ultimately, no harm, no foul for Bradshaw.\n\n33. John Stallworth's big catch\n\nHe's often overshadowed by teammate Swann, but Stallworth's 73-yard TD grab from Bradshaw in the fourth quarter finally put the Steelers ahead for good in what had been a nip-and-tuck Super Bowl 14 against the LA Rams.\n\n34. Marcus Allen's 74-yard TD\n\nIt was really icing on the cake as the Los Angeles Raiders took a 35-9 third-quarter lead over Washington in Super Bowl 18. But the MVP's ability to find daylight after reversing his field on what looked like a doomed play had President Ronald Reagan quipping after the game: \"I have already got a call from Moscow. They think Marcus Allen is a new secret weapon and they insist that we dismantle him.\"\n\n35. Ambush\n\nThe play call of the Saints' surprise onside kick by Thomas Morstead to start the second half of Super Bowl 44. New Orleans recovered and soon scored a go-ahead TD.\n\n36. U2's halftime show\n\nIt's not universally regarded as the greatest intermission performance on Super Sunday \u2026 but it should be. Bono, Edge, Larry Mullen and Adam Clayton concluded their three-song set with \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" as the names of those killed on Sept. 11 just a few months prior scrolled on a scrim suspended from the Superdome's roof. The 2001 terrorist attacks forced the NFL season to be temporarily suspended and ultimately moved Super Bowl 36 back a week, marking the first time the game was played in February.\n\n37. Vince Lombardi carried off\n\nThe iconic Packers coach, reviled by many of his players a decade earlier but eventually beloved, rode off the field on the shoulders of his charges, including G Jerry Kramer, as Green Bay won its fifth and final title of the 1960s by winning Super Bowl 2. It was Lombardi's final game as the team's coach.\n\n38. Buddy Ryan carried off\n\nThe defensive coordinator of the famed 1985 Chicago Bears defense got the same treatment as head coach Mike Ditka after a 46-10 blowout of the Patriots in Super Bowl 20. It was emblematic of divided loyalties on a team that wouldn't win another title after Ryan left to coach the Eagles.\n\n39. Jerome Bettis leaves tunnel alone\n\nThe Hall of Fame running back was playing his final game in his hometown, Detroit, for Super Bowl 40. Bettis charged out of the tunnel for pregame introductions and, unbeknownst to him, LB Joey Porter held the rest of the Steelers back to give his teammate a special moment. Eventually realizing he was isolated on the field, a beaming Bettis beckoned his teammates to join him in a game they would win 21-10.\n\n40. Super Bowl's first TD\n\nIt was scored by Packers WR Max McGee, who was only playing because of an injury to teammate Boyd Dowler. McGee was less than 100% after a long night of partying, but you'd never know as he reached behind his back for an underthrown pass from QB Bart Starr on a 37-yard score that got Green Bay on course for a 35-10 win over the Chiefs.\n\n41. Jacoby Jones' heroics\n\nFew had heard of him before he ended the Ravens' final drive in the first half of Super Bowl 47 with a 56-yard TD catch. Jones then opened the second half with a record 108-yard kickoff return for a TD that gave Baltimore a 28-6 lead that proved too much for the 49ers \u2026 even with help from that power outage.\n\n42. Whoops, Leon Lett\n\nThe mishaps of the Cowboys defensive tackle have overshadowed a sterling career. But we can't forget that his showboating on a 64-yard fumble return in Super Bowl 27 enabled Bills WR Don Beebe to swat the ball out of Lett's paw for a touchback just short of another Dallas touchdown. It prevented the triumphant Cowboys from scoring a game record 59 points.\n\n43. 65 Toss Power Trap\n\nChiefs coach Hank Stram, famously mic'd up as NFL Films tried a new technique, gleefully called the play that would result in a 5-yard Mike Garrett touchdown and a 16-0 lead in Super Bowl 4, which Kansas City would go on to win 23-7.\n\n44. Peace\n\nSuper Bowl 55 was eminently disappointing, the highly anticipated Brady-Mahomes matchup fizzling as the Buccaneers continuously harassed the Kansas City star in a 31-9 Tampa Bay blowout. But it was hilarious watching Bucs rookie S Antoine Winfield Jr. flash the peace sign to Hill after breaking up a fourth-and-10 pass intended for the speedy receiver late in the fourth quarter. It was payback to Hill, who gave the deuces to Winfield and Co. earlier in the season while scoring three TDs in a Chiefs win at Tampa. \u201cThe taunting, man, it\u2019s something I just had to do,\u201d Winfield said. \u201cWhen we played them earlier, Hill went off on us. He back-flipped in front of my face and gave me the peace sign. So it was only right that I gave him the peace sign right back to him. It felt amazing to do that. I\u2019m not even gonna lie.\u201d\n\n45. Jack Lambert sticks up for teammate\n\nSteelers K Roy Gerela had a rough Super Bowl 10, missing two field goals and an extra point. But when Cowboys S Cliff Harris patted Gerela on the helmet after his 33-yard misfire in the third quarter, Lambert \u2013 Pittsburgh's menacing middle linebacker \u2013 flung Harris to the turf and stood over him. Dallas players later admitted Harris' taunt infuriated the Steelers, who trailed 10-7 at the time but outscored Dallas 14-7 in the fourth quarter to prevail.\n\n46. Wardrobe Malfunction\n\nAdmit it, Janet Jackson's halftime \"slip\" provided your most vivid memory of Super Bowl 38.\n\n47. 'Somebody take the monkey off my back!'\n\nAfter throwing a Super Bowl record six TD passes (and finally escaping Montana's considerable shadow), MVP Steve Young couldn't contain his relief with this statement near the end of the 49ers' 49-26 blowout of the San Diego Chargers in Super Bowl 29.\n\n48. Jermaine Kearse's catch\n\nHis miraculous, tumbling 33-yard grab at the Patriots' 10-yard line with 76 seconds to go seemed destined for a spot alongside Tyree and Manningham as surreal completions that would help vanquish New England. Sadly for Kearse and the Seahawks, Wilson's next pass wasn't nearly as effective.\n\n49. John Mackey's TD\n\nThe tight end got the Baltimore Colts back into Super Bowl 5 with a game-tying 75-yard TD from fellow Hall of Famer Johnny Unitas in the second quarter. The catch was memorable because it deflected off the fingertips of Colts WR Ed Hinton and Dallas CB Mel Renfro before settling into Mackey's hands. The play would have been illegal at the time if Renfro had not touched it \u2013 and the Cowboys vehemently argued he didn't in a game they would lose by three points.\n\n50. Lynn Swann's juggling catch\n\nThe 53-yard reception over Dallas' Mark Washington was the prettiest of Swann's four receptions in Super Bowl 10, when he earned MVP honors. However, as aesthetically pleasing as it was, the catch didn't lead to any Pittsburgh points.\n\n51. Gatorade shower\n\nStill a novel celebration in 1987, it was first seen on Super Sunday when Giants LB Harry Carson, disguised in a security guard's jacket, dumped the drink on coach Bill Parcells at the end of New York's 39-20 Super Bowl 21 win.\n\n52. Fridge scores\n\nThe '85 Bears' coronation in Super Bowl 20 was never in doubt, and DT William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry's 1-yard TD run for a 44-3 lead in the third quarter may have been the crowning moment. Sadly, Ditka belatedly realized it came at the cost of providing legendary RB Walter Payton the Super Bowl score he had long dreamed of but wouldn't realize.\n\n53. Desmond Howard's TD\n\nHis 99-yard kickoff return provided the final score in Green Bay's 35-21 win in Super Bowl 31 and made him the only special teamer to win MVP honors.\n\n54. Run, Willie, run\n\nOn the second play after halftime in Super Bowl 40, Steelers RB \"Fast Willie\" Parker broke a 75-yard TD run, the longest in Super Bowl history, that would give Pittsburgh an insurmountable 14-3 lead over Seattle.\n\n55. Devin Hester's kickoff\n\nFew thought the Indianapolis Colts would kick to the Bears special teams ace, who had six TD returns in the 2006 regular season. But Hester took Vinatieri's game-opening kickoff 92 yards to the house with the kicker flailing to stop him at the end of it. Unfortunately for Hester, he didn't get another opportunity in a game Chicago lost 29-17.\n\n56. Larry Fitzgerald's almost day\n\nIt seemed the Cardinals star had capped an unforgettable postseason \u2013 he had 30 catches for 546 yards and seven TDs in four games \u2013 in style when his 64-yard catch-and-run TD with 2:37 to go in Super Bowl 43 gave Arizona its first lead. Unfortunately for Fitzgerald, he left Roethlisberger and Holmes too much time.\n\n57. OBJ's emotional day\n\nMaking his Super Sunday debut in Super Bowl 56, Rams WR Odell Beckham Jr. opened the scoring against Cincinnati with a 17-yard TD catch from Matthew Stafford in the first quarter. But Beckham wound up celebrating LA's victory in street clothes after suffering a torn ACL before halftime.\n\n58. T.O.'s big day\n\nSeven weeks after breaking his leg, Eagles WR Terrell Owens caught nine passes for 122 yards in Super Bowl 39. His courageous effort wasn't quite enough in a three-point loss to the Patriots, but Jack Youngblood was still proud.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on X, formerly Twitter @ByNateDavis."}

Would it be even more fun if the day after the big game was a day off?\n\nThis isn't a new concept. The idea of the Monday after the Super Bowl becoming a national holiday has been around for a while, but it hasn't gathered enough momentum to advance. This year, ice cream treat maker Drumstick is promoting a petition to make post-Super Bowl Monday a national holiday.\n\nSince 2017, Change.org has hosted more than two dozen petitions asking Congress, the president or the NFL to make the Monday after the Super Bowl a national holiday. One suggests moving Presidents Day to the day after the Super Bowl and others suggest no school the day after the game. Some schools have canceled classes the day after the Super Bowl when a local NFL team was involved.\n\n49ers vs. Chiefs preview:Predictions, odds, how to watch Super Bowl 2024\n\nSuper Bowl Monday already an unofficial holiday\n\nSince none of these petitions have paid off, many just unilaterally make the Monday after the Super Bowl a holiday. An estimated 16.1 million employees across the U.S. plan to miss work Monday, Feb. 12, the day after Super Bowl 58 is played, according to a survey of 1,192 Americans, conducted Jan. 10-12, 2024 by The Harris Poll for The Workforce Institute at UKG.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nThe expected absences \u2013 \"Super Bowl flu\" as the workplace management company calls it \u2013 are down from last year when 18.8 million employees said they planned to miss work on Monday after the Super Bowl, according to UKG. And in more good news for managers, an estimated 10 million workers have already requested the day off.\n\nAs many as 14.5 million employed U.S. adults have called in sick to work when they weren't actually sick on the Monday after the Super Bowl, the survey found. An estimated 28% of employees say they will be less productive on that day. In the past, outplacement company Challenger, Gray & Christmas has estimated lost productivity from absent and distracted workers on Super Bowl Monday at $6.5 billion.\n\nMore than one-third (37%) of employees said the day after the Super Bowl should be a national holiday. \"It's a national cultural phenomenon, for sure, and it's a day when people are with family and friends and neighbors and groups (and) in bars, for hours. And on the East Coast, in particular, the game ends really late,\" said Chris Todd, CEO if UKG.\n\nSo the next day, \"everyone treats it like a holiday, even though it's not a holiday,\" he said.\n\nGood managers will treat the Monday after the Super Bowl \"like a holiday, even if it's not a holiday,\" and begin discussing \"the impact that's going to have\" on the workplace ahead of time, Todd said.\n\nSome offices may start work a few hours late or allow some to take the day off. \"We actually think if you manage this well, this is an opportunity for businesses to make themselves better \u2026 (with) an open conversation with employees about the fact that we all have lives outside of work,\" he said.\n\nSuper Bowl Monday: Ice cream maker starts petition to make it a national holiday\n\nThis year, Drumstick has created its own new Change.org petition to, uh, change things. \"Our vision for the future after every Big Game is a Monday where the whole country hits pause on the grind,\" the petition reads. \"But if we don't speak up, the day after Big Game is just another morning alarm, another day lost to the same ol' routine.\"\n\nSo far, nearly 5,000 have signed the petition. By signing, you can also enter a sweepstakes to win your ideal Monday ever. (Examples: Want to learn to surf? Helicopter over the Grand Canyon? Dogsled in Alaska?)\n\nOnce, you've signed the petition, go to Drumstick\u2019s Instagram and find the #DrumstickMonday sweepstakes post, and comment with your ideal #DrumstickMonday.\n\nWhat would it take to make Super Bowl Monday a holiday?\n\nCongress would have to pass a bill in order to make Super Bowl Monday a reality.\n\nThe last time that happened was in June 2021 when Juneteenth (June 19) become a federal holiday commemorating the symbolic end of slavery in the United States. President Joe Biden signed the bill.\n\nIt was the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was created in 1983. Over the years, Congress and the president have enacted 12 federal holidays, including New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Christmas.\n\nFederal holidays, however, are not \"national holidays,\" and only apply to federal employees and the District of Columbia, notes a Congressional Research Service report updated in July 2021. Each state gets to determine its legal holidays, the report states.\n\nFor instance, at least 28 states and the District of Columbia recognized Juneteenth as a public holiday in 2023, according to the Pew Research Center. Some other states may observe the date, but not have a day off.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

ArrowRight Already, high winds have downed trees onto homes, cars and power lines in the Bay Area and Central Coasts, where wind gusts exceeding 70 mph have been reported. Nearly 156,000 customers in the state were without power on Sunday morning and officials are urging residents to only travel for essential reasons.\n\nThe storm could bring months\u2019 worth of rainfall which will trigger rockslides and mudslides, warned officials, who are bracing to see double-digit rainfall totals in the mountains north of Los Angeles.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Oxnard, Calif., is calling the episode \u201cone of the most dramatic weather days in recent memory,\u201d warning of \u201cpotentially life-threatening flash flooding.\u201d The Weather Prediction Center has drawn a level 4 out of 4 \u201chigh\u201d risk of flash flooding and excessive rainfall around Los Angeles County and the transverse mountain ranges two days in a row. Evacuation orders have already been made in Ventura County, where runoff from up to a foot of rain in the mountains will couple with drenching in the lowlands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of the California coast is under other flood watches and high-wind warnings or wind advisories. In addition to a widespread 2 to 6 inches of rain from the Bay Area to San Diego, winds gusting 60 mph or greater at the coast and 40 to 55 mph inland will batter regions from the Sacramento Valley to the Mexican border. Numerous power outages can be expected.\n\nThe number of California customers without power Sunday morning climbed rapidly to nearly 156,000 by midmorning Pacific time, according to poweroutage.us, at least in part because of high winds. This number is expected to rise substantially.\n\nJust offshore, gusts of 70 to 90 mph can\u2019t be ruled out for the Big Sur coastal waters, where it appears the National Weather Service in Los Angeles has issued its first-ever hurricane-force wind warning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo complicate matters further, there is a risk of isolated tornadoes or landfalling waterspouts along the central California coastline. Extreme wind shear, or a change of wind speed/direction with height, will cause rotating downpours to swing ashore. It comes just days after a tornado briefly touched down in Sonoma County during the last atmospheric river event.\n\nThe waterlogged system will encounter frigid air in the higher elevations. A general 3 to 6 feet of snow can be expected above 6,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada, where winds gusting up to 75 mph will combine with possible thundersnow and snowfall rates exceeding 3 inches per hour. Winter storm warnings are in effect and note virtually impossible travel. Snow will also fall in Nevada.\n\nImpacts will wane late Monday in central and Northern California, but the state won\u2019t finally shake the storm system until the latter half of Tuesday.\n\nWhere is the storm now?\n\nOn Sunday morning, a low-pressure system was located several hundred miles offshore of north-central California, moving northeast. It was rapidly \u201cdeepening,\u201d or intensifying, akin to a powerful atmospheric whirlpool spinning counterclockwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat spin was sweeping along a ribbon of robust tropical moisture all the way from Hawaii. The \u201catmospheric river,\u201d or narrow band of extreme moisture, stretched more than 2,500 miles. Now the fire hose is hitting California, and won\u2019t pinch off until Tuesday, at which point it will have swung down the entire coastline.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nTiming\n\nBy dawn on Sunday, the atmospheric river was already soaking central and Northern California while dropping snow in the mountains. Most of the precipitation was north of San Luis Obispo. The northern extent of the precipitation shield was near the Oregon border.\n\nThe rainfall will spread into Santa Barbara and Los Angeles during the evening hours, by which point the main arc of precipitation will still be lashing the central/northern Sierra Nevada and the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys. The Bay Area, meanwhile, might be catching a break as a \u201cdry slot\u201d \u2014 or slice of dry air wrapping into a low-pressure system \u2014 swings overhead.\n\nOn Monday, the main atmospheric river will swing into Southern California, but heavy rain will continue across north-central and Northern California. That\u2019s associated with the \u201ccold core\u201d of low pressure, or the low\u2019s pocket of frigid air aloft, moving over the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few additional thunderstorms may pivot ashore along the central coast of California as well. Isolated small hail can\u2019t be ruled out.\n\nImpacts\n\nFlooding: There is a moderate to high risk of flash flooding from San Francisco southward. In the Bay Area, 2 to 4 inches of rain is likely \u2014 with more in the North Bay and the mountains to the south. For Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, a month or two\u2019s worth of rain \u2014 3 to 6 inches \u2014 may fall. In the transverse ranges and Los Angeles County mountains, 6 to 12 inches of rain is possible. That will trigger major flood problems, particularly as the rain drains into the lower elevations. Rockslides and landslides are likely; recent heavy rains will bolster the risk of shallow landslides, since the top layers of soil are unstable, particularly on steeply sloped surfaces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWinds: At the coast, gusts of 60 to 70 mph are possible between the Bay Area and Santa Barbara. Inland, there could even be some gusts of 50 to 60 mph in the Sacramento Valley. Even San Diego is under a wind advisory, with gusts up to 40 mph possible.\n\nTornadoes: There is a low, but not zero, risk of an isolated spin-up tornado between San Jose and the Lompoc/Santa Maria area.\n\nHeavy snows: Several feet of snow is expected in the northern Sierra Nevada above 6,000 feet, with 2 to 6 feet above elevations of 7,000 feet. The snow is ongoing now, with snowfall rates probably exceeding 3 inches per hour. Thunder and lightning may sporadically accompany snowfall. Wind gusts of 75 mph or greater are possible on the Sierra Ridge. For the southern Sierra, expect 10 inches or more above 6,000 feet, with 1 to 2 feet above 7,500 feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoastal flooding: Coastal flood advisories and/or high surf advisories span much of the California coastline. Large breaking waves of 14 to 18 feet are expected just offshore. A storm surge of a couple of feet is also possible due to persistent onshore flow piling water against the coastline.\n\nHow long will this serious weather last?\n\nThe worst weather will pull south out of Northern California on Monday afternoon. By Tuesday, impacts will be waning in Southern California, and mostly over across central and northern regions."}

Willis (D) admitted in a Friday court filing that she had a personal relationship with the lawyer she appointed to lead the investigation into former president Donald Trump \u2014 and had taken vacations with him \u2014 the judge overseeing the case dashed off an email to the defense attorney who had first accused Willis of misconduct.\n\nIn her filing, Willis asked Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee to cancel an evidentiary hearing on the accusations, saying that the relationship did not create a conflict of interest, did not financially benefit her and should not be used by those she says criminally conspired to try to overturn the 2020 election to evade justice.\n\nMcAfee quickly turned to Ashleigh Merchant, who represents Trump co-defendant Mike Roman, and through his staff emailed her this request, Merchant told The Washington Post: File a response explaining why I should still hold that hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMerchant did so late Friday, claiming to have evidence to dispute some of Willis\u2019s assertions. She accused the prosecutors of trying to \u201cescape accountability\u201d in a case where \u201cfreedom and lives are at stake.\u201d\n\nNow, it falls to McAfee to decide what comes next. Canceling the hearing could allow the case to proceed, but it would also prompt outrage from Trump, who has used all four criminal cases against him as a rallying cry as he marches toward the Republican nomination for president. Moving ahead guarantees more salacious headlines about Willis\u2019s personal life and finances that could undermine the public\u2019s \u2014 and a future jury\u2019s \u2014 faith in her judgment and the merits of the case.\n\nMore important, holding the hearing leaves open the possibility that McAfee does what Merchant asked him to do when she first raised the allegations last month: remove Willis and her entire office from the case, which would almost certainly delay and potentially even scuttle the prosecution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcAfee\u2019s office declined to comment on the case.\n\nRoman, Trump and another defendant in the sprawling election interference case have asked McAfee to disqualify Willis and her office from pursuing this case and drop the charges against them. Roman alleged in a court filing nearly a month ago that Willis financially benefited from appointing a lover, Nathan Wade, as the special prosecutor and then allowing him to pay for \u201clavish\u201d vacations. The district attorney\u2019s office has paid Wade\u2019s law firm more than $650,000 since his appointment in November 2021.\n\nWade, in a sworn affidavit, said that the personal relationship did not start until 2022, once the investigation against Trump was already underway, and that the two split expenses when traveling together. The filing did not say whether the relationship is ongoing.\n\nEven if McAfee decides to cancel the hearing or not take action, the scandal is unlikely to go away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Georgia Senate committee with subpoena power is investigating the allegations, and a member of the Fulton County governing board has suggested he might also launch an investigation. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has referred the matter to the state ethics commission for potential sanctions and has also requested that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp or Attorney General Chris Carr, both Republicans, launch a criminal investigation. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who has been critical of Willis and the Georgia case against Trump, subpoenaed the district attorney Friday while questioning her use of federal funds.\n\nEven the case\u2019s defenders concede that Willis has damaged her credibility.\n\n\u201cEven those of us who understand that Georgia law does not require disqualification are acutely sensitive to the fact that this matter is not being tried merely in the court of law,\u201d said Norm Eisen, who served as special counsel to the House of Representatives\u2019 first impeachment of Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s also being tried in the court of public opinion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMerchant told The Post she was already planning a response to Willis\u2019s filing when McAfee\u2019s request landed Friday afternoon. She quickly filed an initial reply, claiming she will call witnesses who will testify that Wade and Willis were indeed romantically involved before he was appointed to the case. A disputed fact could be reason enough to proceed with the hearing.\n\nRoman gave formal notice through Merchant on Wednesday that he had subpoenaed a dozen witnesses, including Willis and Wade and several of their associates, to testify at the Feb. 15 hearing. Merchant has also subpoenaed documents from Atlanta-area travel agencies and financial records tied to Wade and his law firm. Willis\u2019s Friday motion noted that she plans to file a motion to quash the witness subpoenas \u2014 a move that could require its own evidentiary hearing.\n\nWillis\u2019s office declined to comment on the case, but in her filing, Willis called the accusations \u201cmeritless,\u201d \u201cdistasteful\u201d and \u201cmalicious.\u201d She said that they are irrelevant to the case and that there is no basis in Georgia law for removing her from the prosecution or dismissing the charges. She argued that defendants\u2019 plans to delve into prosecutors\u2019 personal lives amount to a \u201cticket to the circus\u201d designed to \u201cgarner more breathless headlines\u201d rather than settling any matter of law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is also the matter of Willis\u2019s highly publicized speech at a historically Black church in Atlanta shortly after the allegations became public. Framed as a talk with God to commemorate the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday, Willis questioned why Wade was targeted and not the two other private attorneys appointed as special prosecutors in the case, who are White. Willis and Wade are Black. She did not mention Roman or any other defendants by name, and she neither confirmed nor denied any of the specific accusations.\n\nTrump\u2019s defense lawyers, led by Steve Sadow, seized on the speech in their own motion to disqualify Willis and dismiss the case, accusing her of making racially charged accusations against the defendants that could prejudice a future jury. They wrote that Willis\u2019s remarks amount to a violation of Georgia\u2019s rules of professional conduct, which state that the prosecutor in a criminal case shall \u201crefrain from making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused.\u201d They noted that the maximum penalty for such a violation is disbarment.\n\nWillis wrote in her response Friday that her remarks \u201cneither reference this case nor these defendants,\u201d so to cite that as a basis for disqualification \u201cis transparently meritless.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch like the motion advanced by Defendant Roman, Defendant Trump\u2019s motion appears designed to generate media attention rather than accomplish some form of legitimate legal practice,\u201d Willis wrote. \u201cIt should be dismissed out of hand.\u201d\n\nMcAfee will decide the future of the Trump case\n\nIt will fall to McAfee, who has not yet set a trial date, to decide what to do. There is precedent to allow the case to continue, but some argue there is also precedent to do the opposite \u2014 a previous ruling that blocked Willis and her team from investigating Burt Jones, a 2020 Trump elector who is now Georgia\u2019s lieutenant governor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe July 2022 ruling came from Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who oversaw the special purpose grand jury that spent months investigating the efforts by Trump and his allies to try to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s win in Georgia.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nJones, then a state senator, was one of the 16 Georgia Republicans who signed a certificate falsely claiming that Trump had won the election in Georgia. He was informed by the district attorney\u2019s office in 2022 that he was a \u201ctarget\u201d in the investigation.\n\nJones asked McBurney to disqualify Willis, arguing that she had a conflict of interest because she hosted a fundraiser for Jones\u2019s eventual Democratic opponent for lieutenant governor, Charlie Bailey. Bailey, a former prosecutor, previously worked with Willis and is married to her spokeswoman, Pallavi Bailey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a hearing on the issue, McBurney criticized Willis, describing her decision to host a fundraiser for a likely opponent of a target in an investigation as a \u201cwhat are you thinking moment\u201d and \u201cproblematic\u201d to efforts to \u201cmaintain confidence that this investigation is pursuing facts in a nonpartisan sense no matter who the district attorney is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe optics are horrific,\u201d McBurney said.\n\nAnna Cross, one of the three special prosecutors on the election case, unsuccessfully sought to change McBurney\u2019s mind, arguing that Jones\u2019s attorney had not proved that Willis\u2019s behavior had legally compromised the case or was an actual conflict \u2014 an assertion similar to the arguments raised in Willis\u2019s Friday response to the latest efforts to disqualify her from the case.\n\n\u201cAppearance of a conflict isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Cross told McBurney. \u201cUnder Georgia law, the disqualification of a prosecuting attorney or entity requires an actual conflict. Not speculative, not conjecture, an actual personal interest. \u2026 While optics in this case may be more front and center than in some others, optics doesn\u2019t carry the day. It\u2019s an actual conflict.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcBurney ultimately disagreed. In his ruling he acknowledged that Willis had done nothing illegal and that elected district attorneys may engage in political activity. But he also concluded that Willis had compromised public trust in the investigation.\n\n\u201cAn investigation of this significance, garnering the public attention it necessarily does and touching so many political nerves in our society, cannot be burdened by legitimate doubts about the District Attorney\u2019s motives,\u201d McBurney wrote. \u201cThe District Attorney does not have to be apolitical, but her investigations do.\u201d\n\nThree of the 16 Republican electors were charged alongside Trump in August.\n\nThree people close to the district attorney\u2019s office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the ruling, criticized McBurney\u2019s decision, saying he had legally overstepped. But some wonder now if McBurney\u2019s caution in seeking to protect the public trust in the case could provide an avenue for his colleague, McAfee, to take the same route \u2014 finding that Willis and Wade may not have done anything legally wrong but that their actions have undermined public trust in the case.\n\nAt least one Trump co-defendant is pointing to McBurney\u2019s decision on Jones as precedent. Attorneys for Bob Cheeley, an Atlanta-area attorney facing multiple charges in the alleged election scheme, joined Roman\u2019s motion last month and cited McBurney\u2019s ruling that the mere \u201cappearance\u201d of conflict disqualified Willis from investigating Jones and that the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d now \u201crequires disqualification.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that the District Attorney has engaged in multiple, ongoing conflicts of a political and financial nature evidences a disregard of her oath to impartially and fairly exercise the enormous power vested in her office,\u201d Christopher Anulewicz and Richard Rice, Cheeley\u2019s attorneys, wrote.\n\nIn her Friday response, Willis argued that McBurney\u2019s ruling on Jones should not be \u201cbinding precedent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe elevated standard applied in that analysis was, respectfully, inconsistent with the actual legal standard Georgia appellate courts have applied for decades\u201d and \u201csheds no light\u201d on the current motions in the case, Willis wrote.\n\nIf Willis and her office were to be removed from the Trump case, the Prosecuting Attorneys\u2019 Council of Georgia, a state agency that advises local prosecutors, would be asked to find another prosecutor to take on the case. The agency has already been looking for a district attorney to take on the investigation into Jones. Peter Skandalakis, the group\u2019s executive director, said he still has not found a prosecutor to take the Jones case \u2014 a fact that does not bode well for the Trump case should it meet the same fate.\n\nWillis under investigation\n\nIf McAfee allows the case to continue \u2014 and Willis\u2019s team to stay on it \u2014 her troubles wouldn\u2019t be over. The state Senate committee that will investigate the controversy, composed of six Republicans and three Democrats, has subpoena power that it is expected to use to examine Willis\u2019s and Wade\u2019s financial records. The goal, the committee\u2019s boosters said, is to examine whether Willis misused taxpayer funds by appointing Wade while having a personal relationship with him.\n\nThe committee does not have the power to remove Willis, but it could generate uncomfortable headlines for her. And it is expected to issue recommendations that could lead to new laws affecting her position.\n\nGeorgia lawmakers also created a commission last year to police \u2014 and remove \u2014 prosecutors for misconduct, and some are calling on the commission to remove Willis. The panel is in limbo, however, because the enabling law required its rules to be approved by the Georgia Supreme Court. The court declined to approve the rules, citing separation of powers. The legislature is expected to rework the law and get the commission on its way sometime this year, after which Willis is expected to be one of its first targets.\n\nThe state ethics commission \u2014 formally known as the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission \u2014 will be responsible for weighing Greene\u2019s ethics complaint, in which she accuses Wade of failing to file required paperwork as a government vendor. Potential penalties for such violations include fines but not removal from office.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what will come of Greene\u2019s demands for a criminal investigation. Spokespeople for Kemp and Carr did not respond to requests for comment. Both resisted demands from Trump and his allies to reverse the 2020 election results, and they could be called as witnesses at trial."}

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight If the referendum passes, SUV drivers could face parking fees of more than $19.40 per hour. A few hours of shopping in the fashion capital of the world would cost over $100 just in parking fees.\n\nThe vote is the latest effort by Parisian officials to slash traffic in the French capital. Paris was one of the first big European cities to adopt bike rental programs, and last year it became the first city in Europe to ban rented electronic scooters. Two decades ago, it was rare to see cyclists in central Paris. Today, thanks to the introduction of new cycling lanes, it\u2019s not unusual to see tourists and locals alike exploring the city by bike.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo said she was targeting SUVs for reasons of road safety, air pollution and climate change. In a video posted on her Facebook page (she no longer uses X, formerly Twitter, which she calls a \u201cgigantic global sewer\u201d), Hidalgo cited a report by the World Wild Fund for Nature that said SUVs were 20 percent more polluting than average cars. She also said a pedestrian was twice as likely to be killed in a collision with an SUV than with a standard vehicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDriver advocacy groups attacked the plans.

And while harassment statutes might technically apply, they often require multiple offenses and are tricky to prove.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome urge caution in declaring these real crimes, despite genuine harms.\n\n\u201cPeople kill each other all the time in video games but we don\u2019t call them murderers,\u201d said Aya Gruber, a law professor at the University of Southern California who has studied rape laws and called jail a \u201cblunt tool\u201d for addressing online behavior.\n\nOthers say the situation is urgent and demands immediate protocols. Dan Barry, an investigations specialist at the Zero Abuse Project, set up a test profile mimicking a 13-year old girl on VRChat, a virtual reality program. Almost immediately, the girl\u2019s avatar was greeted by male avatars, who made sexual comments and asked her to chat privately.\n\n\u201cThat child could be [sexually] assaulted by [an] adult,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are not a lot of controls in these spaces.\u201d\n\nThese challenges arise as major technology companies are investing billions of dollars into virtual reality programs, aiming to transform them into a new computing platform. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said virtual and augmented reality powered devices will eventually replace mobile phones and some in-person communication. Apple\u2019s virtual reality headset, Vision Pro, went on sale Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of the earliest adopters of virtual reality came from the video game industry \u2014 a sector that has struggled with racism, sexism and harassment. These issues exploded into the public in the 2014 phenomenon known as \u201cgamergate,\u201d when internet trolls organized to harass women in gaming circles.\n\nExperts say these issues have migrated to social VR apps, where users interact with each other in virtual bars, concerts and event spaces. One 2018 study found that 49 percent of women who regularly used VR reported experiencing at least one instance of sexual harassment.\n\nFor people who use VR harassment \u201cis a growing concern,\u201d said Clemson University professor Guo Freeman, author of a forthcoming study on harassment in the metaverse. \u201cSome people actually told us they would quit\u201d because of the abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExperts say the immersive nature of virtual reality can make online attacks feel real. Researchers use the phrase \u201cembodiment\u201d to describe the intimate connection people feel with their digital avatar. Headsets from Apple and Meta with advanced audio and \u201ceye-tracking\u201d enhance this feeling, by making virtual experiences seem real.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cThis type of immersive and embodied experience [makes] harassing behavior feel as realistic as in the physical world,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cIt\u2019s like my offline body is attacked because it feels so real. It\u2019s like someone is touching me.\u201d\n\nPatel said that she logically knows her attack happened to a digital avatar, hearing the voices of her attackers in her ear made it feel like it was happening to her body.\n\nWhile victims might suffer profound emotional impacts, it\u2019s unlikely that law enforcement and courts will interpret these experiences similarly. Most legal definitions of rape require a physical sexual act to have occurred in order for prosecutors to pursue a case, said John Bandler, a lawyer specializing in cybersecurity and former assistant district attorney at the New York County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a rape as defined in the criminal law,\u201d Bandler said of attacks in virtual reality. \u201cIt\u2019s not an act in the physical world.\u201d\n\nExperts said it might be possible to prosecute offenders under a lesser harassment charge. But those charges are often made when the perpetrator has committed multiple offenses over time, said Mary Anne Franks, a George Washington Law School professor.\n\n\u201cTo rise to the level of something criminal, [a perpetrator] would have to have done something repeatedly \u2014 that is follow this person home or they show up at work the next day,\u201d Franks said. \u201cAnd online too, there would need to be more than just one incident, where someone has been aggressive.\u201d\n\nFranks added that law enforcement agencies have historically not always prioritized harassment cases in the physical world and might be even more reluctant to devote extensive resources to investigate virtual incidents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long standing view that these kinds of assaults \u2014 this kind of abuse \u2014 isn\u2019t as real and not as serious,\u201d she said.\n\nMany caution that more research is needed to understand the impact of criminal or unethical behavior in VR before it\u2019s criminalized.\n\nSoon after her attack, Patel wrote about her experience on Medium and she was bombarded with emails telling her she was \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d to call her experience an assault."}

So many young girls, and boys, were in the crowd. And bless their little hearts, they don\u2019t know better. In their eyes, they got to see a very cool basketball player and the buzzy atmosphere she creates, the boos of mixed hostility and admiration and the thunderbolts of shouts and applause. It was a scene, and yet for the youngest fans on Saturday night, completely normal.\n\nFar greater than Clark adding 38 points to her career total and moving 66 points from the all-time NCAA women\u2019s scoring title, as she led No. 3 Iowa to a 93-85 win over Maryland, was her chiseling yet another inch from the barrier that obscures the women\u2019s game from mainstream audiences. When Clark, a senior who still has one more year of eligibility remaining, decides to walk away from her stately seat in college, she will leave a trail of logo threes, delicious dimes and eloquent news conferences that should be imitated by the ballers coming behind her. The next generation has the template. All they have to do is watch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFox Sports did a solid for its college basketball viewing audience by bumping the Iowa-Maryland game to the prime time slot at 8 p.m. Eastern. The network even dedicated a camera that followed Clark while she created her latest masterpiece and live-streamed it on TikTok \u2014 Ohmygah did she get her first touch of the game beyond the cursive script of \u201cGary Williams Court\u201d and then take one dribble into a deep three over the outstretched hand of Lavender Briggs?!? Fire emoji!\n\nOn Feb. 11, when Iowa visits Nebraska, Clark will serve as an appetizing prelude to Super Bowl Sunday on Fox Sports. Then, three of her five remaining regular season games will be streamed on Peacock. As tennis star Frances Tiafoe, who switched up his schedule so he could watch Clark from his courtside seat Saturday, summed it up: \u201cShe\u2019s box office.\u201d Networks understand this, and have featured her as the brightest star in college basketball over the last two years.\n\nClark\u2019s games have been more accessible than the college work of Kelsey Plum, who set the scoring record while at Washington. Plum was and is an amazing player. But her time did not meet this moment, where there\u2019s more attention on women\u2019s sports. Same for Sabrina Ionescu. Same for Sue Bird. And Diana Taurasi, Candace Parker, Carol Blazejowski. And those USC legends whose greatness can only be seen through standard definition pixels: Lisa Leslie, Cheryl Miller and Cynthia Cooper.\n\nSo while it might seem like recency bias to crown Clark, in this case, give her her flowers. GOAT her. And as we\u2019re enjoying her singular talent, understand how one woman can change and positively impact a whole generation.\n\nFor many old heads in the building, Saturday night felt bigger than a game. The kind of atmosphere we\u2019ve only seen in men\u2019s basketball. The Maryland student section geared up every time Clark touched the ball, but even in their chorus of boos was the throb of anticipation. A boo that wanted to say much more: We kinda have to hate you because you\u2019re not a Terp and stuff, but you\u2019re literally the reason we\u2019re here on this Saturday night \u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had to watch myself from committing fits of uncontrolled violence against my colleague and seat neighbor Kareem Copeland. You\u2019re not supposed to cheer from press row, kids, and I kept my dignity. But when Clark came down court in the closing seconds of the first half, hit 'em with a behind-the-back dribble to her left, then spun from the top of the key to her right, stepped through and banked in a shot while getting fouled, I might have turned and grabbed Copeland, needing to brace myself because that move nearly took me out of my seat.\n\nI watched a dad react to another play; thankfully for his daughter, his was a bit more understated. When Clark delivered a bounce pass to a cutting teammate, one of her 12 assists, that led to an open layup from the left block, the father turned to his little girl and shook his head. Maybe in disbelief, because she makes the game of basketball look so easy, so pure, so fun \u2014 and at times, even so pouty. Many times, Clark acts like your favorite NBA player, complaining about fouls and no calls. Alas, witnessing greatness also means witnessing human frailty.\n\nAfter the game, as she entered the cramped interview room, two uniformed and armed police officers from Iowa escorted her. They follow her everywhere, too. Her celebrity has grown, and so cautious protection has become necessary. But as she sat and fielded questions about being an avatar for kids to look up to and growing the women\u2019s game \u2014 how many other players in college sports have to tackle such meaty topics? \u2014 Clark seemed at ease in embracing her power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the privileges in being in the position that I am, is that I get to be a role model and our whole entire team gets to be role models. People look up to us,\u201d Clark said. \u201cYoung girls, young boys, no matter who they are. I think the thing I would just say to them is the same thing I\u2019ve said all my career, is just \u2018dream big.\u2019 I came to Iowa with huge aspirations and now I\u2019m getting to play in front of 15,000-plus every single night and that\u2019s so cool. Those are moments that you can really only dream of and now I\u2019m living it every single day of my life and that\u2019s really special.\u201d"}

The others screamed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here for an hour and you\u2019re saying this now?\u201d\n\nThe women belong to the Hill Swifties, a group chat of congressional worker bees who adore the pop star and who occasionally let their fandom out at work by sneaking Swift references into their bosses\u2019 press releases \u2014 or, conversely, talking those bosses out of posting cringeworthy Taylor content. After all, it\u2019s easy to appropriate Swiftisms poorly in Washington. The State Department\u2019s \u2018Eras Tour\u2019-themed checklist for international travel? That was good. The FBI\u2019s tip line tweet cloaked in the aesthetics of Swift\u2019s album \u201cSpeak Now,\u201d encouraging citizens who \u201chave information about a federal crime\u201d to \u201cspeak now?\u201d Not so good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe staffers \u2014 who allowed The Washington Post to join their conversation on the condition that it not use their names, so nobody mistakes their personal views for their bosses\u2019 \u2014 have been fans of Swift almost as long as they\u2019ve been alive.

Her latest appearance at one of Kelce\u2019s games \u2014 a playoff win that sent his team to the Super Bowl \u2014 coincided with murmurs that President Biden\u2019s campaign may be courting her support.

On the right: speculation that Swift and her \u201cvaccine shill boyfriend\u201d \u2014 a reference to Kelce\u2019s advertisements for the coronavirus vaccine \u2014 are a \u201cpsyop\u201d (spy-world shorthand for a psychological operation) to throw the election to Biden.\n\nSwift, meanwhile, has very much excluded herself from the narrative\u200b: She has not weighed in publicly on the endorsement chatter, and a publicist for Swift did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTeam Biden is playing any Swift strategy close to the vest: A campaign and White House spokesperson both declined to comment on Swift-specific outreach. \u201cI have no idea if Taylor Swift would actively offer herself or not, but of course, he\u2019d love to have her endorsement,\u201d said Mitch Landrieu, a co-chair of the Biden reelection campaign who said he loves Swift and also Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the president, a fan of Irish folk music, knows or cares about Swift, whose name he appeared to confuse with Britney Spears\u2019s during remarks at last year\u2019s presidential turkey pardon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating the president has fallen to his die-hard Swiftie staffers. On a day that music manager Scooter Braun visited the White House, former Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield found herself inadvertently briefing the president about Swift\u2019s bad blood with Braun over control of her master recordings. As Biden\u2019s team prepped the president in the Oval Office for the upcoming meeting, Bedingfield stepped forward.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Sir, this is the briefing I was born for!\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nAn unequivocal endorsement for Biden\u2019s reelection from Swift could matter, says Bedingfield, especially to her fans who aren\u2019t deeply engaged in politics. \u201cUltimately knowing what she has told us \u2014 us the public \u2014 about how she feels about issues, I think it would be more powerful for her to say, \u2018These are the stakes in this election, and here\u2019s why I\u2019m going to vote Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and I hope you will, too,\u2019\u201d Bedingfield said.\n\nBidenworld has been inundated with suggestions for how to try to make a Swift endorsement happen \u2014 from the person who claimed they had a secret plan with their lawyers that would soon be making its way to Swift\u2019s lawyers, to the person who claimed their brother had played on the same basketball team as Swift\u2019s brother back in Pennsylvania \u2014 a swing state! \u2014 and perhaps that could be an in. Supporters regularly send aides the latest paparazzi snaps of Swift and her friends out on the town \u2014 just in case someone knows someone who knows someone who knows Swift!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden\u2019s team was particularly miffed to see a suggestion from a well-meaning supporter, that Biden just show up to a Swift concert, circulating in recent news reports. The logistics alone \u2014 Secret Service, getting concertgoers through the security line \u2014 would create the sort of headache that could alienate the very Swifties they\u2019re trying to woo.\n\nBecause anyone who knows how Swift operates understands that any meaningful Swift endorsement has to be authentic and on her terms.\n\n\u201cDo not seek it,\u201d warned a Hill Swiftie at the Capitol Hill bar. \u201cShe does these things on her own, based on the side of history she wants to be on.\u201d\n\nOnce upon a time, a few Eras ago, Taylor Swift was a teenage country music star who never, ever, ever discussed her politics. It was up to obsessive fans to glean what they could from her lyrics and social media posts. \u201cThere was this whole portion of the fandom who would examine her old posts, figure out who her friends were and find out if they\u2019d said anything political,\u2019\u201d says Lauren Lipman, a Taylor Swift influencer who discusses the pop queen on her YouTube channel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWhenever she was asked about her politics, Swift would demur. \u201cIt\u2019s my right to vote, but it\u2019s not my right to tell other people what to do,\u201d a 24-year-old Swift told David Letterman in 2014. Members of Congress from both parties held fundraisers at her D.C. stop for her \u201c1989\u201d tour in 2015. When some of her famous friends became outspoken surrogates for Hillary Clinton, campaign staffers wondered if Swift herself would endorse Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent \u2014 and were ultimately disappointed when she didn\u2019t.\n\nSwift would come to regret her silence. In \u201cMiss Americana,\u201d a documentary that chronicles Swift\u2019s political coming-out, the pop star points to her 2017 sexual assault lawsuit against a Denver DJ as a political awakening. (Swift won the suit, which charged that the DJ had groped her at an event in 2013.) The experience left her \u201ccompletely and unchangeably different,\u201d she says in the documentary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI just thought to myself, \u2018Next time there is any opportunity to change anything, you had better know what you stand for and what you want to say,\u2019\u201d she adds.\n\nNext time arrived during the 2018 midterms. She offered her first political endorsements \u2014 to a pair of Tennessee Democrats: Bredesen, who was running for U.S. Senate against Republican Marsha Blackburn, and Jim Cooper, then a U.S. representative running for reelection. (Cooper, a 17-term incumbent, won his race; Bredesen lost.)\n\nLisa Quigley, who served as Cooper\u2019s chief of staff, remembers being caught off guard by the endorsement; she was at home and her phone just started \u201cblowing up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember Jim being like, \u2018That\u2019s nice,\u2019\u201d Quigley says of her boss\u2019s reaction to the news. \u201cThen he called back and said, \u2018My daughter says this is a very big deal.\u2019\u201d\n\nLaura Zapata, the communications director for Bredesen\u2019s Senate campaign, had been driving back from a campaign event when a friend alerted her to Swift\u2019s Instagram announcement.\n\nSwift never spoke with either campaign; Zapata says that she and Swift interacted exclusively through Instagram, liking and reposting each other\u2019s political content. \u201cIt was very millennial,\u201d Zapata says. (Blackburn\u2019s 2024 opponent, Democrat Gloria Johnson, is not playing it coy: \u201cI\u2019m a big fan, and we are reaching out,\u201d she says of Swift.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwift similarly surprised the Biden campaign in 2020 when she posted an emphatic \u201cYES\u201d in response to then-Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s announcement that she\u2019d been chosen as Biden\u2019s running mate. Swift would later formally endorse, sharing a photo with cookies frosted with the Biden-Harris campaign logo. She also gave Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) permission to use her song \u201cOnly the Young\u201d in a pro-Biden super PAC advertisement that year, according to Variety. How Swalwell got Swift\u2019s cooperation, he\u2019ll never tell: \"You\u2019re asking Colonel Sanders the recipe for the chicken,\u201d Swalwell said when asked.\n\nMarquee names mattered a lot to Biden in 2020, a year when nearly all of the campaigning had been done virtually. The 2024 campaign will have a different feel, and particular types of celebrities will be called upon for every reason, every season. The campaign surrogate operation, for instance, is keeping tabs on hip-hop artists in Atlanta, and lists of bands that are influential in Wisconsin, a swing state with a strong local music culture. Big names like Swift will be called upon, the campaign hopes, for a moment in the fall to lend a jolt of excitement to voter registration or get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nAs for the coveted Swift endorsement, some Democratic Swifties are nervous about all the members of their party who are talking explicitly about wanting the pop star to boost Biden \u2014 and whether if it\u2019s cool that they\u2019ve said all that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want us to overdo it,\u201d says Annie Wu Henry, who, as a social media producer for Democrat John Fetterman\u2019s 2022 campaign for Senate in Pennsylvania, leaned on Swift references in the candidate\u2019s social posts. \u201cI want us to be aware of how we\u2019re coming off publicly,\u201d Wu, now a digital communications strategist for various Democrats and organizations, says. \u201cAll of this conversation is giving me the ick.\u201d\n\nThe recent Swift backlash on the right \u2014 dominated by a vocal, mostly male, minority \u2014 has been giving some conservatives the ick, regardless of whether they\u2019re fans of Swift.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis \u2018psyop\u2019 stuff makes us look QAnon crazy,\u201d says Alex Clark, a hardcore Swiftie who hosts a pop culture podcast for Turning Point USA, a right-wing youth organization. \u201cThe left tries to say we\u2019re insane, and this doesn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we looked at these pop culture topics with a spirit of inquisitiveness instead of lampooning them as psyops, then maybe more young people would listen to what we have to say,\u201d says Mary Morgan, a Gen Z conservative who hosts a pop culture YouTube show and isn\u2019t a fan of Swift.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the kind of criticism that gives weight to the left-wing stereotype that conservative men don\u2019t support women,\u201d says Vanessa Santos, a conservative millennial and non-Swiftie who runs a publicity firm in D.C.\n\nThe Hill Swifties have a nuanced view of Swift\u2019s power as a political actor. To them, that power doesn\u2019t necessarily have to do with naming her preferred candidates.\n\nTheir group chat is actually a spinoff of another \u2014 one dedicated to queer women staffers on the Hill. Swift\u2019s advocacy on LGBTQ+ rights has been meaningful to members of both chats. One of them recalls crying when she saw Swift cast a trans man as her love interest in her music video for her song \u201cLavender Haze.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe she can\u2019t convince a Republican to vote for Joe Biden,\u201d one Hill Swiftie said, \u201cbut she could convince them that trans people are people.\u201d"}

And this year, he is doing a 14-city tour across the United States.\n\nThe New Yorker\u2019s Kelefa Sanneh profiled Gillis in 2022, describing him as an \u201cunpredictable\u201d comedian who delights in the strong reactions of his audience but is at times uncomfortable with the support that his removal from SNL and style of humor have garnered him among conservatives and \u201caudience members who prized offensive speech for its own sake.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanneh pointed out that other comedians who have faced backlash or lost jobs or opportunities because of past remarks have pivoted to making jokes about their situation and casting themselves as defenders of free speech. But Gillis did not: According to Sanneh, Gillis told the podcast host Joe Rogan in 2021, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a victim \u2014 I want to be a comedian.\u201d He said he did not want his comedy to be about how he was treated. \u201cI understand why I was treated that way,\u201d he told the New Yorker, adding that he intended to keep making \u201cwild\u201d statements.\n\nOn social media, the announcement of Gillis as host sparked mixed reactions, with fans of the comedian praising his return and others criticizing SNL producers for bringing him back.\n\nSome social media users argued it was an ill-timed move to elevate a comedian accused of racial insensitivity during Black History Month. Some also criticized the show for bringing on Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Feb. 3 for a skit in which she said she \u201cprobably should have said\u201d that slavery was the main cause of the Civil War \u2014 a reference to her failure to mention it during a town hall with voters on the campaign trail last year."}

Though free filing options have always existed, most Americans buy software or hire a preparer to do the job.\n\nThe new Direct File program is the Biden administration\u2019s big gamble to shake up this practice by establishing a free competitor to behemoths like Intuit\u2019s TurboTax and H&R Block.\n\nBut Direct File, which uses a question-and-answer format much like those paid websites, is a far cry from what some proponents of free tax software have sought. It doesn\u2019t draw from the IRS\u2019s vast trove of financial information on each taxpayer, including W-2 wage statements. Some had envisioned that a government platform would offer pre-filled returns to save users time and effort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2022 study whose co-authors included Treasury and Federal Reserve economists underscored the potential for such a platform, concluding that the IRS has enough information to correctly tally about 45 percent of tax returns without any input from the taxpayers themselves.\n\nEconomist William Gale, director of the Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution, says many countries already have some form of pre-filled returns. \u201cThis is not some flying car technology that only exists in people\u2019s minds,\u201d Gale said.\n\nAn underlying challenge is political and industry opposition. Republicans would probably oppose any expansion of the IRS\u2019s authority, including Direct File, which is currently billed as a one-year pilot program. Commercial tax prep companies would lobby against it as well, as the industry has lobbied against other tax simplification efforts.\n\nCost concerns\n\nWhile some lawmakers such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have long pushed for an IRS free-filing website, Congress never authorized Direct File. Instead, Democrats included a provision in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to allocate $15 million to study whether taxpayers might want a government filing option, and whether the government could create it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IRS spent some of those funds on the study, which it submitted to Congress in May. It then spent the rest, supplemented by other parts of its budget, to build the platform, which it describes as essentially part of the study.\n\nThat workaround has drawn the ire of Republicans, including House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason T. Smith (R-Mo.). \u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s so-called \u2018study\u2019 into establishing a direct e-file system was a foregone conclusion designed to further their goal of inserting the IRS into every aspect of Americans\u2019 lives,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nRepublican attorneys general from 12 states sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen last week arguing that the IRS should not have been allowed to create the site without Congress\u2019s direction and urging her to end the program. In addition to questioning the program\u2019s legality, they raised the issue of paid preparers who might lose business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMillions of Americans work with small businesses in our states to file their taxes at an affordable cost, including both independent tax preparation services and local accountants,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe Direct File program needlessly threatens the livelihood of thousands of these small businesses tax preparers.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIn its report to Congress, the tax agency forecast that a government-built site would cost $64 million (for about 5 million users) to $249 million (for about 25 million users) per year to run, largely due to customer service costs. Last month, however, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said it would be \u201cpremature\u201d to tally the total cost of building the site, noting that the IRS also relied on workers from other agencies, including the General Services Administration and the U.S. Digital Service, on the project.\n\nA U.S. Digital Service official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the website before its debut, said the team kept growing from the day they started coding in May, reaching about 100 government employees and contractors now working on the software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCost concerns have been raised even internally. An IRS advisory committee cautioned against creating a proprietary tax platform as recently as June. Instead, it said, it would be more efficient for the IRS to prioritize publicizing its existing and underused \u201cFree File\u201d option \u2014 a separate offering in which commercial tax prep companies provide free services to low- and middle-income taxpayers. Only about 3 percent of eligible taxpayers use Free File, in part because the companies divert many users from the free version to a paid option.\n\nTim Hugo, who runs the Free File Alliance that provides the commercial software, said he was \u201cperplexed\u201d that the IRS would build its own site. \u201cWhen you have a program here that\u2019s free, that\u2019s been up and running for 21 years \u2014 that costs the IRS nothing. And yet you\u2019re going to spend huge sums on Direct File.\u201d\n\nMany advocates, however, say they don\u2019t think the existing Free File program can be greatly improved and are eager to promote Direct File as a new option. The tax software companies \u201chad their chance for years to actually provide Americans with a credible way of filing their taxes for free [with Free File], and they have failed,\u201d said Igor Volsky, executive director of the advocacy group Groundwork Action. His organization will buy ads to promote Direct File in the states where it will debut.\n\n1,000 data points\n\nIn its first iteration, Direct File will become available in 12 states, covering more than 40 percent of U.S. taxpayers. But many taxpayers in those states will be ineligible: for example, the roughly 1 in 5 households with a self-employed worker, or the 1 in 10 taxpayers who itemize. Few will be excluded based on income \u2014 the program allows individuals with wages up to $200,000, or couples up to $250,000 \u2014 but others might not qualify if they bought health insurance on the government marketplace, purchased cryptocurrency or claimed certain credits like those for child care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIRS officials say they expect hundreds of thousands of taxpayers using the new Direct File website, a tiny fraction of the more than 140 million households that file tax returns.\n\nIn January presentations to journalists, agency officials showed a map of every question that the site might have to ask a taxpayer, totaling more than 1,000 data points. Expanding to cover more tax situations would mean enlarging that map. Pre-filling taxpayers\u2019 information would be another sort of challenge.\n\nDavidson Gillette, an East Carolina University professor who has researched other countries\u2019 pre-filled returns, said he views the largest hurdle to be the American practice of joint filing, which makes it harder for the government to know who owes how much. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear if the IRS would be capable of bearing that additional burden \u2026 with the level of funding they have,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne lesson may be California\u2019s program almost 20 years ago, when it sent pre-filled returns to some households. Critics of Direct File point to that experiment as a cautionary tale \u2014 nearly 80 percent of the taxpayers who got the pre-filled return chose not to use it, and fierce opposition from the tax prep industry scuttled the effort.\n\nThe project was led by Joseph Bankman, the Stanford tax law professor who is now better known as the father of disgraced cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried. Despite the experiment\u2019s response rate, he still backs the idea on a national scale."}

They say blockchain technology could be the bedrock of Web3, a catch-all term for a decentralized next generation of the internet that shifts control from Big Tech companies to the users themselves. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology would likely be ubiquitous in Web3, making the internet a much more useful, powerful and adaptive tool for all users.\n\nUnfortunately, the concept of Web3 is still in its infancy at this point, so stocks focused exclusively on blockchain technology, the metaverse and building Web3 infrastructure are likely facing a difficult and risky road ahead. Web3 is also more of an idea and narrative than an actual network at this point, adding more risk and uncertainty to the equation.\n\n\n\nSome of the best-performing stocks of the past two decades \u2013 such as Meta Platforms Inc. (ticker: META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Netflix Inc. (NFLX) \u2013 played a central role in the way we currently interact with the web, and investors who identify Web3 stocks early could generate some equally massive returns.\n\nHere are five of the best Web3 stocks to buy today, according to Bank of America analysts:\n\n\n\nStock Implied upside over Feb. 1 close Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) 11.1% Meta Platforms Inc. (META) 7.7% Block Inc. (SQ) 27.5% Roblox Corp. (RBLX) 37.3% Unity Software Inc. (U) 72%\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNvidia designs and sells high-end graphics and video processing chips used for desktop and gaming personal computers, workstations, and other advanced computing servers and supercomputers. No matter what form Web3 ultimately takes, it will most likely require a tremendous amount of processing power supplied by Nvidia chips.\n\nThe Nvidia Omniverse is a computing platform that enables development of Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)-based 3D workflows and applications, allowing creators to build custom extensions, tools and metaverse applications using little-to-no coding.\n\nAnalyst Vivek Arya projects all of Nvidia's demand catalysts will allow the company to maintain at least 22% annual revenue growth through at least 2026.\n\n\"We believe NVDA is still in the first (approximately) 25% of converting the $250 (billion) of global compute infrastructure to accelerated/AI computing,\" Arya said in a research note.\n\nBank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $700 price target for NVDA stock, which closed at $630.27 on Feb. 1.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (META)\n\nMeta Platforms owns and operates some of the world's largest social media and messaging platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram.\n\nMeta has emerged as one of the biggest winners from the current iteration of the internet, and its control and use of user data, controversy surrounding user privacy and content censorship are often cited by Web3 proponents as motivation for building a more decentralized web. But Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has always had a strong vision for the future of the internet, and the company has shifted its focus to building a metaverse that incorporates blockchain and AI technology, as well as virtual and augmented reality features.\n\n\"With a favorable macro backdrop for advertising, Reels contribution turning positive in 2024, a large messaging revenue ramp in progress, strong AI assets driving results and still plenty of costs to cut if needed, we remain constructive on the stock,\" analyst Justin Post wrote in a note.\n\nBank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $425 price target for META stock, which closed at $394.78 on Feb. 1.\n\n\n\nBlock Inc. (SQ)\n\nBlock is a financial services and digital payments company and is the parent of the Square payments platform for businesses and the Cash App digital payments app. Block allows Bitcoin trading through its Cash App and holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet as an alternative to cash.\n\nBlock was a pioneer in decentralized, peer-to-peer payments, and decentralized finance (DeFi) will likely play a core role in Web3. Block's Spiral subsidiary builds and funds free, open-source projects specifically aimed at making Bitcoin the world's leading currency.\n\nAnalyst Jason Kupferberg says Block's management team has refocused on improving execution heading into 2024.\n\n\"We remain confident in (Block's) business model quality, expect to see results from SQ's refocused strategy and believe shares are undervalued,\" Kupferberg wrote in a note.\n\nBank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $85 price target for SQ stock, which closed at $66.67 on Feb. 1.\n\nRoblox Corp. (RBLX)\n\nRoblox is an online entertainment platform that allows creators to develop games, and it may be the closest thing to a functioning metaverse today. Roblox had 70.2 million daily active users as of the third quarter, its own digital currency and a range of unique virtual experiences. About half its users are under age 13, potentially positioning the company very well for the future, including Web3.\n\nRoblox CEO David Baszucki has seemingly embraced the Web3 principles of decentralization and interoperability, recently telling CNBC that blockchain-based non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, and other digital assets could eventually move seamlessly across the Roblox ecosystem, including to and from other Web3 platforms.\n\nAnalyst Omar Dessouky wrote that Roblox is \"a clear metaverse and (user-generated content) leader that we expect to grow faster in the next five years than any other gaming or social media asset.\"\n\nBank of America has a \"buy\" rating and $54 price target for RBLX stock, which closed at $39.33 on Feb. 1.\n\nUnity Software Inc. (U)\n\nUnity Software owns one of the two main 3D video game engines, which allows designers to customize how video game players move and interact within their games.\n\nIn 2023, Unity added a new decentralization category page in its Unity Asset Store, which contains solutions to support developers focused on enabling decentralization in gaming. Many gaming enthusiasts and investors envision the Web3 version of online gaming will include in-game ownership models that allow players to earn, create or obtain in-game resources that they can then sell and trade within or across different networks using blockchain technology.\n\nAnalyst Michael Funk projects Unity will continue to generate annual revenue growth in the double-digit percentage range for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Improved monetization of U's industry leading mobile game creation engine paired with a stabilizing mobile game advertising market create a compelling risk-reward profile, in our view,\" Funk wrote."}

Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, has clashed with Biden over the state's aggressive tactics to deter crossers, including troops, concertina wire and a floating buoy barrier in the Rio Grande.\n\nAbbott and 14 other Republican governors plan to hold a press conference in the city on Sunday to defend the approach.\n\nReuters witnesses saw small groups of migrants on Friday and Saturday who crossed the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass trapped by concertina wire on the riverbank as they waited for help.\n\nWhile Saturday's rally proceeded peacefully, the FBI identified a threat to a migrant processing center in Eagle Pass, leading U.S. border officials to evacuate it in recent days, two sources familiar with the matter said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal information.\n\n\"Any threat like that is a significant concern,\" a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official told Reuters.\n\nThe agency was able to relocate the migrants with relative ease since border apprehensions have fallen sharply in the area over the past month, the official said.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment, referring the matter to CBP.\n\nBiden on Saturday afternoon discussed border challenges with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and committed to continuing \"joint efforts to counter transnational criminal organizations involved in the illicit trafficking of drugs, guns, and people,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nThe \"Take Our Border Back\" protest began with a vehicle convoy from Virginia that rolled into Quemado on Friday night.\n\nDennis Barnd, 61, drove with his wife from Ohio to Texas to link up with a convoy in part because of its conservative Christian message.\n\n\"I live in a remote part of the country where there's not a lot of activism and whatnot, and it's moving to see so many people come together with a good common cause,\" he said.\n\nAdam Chavin, 39, donning a shirt bearing Trump's likeness, flew in from Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\"I'm actually trying to do stuff,\" he said. \"I'm not just someone talking, someone posting comments on the internet.\"\n\nAnna Gabriela Derbez, a 56-year-old Eagle Pass resident at the border event, said immigration was one of several issues - including COVID-19 vaccines, artificial intelligence and LGBTQ education - that were part of \"a fight of good versus evil.\"\n\n\"We're for immigration,\" said Derbez, whose grandparents came to the U.S. from Mexico. \"Legal immigration, you know, good immigration, people that are coming and want to work and better a place.\"\n\nSmaller events were planned in Yuma, Arizona, and San Ysidro, California.\n\nOn Thursday, conservative personalities Sarah Palin, a former Republican vice presidential candidate, and Ted Nugent, a rock musician and outspoken gun rights proponent, joined the protest as the convoy overnighted further north in Dripping Springs, Texas.\n\nNugent called Biden a \"devil-scum snake\" in a caustic speech before performing the U.S. national anthem on guitar.\n\nMinnesota-based pastor Doug Pagitt tried to enter the rally site on Friday after stopping in the area as part of a tour to combat what he calls \"Christian nationalism,\" but was denied entry as participants told him \"you're not wanted.\"\n\n\"We want to engage,\" Pagitt said afterward.\n\nThe number of migrants arrested trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border has climbed to record highs since Biden took office in 2021. While migrant arrests spiked in December, they have dropped steeply in the past month.\n\nInternal CBP statistics reviewed by Reuters showed 216 migrant arrests on Tuesday across the entire Del Rio Sector, which covers a 245-mile (400-km) stretch of the Rio Grande and encompasses Eagle Pass. In mid-December, that figure at times topped 4,000 per day, internal figures show.\n\nU.S. officials have cautioned the slowdown could be seasonal although the Mexican government also increased enforcement.\n\n(Reporting by Ted Hesson and Maria Alejandra Cardona in Quemado; Additional reporting by Go Nakamura in Quemado and Helen Coster in New York City; Editing by William Mallard, Daniel Wallis, David Gregorio and Jonathan Oatis)"}

(AP) \u2014 Anthony Oropeza still remembers the day Travis Kelce walked into his studio at the InterUrban ArtHouse in suburban Kansas City, where some of his acrylic and mixed media works were hanging from the walls.\n\nKelce was helping to deliver a grant for the community arts hub, and the first piece to grab his attention featured Satchel Paige, the Hall of Fame Negro Leagues pitcher who later played in Cleveland, near where the Chiefs tight end had grown up.\n\nThen, Kelce saw Oropeza's painting entitled \u201c:13 seconds,\u201d which depicted the dramatic finish to the Chiefs' game against Buffalo in 2022. Kelce made a crucial catch to move Kansas City within range of a tying field goal in their divisional playoff game, then he caught the touchdown pass in overtime that sent the Chiefs back to the AFC championship game.\n\n\u201cThat right there,\u201d Kelce told Oropeza, \u201clooks familiar.\u201d\n\nOropeza's work has caught the attention of more than just Kelce in recent years. He's done commissions for Jarrod Dyson of the Kansas City Royals and the wife of former St. Louis Cardinals slugger Albert Pujols. But the vast majority of his work focuses on the Chiefs, which has helped him supplement his 9-to-5 job working for the local parks and recreation department.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\n\u201cThe success of the Chiefs, or more specifically the success and greatness of Patrick Mahomes, has definitely helped my career,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helped me pay for my kids' education. Helped me meet some of the best Chiefs fans around.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the sustained excellence of the Chiefs, who play the San Francisco 49ers next Sunday in their fourth Super Bowl in five years, has been crucial to the bottom line of dozens \u2014 if not hundreds \u2014 of small businesses such as Oropeza's art studio.\n\nIn December, Econsult Solutions Inc. estimated the total annual economic impact by the Chiefs on team and Arrowhead Stadium operations, as well as ancillary spending of non-local attendees of games and events, at just shy of $1 billion.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly proud of our 60-plus-year connection to the Kansas City region,\u201d Chiefs president Mark Donovan said in a statement. \u201cWe know that the franchise and the stadium are key economic drivers.\"\n\nNot just for big companies but small T-shirt companies, bakeries and even local artists.\n\nTake RAYGUN, an irreverent apparel company with locations across the Midwest, which has T-shirts that feature such cheeky sayings as, \u201cI Cheered For Kansas City Before It Was Cool\u201d and \u201cGo Taylor Swift's Boyfriend\u201d \u2014 a nod to Kelce, of course, whose relationship with pop superstar Taylor Swift has likewise proven to be quite profitable.\n\nCharlie Hustle, another local apparel company, pays homage to her with hoodies and shirts that say, \u201cIn My Red Era.\u201d\n\nDolce Bakery, in the suburb of Prairie Village, Kansas, has an entire \u201cSwiftie Collection\u201d of heart-shaped cakes, along with an even more extensive menu of Chiefs-related cookies and treats. Cakes are decorated to resemble Mahomes, complete with his signature curly hair, and coach Andy Reid, whose mustache and glasses are featured quite prominently.\n\n\u201cJanuary and February are historically quieter months for us,\u201d Dolce Bakery founder Erin Brown said, \u201cbut these Super Bowl years have allowed our creative team to churn out freshly baked Chiefs designs that the Kansas City community has loved.\u201d\n\nThe very nature of small businesses allows them to pivot quickly, too. So when the Chiefs beat the Ravens to book their place in the Super Bowl in Las Vegas, Dolce produced a cake that reads \u201cWelcome to the Kingdom,\u201d but in the styling of \u201cThe Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\u201d sign that has greeted visitors to the Strip for more than six decades.\n\n\u201cAs devoted fans ourselves,\u201d Brown explained, \u201cit's given us an opportunity to connect with our regular customers and reach new ones through our collective passion and support for the Chiefs.\u201d\n\nAfter the Chiefs beat the Bills in the divisional round, when Kelce's brother, Jason Kelce, famously stripped off his shirt and hopped out of his suite to celebrate, the bakers at Eileen's Colossal Cookies in Liberty, Missouri, took notice. They decorated a cookie cake in the spitting image of the Eagles center, and pictures of it posted to social media quickly went viral.\n\nAnother bakery, McLain's, noticed when Reid's bushy mustache froze during the Chiefs' wild-card win over Miami, the fourth-coldest game played in NFL history.\n\nSo they began offering a slightly tweaked version of their own Reid-inspired cake called the \u201cAndy Reidcicle Cake,\u201d where his mustache looks as if it is icicles.\n\nThose are just some of the small businesses that have benefited from what has become a robust Chiefs industry.\n\n\u201cIt's helped me help my community, too,\" added Oropeza, the artist whose studio Kelce visited that day. Along with original work, he does live paintings for charity fundraisers, and some of his Chiefs-related pieces have gone for thousands of dollars.\n\n\u201cThe biggest highlight of it all,\u201d Oropeza admitted, \u201cwas when my daughter met Travis that day, surrounded by all of my paintings. Her meeting him put the biggest smile on her face that I had ever seen. And as a dad, seeing your kid smile that wide made all the late nights \u2014 4-hours-of-sleep nights \u2014 and all the other sacrifices for the past 10 years well worth it.\u201d\n\n___"}

The Canucks got Elias Lindholm from Calgary, the Jets got fellow center Sean Monahan from Montreal and much more activity is expected before the March 8 trade deadline.\n\nMuch like last year when Vancouver sent Bo Horvat to the New York Islanders, the wheeling and dealing is getting underway early.

The streaking St. Louis Blues, flailing Los Angeles Kings, Kraken and Nashville Predators are competing for two wild-card spots.\n\nSeattle's Oliver Bjorkstrand said he and his teammates need to \u201cwork our butts off\" to qualify.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re in the hunt for it,\u201d Bjorkstrand said. \u201cThere\u2019s other teams playing good hockey, so, yeah, we got to win games.\u201d\n\nMVP REPEAT?\n\nMcDavid and the Edmonton Oilers have won 16 in a row, one shy of the record, and the reigning Hart Trophy winner is making a case to be MVP for the fourth time in his nine-year career. He trails MacKinnon by 17 points and Tampa Bay's Nikita Kucherov by 18 in the scoring race, but McDavid is arguably playing better all-around hockey than he did last season.\n\n\u201cIt might not be the most offensively sexy year, but I think we\u2019re doing a lot of good things,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cI feel good about my game. I feel good about where I\u2019m at, and I feel good about our group.\u201d\n\nMacKinnon and Colorado won the Stanley Cup in 2022, sweeping Edmonton in the West final, but he has yet to be voted MVP.\n\nMcDavid would trade that hardware to lift the Cup over his head for the first time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about winning, and that's kind of all it is,\" McDavid said.\n\n___"}

(AP) \u2014 Steve Wilks has had a roller coaster ride in his first season as defensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nFaced with a tricky task of taking over a successful defense that still had the same position coaches and system of his predecessor DeMeco Ryans, Wilks tried to add his own twists without ruining what had worked so well in the past.\n\nThere were good moments such as a dominating five-game start to the season and bad ones such as a three-game losing streak in October that led to Wilks moving from the coaching booth to the sideline.\n\nBut the season will end with Wilks calling plays in the Super Bowl with the task of slowing down Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nDespite reaching the Super Bowl stage, Wilks' unit is still under fire after two lackluster performances in the playoffs, including allowing 182 yards rushing in the NFC title game win against Detroit that featured a handful of plays, including a 15-yard run by Jahmyr Gibbs, where some players were seen giving less than maximum effort.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\n\u201cI can tell you as a defense it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Wilks said. \"We\u2019ve got to make sure that we play every down as if it\u2019s going to be the difference in the ballgame. You could see on those particular plays, it wasn\u2019t to our standard. Those guys understand and know that and quite honestly it was embarrassing.\u201d\n\nThose thoughts were echoed all week by coach Kyle Shanahan, general manager John Lynch and defensive players such as 2022 AP Defensive Player of the Year Nick Bosa and All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner.\n\n\u201cNot good enough. Not good enough at all,\u201d Warner said. \u201cThe standard has been what it has been for as long as I\u2019ve been here. We rely heavily on winning games heavily on defense, holding teams to minimal points, suffocating teams, dictating how the game\u2019s going to go based off how we go. That hasn\u2019t been the case last few games.\"\n\nThe Niners led the NFL in points allowed (16.3 per game), yards allowed (300.6 per game) and were tied for second in takeaways (30) last season under Ryans, going all the way to the NFC title game for the second straight season.\n\nThe numbers this season dropped off only marginally with the 49ers allowing 1.2 more points per game, 3.3 more yards per game and generating two fewer takeaways.\n\n\u201cIt was stressful in the beginning of the year,\u201d Bosa said. \u201cIt seemed like everybody was coming after him. I kind of felt for him because it\u2019s not one guy\u2019s fault ever in football.\u201d\n\nA win in the Super Bowl would be a measure of validation for Wilks, who was passed over a little more than a year ago for the head coaching job in Carolina despite a 6-6 run as interim coach.\n\nWilks then joined the Niners staff, while the Panthers had a 2-15 season and fired coach Frank Reich after 11 games.\n\nWilks is now headed to his third Super Bowl as an assistant coach, having lost previous trips in the 2006 season with Chicago and the 2015 season with Carolina when he was a defensive backs coach.\n\nWhile Wilks is focused on the task at hand, he did take time to send out a message on social media after the Niners won the NFC title game.\n\n\u201cAs I look back on my life, I realize that every time I thought I was being REJECTED from something good, I was actually being re-directed to something better,\u201d Wilks wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nWilks, who said before the season that he preferred calling games from the box above the field, was moved down to the sideline in November to improve the communication following a mid-season slide that featured poor tackling and energy from his unit.\n\nImprovement on the field followed with Warner saying it was beneficial to be able to look his play-caller in the eyes when they figured out needed adjustments to make during a game.\n\nLynch said that paid off with the improved performance in the second halves of the two playoff wins.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got this commanding presence,\u201d Lynch said. \"I think the move down to the field because of that was a good one. I think the ability to adjust within a game, I feel strongly it\u2019s easier when you have a guy down. ... We saw fit to make that change. I think it\u2019s been a good one. We\u2019re very grateful to what Steve\u2019s given to us, excited to have him going into this last game. We are where we\u2019re at and there\u2019s a lot of reasons for it. He\u2019s one of them.\"\n\n___"}

The film, directed by Matthew Vaughn, managed to lead the weekend box office, but still found little interest from moviegoers.\n\nAlthough Apple has been in the original film business since 2019 and won the Oscar for best picture with 2021's \u201cCODA,\u201d the company has only recently produced its own lineup of big-budget releases.

But both films raised Apple's reputation as a home to top directors and prestige filmmaking.\n\nThe same can't be said for \u201cArgylle,\u201d a twisty thriller starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell and Henry Cavill. The movie was badly dinged by critics, who gave it a Rotten Tomatoes score of 35% \u201cfresh.\u201d Ticket buyers also gave it a thumbs down, with a C+ CinemaScore.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nApple has paired with traditional studios for each of those releases.

But one of its biggest talking points ahead of its release was conjecture that Taylor Swift might have been involved with the movie thanks to the prominent presence of argyle patterns and a cat in the promotional materials. Despite plenty of online discussion, Swift had no involvement in the film.\n\nSecond place on the weekend went to the Christian drama series \u201cThe Chosen.\u201d The first three episodes of the fourth season of the series, which dramatizes the life of Jesus, played in 2,263 theaters. The Angel Studios release grossed $6 million Friday through Sunday.\n\nOn another quiet weekend in cinemas, the rest of ticket sales went mainly to holdovers and awards contenders.\n\nWarner Bros.' \u201cWonka,\" in its eighth week, crossed $200 million domestically. After four weeks in theaters, Paramount's \u201cMean Girls\u201d crossed $100 million. \u201cThe Beekeeper,\" from the Amazon MGM, neared $50 million in its fourth week.\n\nAlthough many Oscar contenders hit theaters months ago, the top choices of those in theaters remain Cord Jefferson's \u201cAmerican Fiction\u201d ($15 million thus far for MGM), starring Jeffrey Wright, and Yorgos Lanthimos' \u201cPoor Things\u201d ($28.2 million, plus $40.1 million overseas), starring Emma Stone.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.

Trump had mistakenly asserted that Haley was in charge of security at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the building.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police are responsible for security on the grounds of the Capitol and protecting Congress, along with the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms.

Prosecutors alleged that a dispute over a marijuana sale escalated when Atkins threatened to kill Hibbs and blow up her house. Atkins was arrested in the case in May 2022.\n\nDefense attorney Craig Penglase argued that the case was built on a \u201cmountain of doubt\u201d following pressure from Hibbs' family and media reports on the case.

Chuck Schumer, and top Republican, Sen. Mitch McConnell. The Senate was expected this week to hold a key test vote on the legislation, but it has already run into a wall of opposition from conservatives.\n\nWith Congress stalled on approving tens of billions of dollars in Ukraine aid, the U.S. has halted shipments of ammunition and missiles to Kyiv, leaving Ukrainian soldiers outgunned as they try to beat back Russia's invasion.\n\nIn a bid to overcome opposition from House Republicans, McConnell had insisted last year that border policy changes be included in the national security funding package. The bill would overhaul the asylum system at the border with faster and tougher enforcement, as well as give presidents new powers to immediately expel migrants if authorities become overwhelmed with the number of people applying for asylum.\n\nHowever, in an election-year shift on immigration, Biden and many Democrats have embraced the idea of strict border enforcement, while Donald Trump and his allies have both criticized the proposed measures as insufficient. They have also argued that presidents already have enough authority to curb illegal border crossings \u2014 a stance that would ensure immigration remains a major issue in the presidential election.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nJohnson, a Republican of Louisiana, in an interview Sunday on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d said he was unaware of the bill's details, but pointed to a House proposal of hardline immigration measures.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is you have to stem the flow,\u201d Johnson said. He also made it clear that he \u2014 not Trump \u2014 would decide whether to bring the bill to the floor if it passes the Senate. But in a further sign that Johnson is resistant to the Senate package, he indicated Saturday that the House will vote on a separate package of $17.6 billion of military aid for Israel \u2014 a move that allows House Republicans to show support for Israel apart from the Senate deal.\n\n\u201cI feel confident that when our bill passes the Senate and gets to the House, members of the House, including Speaker Johnson, will have had ample opportunity to read, understand the bill and ask questions,\" said Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona independent who negotiated the border proposal, on CBS' \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nThe border proposal, which took months to negotiate, is aimed at gaining control of an asylum system that has been overwhelmed by historic numbers of migrants coming to the border. The bill proposes an overhaul to the system with tougher and quicker enforcement measures. If the number of illegal border crossings reaches above 5,000 daily for a five-day average, an expulsion authority would automatically kick in so that migrants are sent back to Mexico without an opportunity to make an asylum claim. If the number reaches 4,000, presidential administrations would have the option of using the expulsion authority.\n\nBiden, referencing the authority, has said he would use it to \u201cshut down the border\u201d as soon as the bill is signed into law.\n\nThe bill would allot $18.5 billion to immigration enforcement, including the hiring of thousands of new officers to evaluate asylum claims, as well as hundreds of Border Patrol agents, according to a person briefed on the package who spoke anonymously to discuss the bill. $1.4 billion of that would go to shelters and services in cities across the U.S. that have struggled to keep up with the influx of migrants in recent months.\n\nMigrants who seek asylum, which provides protection for people facing persecution in their home countries, would face a tougher and faster process to having their claim evaluated. The standard in initial interviews, known as credible fear screenings, would be raised, and many would receive those interviews within days of arriving at the border. Final decisions on their asylum claims would happen within months, rather than the often years-long wait that happens now.\n\nAmong Democrats, the tougher asylum standards have raised concern, especially from progressive and Hispanic lawmakers. While the wings of both parties have been openly critical of the policies under discussion, many have withheld final judgment until they can review the text of the bill, which has been a closely guarded secret in the Capitol.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries suggested in an interview on ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d that he would be supportive if it gets to the House.\n\n\"It should not be dead on arrival,\" he said. \u201cWe need more common sense in Washington, D.C., less conflict and less chaos. We\u2019re in a period of divided government. That means we should be trying to find bipartisan common ground.\u201d\n\nSenators finalized the border proposal on Friday, but other portions of the package, including aid for U.S. allies, investments in defense manufacturing capabilities and humanitarian assistance for people caught up in conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, were still being negotiated by Senate appropriators."}

Mikel Arteta and his players knew that this was all but a must-win showpiece and they would find a way to prevail, to clamber into second place and slash Liverpool\u2019s lead at the top to a couple of points. Manchester City, who play at Brentford on Monday night, remain within striking distance of the summit. We have the prospect of a three-way shootout for the trophy.\n\nArsenal deserved to win on the balance of a frenetic game, mainly because of the way that they controlled the first half. But the manner of how they got themselves in front \u2013 decisively so \u2013 came as the surprise. Then again, it was that kind of wild afternoon, the kind to burn out managers.\n\nWe had already seen William Saliba, one of the division\u2019s most reliable centre-halves, get himself into a terrible mix-up with his goalkeeper, David Raya, leading to the Liverpool equaliser \u2013 a Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es own goal, forced by Luis D\u00edaz. But now we had the same scenario play out at the other end to cut through the feeling that Liverpool were building up a head of steam.\n\nIt was midway through the second half and it was Virgil van Dijk who suffered a breakdown with his goalkeeper, Alisson, wanting him to deal with a high ball forward under pressure from Gabriel Martinelli and watching him completely miss his kick. Martinelli rolled into the empty net and Arsenal were on their way.\n\nLiverpool had barely missed a beat since the 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Anfield on 23 December, roaring forward on all four fronts. But their second defeat of the league season was in the post, confirmed when the Arsenal substitute, Leandro Trossard, stormed through in stoppage-time to embarrass Alisson. Trossard\u2019s low shot took a slight deflection off Van Dijk before going through Alisson\u2019s legs.\n\nBy then, Liverpool had been reduced to 10 men, Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 collecting a second yellow card on 88 minutes for a check on Kai Havertz. J\u00fcrgen Klopp had thrown everything he had at Arsenal. Now there was nothing left.\n\nThe biggest game of the season had needed no buildup, although it got it all the same and there was a reminder of what it was about before kick-off \u2013 a replica of the Premier League trophy, decked out in sky blue and white ribbons, on the desk of the host broadcaster by the side of the pitch.\n\nThe jeopardy was greater for Arsenal, who had won only two of the previous 17 league meetings with Liverpool, and they had to contend with the loss of Gabriel Jesus, the striker having felt his niggly knee injury at the worst moment. Then again, Klopp could only name Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez among the substitutes while Dominik Szoboszlai was injured again. Conor Bradley did not travel in the wake of the devastation of his father\u2019s death on Saturday.\n\nArsenal brought the intensity at the outset and the home support responded; the Emirates was jumping. Arteta had clearly demanded a fast start and there was a moment on seven minutes when he retrieved the ball for an Arsenal throw-in with a near-maniacal sense of purpose.\n\nView image in fullscreen Bukayo Saka celebrates his goal with Martin \u00d8degaard.

From a Raya throw, Martinelli switched on the after-burners to glide away from Konat\u00e9 before crossing for Bukayo Saka, who had timed his run. Saka\u2019s headed connection was not true.\n\nArteta had started Havertz up front, with Martin \u00d8degaard in the No 10 role and it was the latter who ignited the move for the opening goal. The Arsenal captain sniffed out space between the lines and he played a lovely first-time pass that released Havertz, who was one-on-one with Alisson. He had to score and yet Alisson blocked. Sadly for the Liverpool goalkeeper, the rebound fell nicely for Saka, who banged home his 11th goal of the season.\n\nArsenal dominated the first half. They won the physical duels \u2013 there were times when it felt as though Declan Rice was everywhere \u2013 and there were plenty of examples of them showing their personality on the ball, not least Ben White. \u00d8degaard had a shot blocked by Van Dijk after Liverpool had been robbed when trying to play out; Gabriel and Martinelli also had half-chances.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They had done next to nothing as an attacking force in the first half but they always give the impression that they know their moment will come.\n\nIt did on the stroke of half-time. From an Arsenal point of view, the concession was a disaster, Saliba trying to shepherd a Ryan Gravenberch ball over the top back to Raya. D\u00edaz nipped in to force it across where it hit Gabriel\u2019s hand and went in. The breakdown betweeen Saliba and Raya was total. Saliba had to take greater control of the situation.\n\nQuick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

The Emirates became a more angsty place, with Curtis Jones shaping a curler just past the far post. For Arsenal, \u00d8degaard watched a shot deflect wide. Klopp made a move before the hour, introducing N\u00fa\u00f1ez up front; Harvey Elliott at right midfield; Andy Robertson at left-back. D\u00edaz banged a shot too close to Raya.\n\nArsenal, though, went deep into the depths of their resolve. They badly needed something and, after Havertz had screamed in vain for a penalty after a tangle with Alexis Mac Allister, they got it with the Martinelli goal.\n\nThe closing stages were chaotic. Mac Allister shot inches wide following a corner while the Arsenal substitute, Jakub Kiwior, headed at Alisson when he should have scored. Klopp shifted D\u00edaz to right-back and went for broke with Diogo Jota and N\u00fa\u00f1ez as twin strikers. Arsenal stood tall."}

The authorities believe the real number is probably 10 times that, while Russian officials have even boasted of moving 700,000 Ukrainian children to Russia.\n\nNearly two years into the war, there are growing fears that if no way is found to bring the children home soon, Russia\u2019s systemic programme to \u201cre-educate\u201d Ukrainian children could prove devastatingly effective. Ukrainian officials are calling on international organisations and neutral countries who may still hold some sway in Moscow to put pressure on Russia.\n\nOf the 19,500 cases for which Ukrainian authorities have names and data, only about 400, including Veronika, have managed to return to Ukraine so far.\n\n\u201cRussia is actively erasing their Ukrainian identity and inflicting unbelievable emotional and psychological damage,\u201d said Latvia\u2019s president, Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds, at a conference devoted to raising awareness of the issue in Riga on Thursday. \u201cWhat makes it even worse is that Russia proudly exhibits its actions,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia\u2019s claims about the resettlement of children are one of the reasons why the issue formed the basis of the arrest warrant issued by the international criminal court last year for Vladimir Putin and for the Russian children\u2019s commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova. The warrant says Russia acted with the \u201cintention to permanently remove\u201d children from Ukraine, a war crime.\n\nAndriy Kostin, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, said Russia\u2019s actions were the largest-scale deportation of children in Europe since the second world war. \u201cRussia is trying to destroy the Ukrainian nation, not only physically, but by severing familial bonds and erasing the Ukrainian identity of the deported children,\u201d he said in Riga.\n\nRussia has used different methods to bring Ukrainian children to Russia or Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, often citing security concerns and a need to remove children from dangerous areas of conflict. In some cases, Russian authorities moved entire orphanages or children\u2019s homes to Russian-controlled areas. In other cases, children were separated from their parents, taken to Russia and given new names.\n\nView image in fullscreen Olena Zelenska, Ukraine\u2019s first lady, said of the missing children: \u2018Russia is telling them they are not wanted, that nobody is looking for them.\u2019 Photograph: Julien de Rosa/EPA\n\nIn November a BBC investigation uncovered that an infant girl stolen from a children\u2019s home in occupied Kherson had been transferred to Moscow, issued with new documents with a changed name claiming she was born in Russia, then adopted by a Russian political leader and Putin ally, Sergei Mironov.\n\nNot all of the children were taken forcibly to Russia. Veronika, who grew up in a village in the Kharkiv region less than a mile from the border, travelled across the border with her aunt two weeks after Russia launched its full-scale invasion, to avoid the military clashes that were tearing through her village as the Russian army advanced.\n\nShe and her aunt stayed in a series of camps for refugees. Veronika, then 12, was initially pleased to be in Russia, the first time she had set foot in the country. It was the first time for two weeks that she could wash and have hot food and a comfortable place to sleep without the sound of explosions.\n\nVeronika was eventually separated from her aunt and placed in a children\u2019s home in the city of Lipetsk. Her mother, who formerly served in the Ukrainian army, was unable to travel to Russia to search for Veronika for fear of arrest.\n\n\u201cIt was so hard to be alone in this environment, with everyone telling me terrible things about Ukraine,\u201d Veronika said. After a while she was so traumatised that she lost a lot of weight and her hair started falling out.\n\nVeronika\u2019s grandmother travelled thousands of miles on a circuitous route from Kharkiv to Lipetsk via Poland and the Baltic states to rescue her granddaughter and bring her back to Ukraine, where she has been reunited with her mother.\n\n\u201cNow I just want to help other Ukrainian children to come home too,\u201d Veronika said.\n\nRussian authorities have claimed that Ukrainian children whose parents or guardians travel to Russia are able to take them home, and in some cases, such as Veronika\u2019s, this has eventually worked. But not every child has a relative who is able to make the long and risky journey, not every child is able to contact their families, and there are many cases of younger children having their names changed before adoption by Russian families.\n\n\u201cRussia is telling them they are not wanted, that nobody is looking for them, changing their names and trying to issue them Russian passports,\u201d said Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine\u2019s president, who was in Riga last week to speak on the issue.\n\nShe called on allies of Ukraine and neutral countries to work as intermediaries to help bring Ukraine\u2019s children home. She cited the case of one child who had been returned after efforts from the UN agency Unicef and Qatar. \u201cThere is no more important task for the adults to use their power and resources on than to help rescue children,\u201d she said."}

There are serious questions to answer.\u201d\n\nThe controversy is the latest in a series relating to his wife and Infosys to engulf Sunak. In 2022, when Sunak was chancellor, Murty agreed to pay UK tax on all her overseas income, but not on backdated income, after a row about her non-dom tax status. As a non-domiciled UK resident, she is not required by law to pay UK taxes on her overseas income.\n\nThe same year, Sunak faced accusations that Murty was collecting \u201cblood money\u201d in dividends because Infosys was still operating in Russia despite Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Sunak calling for companies to pull out. The firm later said it was urgently closing its Moscow office.\n\nLast month, Murty donated her shares in the childcare company Koru Kids to charity, following concerns about whether she stood to benefit from government policies.\n\nShe took the decision after parliament\u2019s standards watchdog concluded last year that the prime minister inadvertently breached parliament\u2019s code of conduct by failing to properly declare his wife\u2019s shareholding, which stood to benefit from a government childcare policy announced in the spring budget.\n\nConcerns have also been raised that Sunak\u2019s family could stand to benefit financially from a post-Brexit free trade agreement (FTA) that he is negotiating with India, raising a conflict of interest. Infosys is known to want to improve access for its many thousands of contract workers through changes to the UK visa regime.\n\nThe briefing paper for the April meeting said one of the objectives was to \u201creassure that the FTA will further create new opportunities and investor-friendly policies to support business growth\u201d.\n\nJohnson outlined to the Infosys executives, whose names were redacted, advantages that could accrue to it through the existing high-potential individual visa scheme.\n\nA DBT spokesperson said: \u201cThe investment minister regularly meets businesses and international investors, including a range of Indian businesses, to champion the UK as an investment destination and secure commitments worth billions of pounds.\n\n\u201cThat engagement drives investment across the UK, creating thousands of high-quality jobs and boosting the UK economy.\u201d\n\nInfosys was approached for comment."}

Research shows it poses a threat to rivals Boots and Superdrug.\n\nFeaturing loud music, beauty treatments and staff waving lip gloss wands, Sephora\u2019s stores aim to be fun to visit. The beauty industry turns on a hunger for newness from consumers \u201cwho have 10 to 20 lipsticks they don\u2019t necessarily use but they\u2019ve just wanted to try\u201d, says Sara Hudson, a partner the consulting firm McKinsey. \u201cMulti-brand stores drive a lot of that discovery, so we often call it a candy shop for adults.\u201d\n\nOpening stores is a way of raising the brand\u2019s profile and showcasing the latest brands, but market data shows the internet is now the most important beauty sales channel, ringing up \u00a32bn of the \u00a39.3bn Britons spent on themselves last year, according to McKinsey.\n\nAhead of its UK entry, Sephora bought the British beauty website Feelunique for \u00a3132m. It has since been subsumed into the Sephora website, which Boyd says is going from \u201cstrength to strength\u201d.\n\nIn a world where browsing happens on phones rather than in beauty halls, Silverman says Sephora is better than rivals at engaging with customers online: \u201cTheir social media and customer service are so tightly integrated, it feels like the brand is part of a customer\u2019s personal network rather than just a store.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say Sephora\u2019s work with up-and-coming brands and collaborations with high-profile influencers on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube has helped the brand reach its target female audience of 24-36-year-olds. (Although the worrying flipside of this is that children as young as 10 are putting pressure on their parents to buy them expensive anti-ageing brands after seeing them on their social media feeds).\n\nAnother part of the appeal is that Sephora is giving UK shoppers access to brands, such as Tarte cosmetics and Skinfix, that could not previously be bought in Britain. This meant buying from abroad and paying shipping fees, explains Tash Van Boxel, analyst at GlobalData. Now shoppers can \u201cbypass these added costs to access brands and products that are trending online\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis ensures appeal, particularly among younger shoppers.\u201d"}

The Wales and Lions fly-half has died at the age of 79 a month after the passing of another Welsh legend, JPR Williams, and there is extra poignancy in that John\u2019s departure came hours after one of the great Welsh comebacks in their 27-26 Six Nations opening defeat against Scotland in Cardiff on Saturday.\n\nA statement released by John\u2019s family on Sunday read: \u201cBarry John died peacefully today at the University Hospital of Wales surrounded by his loving wife and four children. He was a loving Dadcu [grandfather] to his 11 grandchildren and a much-loved brother.\u201d\n\nWales\u2019s fly-half factory has churned out some de-luxe products over the years and there will always be bar-room arguments over who was the greatest. Cliff Morgan and David Watkins had their advocates, as did the brilliant Phil Bennett, who succeeded John in the No10 shirt. More recently, Jonathan Davies and the points-machine Stephen Jones joined the stockpile of talent. But they would have all agreed that John was in a league of his own. After all when you have been hailed as \u201cThe King\u201d and by a bunch of hard-nosed journalists in New Zealand you probably have the claim to be the best of the bunch.\n\nBarry John had been the star turn on the victorious Lions tour of New Zealand in 1971. John had been on a losing Lions tour in 1968 but, despite the wretched weather in New Zealand, he left would-be tacklers groping at thin air. This was John at his zenith. He scored 188 points on the tour and it wasn\u2019t just his elusive running that had the locals doffing their caps. John\u2019s accurate goal-kicking and tactical awareness help sink the All Blacks in the mud.\n\nBut in the blink of an eye John was gone. Wales were denied a grand slam the following year because of the Troubles in Ireland and John called it a day at the age of 27. He had been compared to George Best and was mobbed and feted in his own country. But rugby union was an amateur game and John was a modest man. He found the attention stifling, the end coming when he visited a bank and a cashier curtseyed. Bennett, a prince of fly-halves in his own right, took over Wales\u2019s No 10 shirt and a golden era of Welsh rugby began.\n\nJohn learned the art of fly-half play at the feet of another Welsh great Carwyn James at Llanelli and he briefly displaced David Watkins in the Welsh side in 1966. The position became his when Watkins turned professional in the autumn of 1967 and John made such an impression that he was picked for the Lions the following year. But on the heavy ground in South Africa the young man broke his collar-bone in a heavy tackle in the first Test in Pretoria and played no further part on the tour. John\u2019s determination to succeed in 1971 stemmed from that disappointment in South Africa and although the powerful All Blacks pack had the better of the Lions up-front the visitors\u2019 backs in which John formed an unshakeable bond with Gareth Edwards, his half-back partner, were unstoppable.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Breakdown Free weekly newsletter The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: PA\n\nFor, although John is best remembered as a classic running fly-half he was, like JPR Williams, no stranger to the physical side of rugby. In the Welsh grand slam win of 1971 he showed his character with a brave tackle on France\u2019s hard man forward Benoit Dauga in which he broke his nose.\n\nThere was no way back for John after he left the game in 1972. By that time he had professionalised himself by writing an autobiography and becoming a newspaper columnist and, like Best, he often felt uncomfortable with fame. And like Best, John did have a wayward side to his character and often enjoyed a drop too much of the hard stuff.\n\nRIP Barry \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4fanother one of my heroes sadly gone. #BarryJohnTheKing pic.twitter.com/HOD9S0ZsYq \u2014 Jonathan Davies OBE (@JiffyRugby) February 4, 2024\n\nGareth Edwards admitted that part of himself was lost the day his partner called it a day. \u201cIt is fair to say that after years of rooming together for Cardiff, Wales and the Lions that I knew Barry as well as anybody. When he broke his collar-bone in South Africa I was the one buttoning his shirts and helping to put his trousers on him. Barry was such a contrast to me as a personality. Before matches I was full of nervous energy. He took everything calmly and in his stride but once he stepped out beyond that white line the man was immense.\u201d\n\nJohn may only have played 25 times for Wales and in five Tests for the Lions but his legacy was forged more than half a century ago. Jonathan Davies, one of the most renowned Welsh players of the 1980s and 1990s, paid tribute to John, writing on X: \u201cRIP Barry - another one of my heroes sadly gone\u201d. The Welsh Rugby Union president Terry Cobner, who played in the Wales back row and toured with the Lions in 1977 said that Barry John was \u201cprobably the greatest fly-half of all time\u201d. Cobner added: \u201cComing on top of the recent deaths of Brian Price and JPR, this is another huge blow for Welsh rugby.\u201d"}

Built at a cost of \u00a31bn, everything about Chelsea was weak and pathetic. It is no exaggeration to say they look broken under the \u00adownership of Todd Boehly and \u00adClearlake Capital.\n\nStamford Bridge was an anxious, irritable place throughout. Wolves sensed the nerves and \u00adimmediately pressed. Cunha and Neto had chances to test Djordje Petrovic, Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper, after Caicedo twice lost possession during the opening moments.\n\nChelsea responded with sporadic bursts. They threatened when Chilwell released Christopher Nkunku, who was denied by Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1\u2019s brave goalkeeping and Dawson\u2019s alert defending, but there was little flow to their play. Even the good bits were improvised. There was nothing resembling an actual identity. Even the opening goal came out of the blue, Conor Gallagher quickening the pace and combining with Caicedo, whose pass evaded Toti Gomes and arrived at a pace that allowed Cole Palmer to beat S\u00e1 with an instant right-footed finish.\n\nView image in fullscreen Chelsea defender Thiago Silva reacts after missing a chance to score. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGoing behind changed nothing for Wolves. They pressed again two minutes later, Jo\u00e3o Gomes picking Caicedo\u2019s pocket and feeding Cunha. The Brazilian ran at Axel Disasi, cut inside from the left and equalised with a shot that deflected in off Silva.\n\nThe goal sapped Chelsea\u2019s belief. Gallagher, Caicedo and Enzo \u00adFern\u00e1ndez grew ragged in midfield. Nkunku looked lost up front. Malo Gusto almost lost A\u00eft-Nouri. Mario Lemina headed over. Silva made an important block on Neto.\n\nWolves, who replaced Chelsea in 10th, kept releasing Neto by knocking passes behind Chilwell on their right. Chelsea were a mess. Nobody put any pressure on the ball and nobody covered Chilwell. Wolves duly took advantage when N\u00e9lson Semedo found Neto, who pulled the back for A\u00eft-Nouri to score thanks to a deflection off Disasi.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While Raheem Sterling should have equalised, only to fire wide after outstanding work from Chilwell and Palmer, Wolves almost extended their lead when Neto raced through and forced Petrovic to save. Pablo Sarabia bent a free-kick inches wide.\n\nQuick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

It was the most aggression anyone in blue had shown all afternoon. Meanwhile, Neto was soon tearing down the right, easily outpacing Silva, and teeing up Cunha to slam a gleeful shot past Petrovic from close range.\n\nThe mood turned ugly. Sarabia missed a chance to make it 4-1 and Jackson fluffed a header at the other end. Enraged, the Chelsea fans began to chant for Roman Abramovich. Unfortunately, the club\u2019s former owner had not made the squad. Instead, Pochettino brought on Carney Chukwuemeka and Mykhailo Mudryk for Nkunku and Sterling, who walked off to loud jeers.\n\nIt made no difference. There was time for Gusto to lose Cunha and \u00adconcede a penalty with a ridiculous challenge. The anger grew when Cunha sent Petrovic the wrong way from the spot. It briefly subsided when Silva\u2019s header made it 4-2 but even 10 minutes of added time were not enough to deny Wolves their first double over Chelsea since 1975."}

As has long been the case with Anderson, writing him off is a mug\u2019s game.\n\nThe same probably goes for England overall, their time under Stokes and the head coach, Brendon McCullum, featuring five successful chases of more than 250, including the memorable 378 for three they knocked off against India at Edgbaston in 2022.\n\nSpeaking at the close, with England 67 for one chasing 399 after claiming the final six Indian wickets for just 44 runs, Anderson said: \u201cI think the nerves were there to see today, the way they batted. I think they didn\u2019t know how many was enough. I don\u2019t know if intimidating is the right word, but [our approach] is putting different thoughts in oppositions\u2019 minds.\n\n\u201cIndia were quite cautious, even when they had a big lead. The chat last night from the coach [McCullum] was that if they get 600, we were going to go for it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been moments throughout the last two years, particularly in the last 12 months, that makes us think we\u2019re doing something well because the way teams have reacted. Going back to the first ball of the Ashes having point on the boundary sends a message to us we\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\n\nAnderson clearly was doing something right himself on the third morning, his quickfire removals of Rohit Sharma, bowled by a ball for the best-of album, and Yashasvi Jaiswal, edged to slip, setting the tone. He induced an injury concern for England during this sublime spell, however, Joe Root exacerbating a blow to his right little finger during the warm-ups when an edge dropped just short of him at first slip.\n\n\u201cHis finger is not great,\u201d Anderson said, after Root spent much of the day off the field having it iced. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s [serious] concerns. It was a case of making sure he\u2019s as good as he can be. There was no point risking it. There\u2019s a chance we will need him with the bat.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen England's Joe Root falls after colliding with India's Yashasvi Jaiswal on Sunday. Photograph: Manish Swarup/AP\n\nAsked about his own performance, five wickets across the two innings matching his entire return from the Ashes, Anderson replied: \u201cAs a player you want to contribute to the team and this summer I didn\u2019t do that, so I felt disappointed from that point of view. What the time away did do, it gave me a chance to think about what I can improve on. It also gave me time to work on my fitness, knowing that coming to India, it\u2019s a hard place as a seamer.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week\u2019s action Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I felt strong doing it as well. All that work I was doing in the last few months has really paid off and that\u2019s probably the most satisfying thing for me.\u201d\n\nAs father of the house, Anderson was also proud to watch Rehan Ahmed and Tom Hartley share seven wickets on the day, plus Shoaib Bashir, on debut, claiming the key pelt of the centurion Shubman Gill. \u201cThey kept coming and coming and didn\u2019t give up at any stage, even when Shubman was playing really well,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe way they stuck at it, the calmness they showed was outstanding for young lads.\u201d"}

On his 21st birthday, H\u00f8jlund greeted his finish with a hopping air-guitar mime and a raucous cheer was provoked when, after Garnacho doubled the lead, Diogo Dalot skidded along the grass to block Jarrod Bowen\u2019s shot.\n\nThe low note was the sight of Lisandro Mart\u00ednez, four games into returning from a foot injury, being forced off on 71 minutes with what appeared to be a knee problem. The Argentinian had played on after the clash with Tomas Soucek that seemed to cause the injury.\n\nTen Hag said: \u201cIt is a personal disaster [for him]. It seems bad. We have to wait, make the right \u00addiagnosis in the coming days and we will see. Hopefully it is not too bad, we can only pray.\u201d\n\nVictory lifts United into sixth, eight points behind Aston Villa in fourth. Ten Hag said: \u201cWe can achieve a lot because everyone is killing everyone [in the league]. The three youngsters celebrating together \u2013 before the season we saw the potential but they need games, experience.\u201d\n\nEven at 2-0 up United were too open until Garnacho\u2019s second sealed victory and claimed two consecutive Premier League wins for only a third time this season.\n\nWest Ham had preyed on this shakiness early on by strolling about and nearly profiting from their first corner. James Ward-Prowse lifted the ball in, Soucek\u2019s header was flicked on by Edson \u00c1lvarez before Andr\u00e9 Onana, nose-to-nose with him in a crammed six-yard box, dived left to save.\n\nUnited upped gear. Harry \u00adMaguire, in for Rapha\u00ebl Varane, intercepted Soucek\u2019s pass near halfway. \u00adMarcus Rashford took over and drove through the area before Kurt Zouma cleared. The corner, taken short by a combination of Luke Shaw and Marcus Rashford, was worked to Bruno Fernandes: he thumped a shot, it dipped under the bar, and Alphonse Areola palmed away.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rasmus H\u00f8jlund gives Manchester United the lead. Photograph: Alan Martin/Colorsport/Shutterstock\n\nNext, Soucek\u2019s 20-yard effort went for a corner and when the ball broke to Mohammed Kudus, Mart\u00ednez fouled the winger.\n\nWard-Prowse smashed the free\u2011kick low and Casemiro repelled the strike with his head.\n\nThe Brazilian was then pivotal in H\u00f8jlund\u2019s fifth strike in six outings as he stabbed a Zouma clearance to the Dane. In a flash H\u00f8jlund dropped a shoulder, shifted the ball from his left to right, and a dead-eye finish beat Areola. The rest of the half featured \u00adUnited\u2019s tempo slowing and the Hammers threatening them at several Ward-Prowse set pieces. From one corner H\u00f8jlund nearly turned culprit by grappling Zouma in the area. He escaped sanction and, as the interval neared, missed a Garnacho tee-up, spraying wide from an acute angle.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ten Hag\u2019s men emerged \u00adneeding to be quicker, and slicker \u2013 which Maguire was not when dawdling and Emerson Palmieri mugged him. Suddenly the left-back was in but he scooped over and, instantly, regretted his miss, as West Ham conceded.\n\nIt was simple: Fernandes floated the ball right to Garnacho who chopped on to his left and unloaded, the shot ricocheting off Nayef Aguerd beyond Fabianski. The \u00adGarnacho\u2011H\u00f8jlund-Mainoo cele\u00adbration followed and United had a two\u2011goal lead. It should have been 3-0 when the ball bobbled to Rashford but he skied the attempt, \u00adshowing a rare smile which, given his recent \u00adBelfast\u2011located travails, was \u00adheartening to see.\n\nQuick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

Scott \u00adMcTominay, on for Mainoo, stripped Kalvin Phillips of possession and curved the ball right to Garnacho, who trotted forward and made no mistake.\n\nDavid Moyes said: \u201cWe played better than when we beat them [2-0 at home] in December.

Companies are required to match, or substitute, 4% of their boiler sales with heat pumps or face a fine of \u00a33,000 for every installation they fall short by.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that lobbyists for the gas boiler industry were trying to delay the new measures. Now Claire Coutinho, who became energy secretary in September, is reportedly minded to scrap the target and fines after concluding that it was bad for consumers.\n\n\u201cBoiler manufacturers have saddled families with indefensible price hikes \u2013 this is not right,\u201d a government source told the Sunday Times. \u201cWe\u2019re looking again at the policy, and expect manufacturers to do the right thing and remove their price hikes immediately.\u201d\n\nIn readiness for the new targets, manufacturers started pushing up prices last year. In September, Worcester Bosch, the UK\u2019s biggest manufacturer, told the Times its prices were going up by as much as \u00a3300 because the UK market for heat pumps was not yet at sufficient scale, which meant it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that it would face fines.\n\nA formal decision has not been announced, but according to the report, Coutinho believes ditching the policy may be the only way to get manufacturers to drop their prices again and that the government can still hit its target of 600,000 heat pumps through other schemes and incentives.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to our ambition of installing 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028,\u201d said a Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson when approached for comment.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Training has been really positive this week and that transmitted to the pitch. [Why didn\u2019t the Liverpool goal derail you?] Because we\u2019ve got people like [Jorginho], the skipper, myself; people that drive it on. It was a kick in the teeth to concede but we knew it was such a big 45 minutes our season and we couldn\u2019t allow one goal to affect that. Before I signed for Arsenal, the prospect of playing with [Jorginho] and Partey was a big thing. I\u2019ve played against him and know how he controls games, how calm he is on the ball.

That gave Martinelli an open goal, a gift he accepted with joyous disbelief.\n\nUpdated at 13.56 EST\n\n2h ago 12.57 EST GOAL!

Anthony Taylor says no penalty and the VAR team agree. As Gary Neville says on Sky, Havertz\u2019s loose touch allowed Mac Allister to get between him and the ball. Havertz does so many impressive things, but he\u2019s not a killer.\n\nUpdated at 12.57 EST\n\n2h ago 12.53 EST 62 min \u201cSorry, gotta take issue with Deep Purple\u2019s categorisation,\u201d says Dean Kinsella. \u201cBack in the day they were labelled as a \u2018hard-rock\u2019 band. Not sure heavy metal even existed as a genre in \u201868 (when I first bought a copy of their fantastic \u2018Deep Purple in Rock\u2019 album). The clue is in the name of the album. Oh no! Am I a nerd now?\u201d By the end of this game somebody will be claiming they were on Sarah Records.\n\n\n\n2h ago 12.53 EST 61 min A corner is headed over by Havertz; at the other end, Diaz sweeps a shot straight at Raya from 15 yards. Both were very difficult chances.\n\n\n\n2h ago 12.48 EST 58 min: Triple substitution for Liverpool Andy Robertson, Harvey Elliott and Darwin Nunez come on for Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ryan Gravenberch and Cody Gakpo. That means Joe Gomez will move across to right-back. I guess Alexander-Arnold isn\u2019t yet fit enough to do a full 90 minutes. He hasn\u2019t played well but I doubt Klopp would take him off otherwise.\n\nUpdated at 14.01 EST"}

UK authorities uncovered at least 10 potential threats last year related to kidnapping or harming UK-based individuals perceived as enemies of the Iranian regime.\n\nIt was an \u201cunavoidable fact\u201d that Ireland had \u201cfreeloaded\u201d off the investment of others who were part of Nato, said the report, which added that this \u201chome truth\u201d had been admitted last year by the then taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin, as a discussion about Irish neutrality deepened.\n\nDiscussions about neutrality among Ireland\u2019s political classes have sharpened in the era of Russian aggression under Vladimir Putin, the arrival of Ukrainian refugees, incursions by Russian ships that are suspected of mapping underwater cables, and a 2021 ransomware attack by suspected Russian gangs on the health service.\n\nIreland\u2019s president has rebuked the government for launching a debate about the country\u2019s longstanding military neutrality and the possibility of joining Nato, saying ministers were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d.\n\nThe report tried to sound an alarm bell about the consequences of Sinn F\u00e9in winning Irish elections in 2025.\n\n\u201cIf Sinn F\u00e9in wins in 2025, the UK is therefore looking at many more years of an uncooperative, and likely hostile, neighbour in the face of growing external threats,\u201d it said. While Sinn F\u00e9in had been on the rise in the Republic and now holds the post of first minister in Northern Ireland, it has slumped in polls south of the border.\n\nFallon and Lord Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, welcomed the fact that Ireland had been reviewing its defence outlook \u2013 as Sweden and Finland have also moved away from neutrality \u2013 and called on the UK to encourage its neighbour to strengthen defences and build on a UK-Ireland defence agreement signed in 2015."}

She outlined a \u201chuge landscape\u201d of biases in need of levelling, citing examples ranging from neonatal assessment tools and pulse oximeters that work less well for darker skin tones to heart valves, mesh implants and replacement hip joints that were not designed with female patients in mind.\n\nHughes said: \u201cI don\u2019t see this as blaming individual healthcare professionals \u2013 doctors and nurses \u2013 for getting it wrong. It\u2019s pervasive in the systems we have \u2013 the training, the experience, the resources.\n\n\u201cAnatomy books are very narrow in their focus. Even the resuscitation models are of pale males \u2013 we don\u2019t have female resuscitation models, we don\u2019t have them in darker skin tones. This is deeply ingrained in the way that we assess and listen to patients.\u201d\n\nHughes was appointed in 2022, with a focus on improving the safety of medicines and devices, in response to the Cumberlege review into vaginal mesh, a hormonal pregnancy test, and an anti-epilepsy medicine that harmed unborn babies. The review painted a damning picture in which women\u2019s concerns were consistently dismissed leading to avoidable harm.\n\nHughes said that positive progress is being made in the provision of specialist care for victims of complications from vaginal mesh procedures and welcomed the tightening of prescribing rules for the anti-epilepsy drug, sodium valproate, which came into force in January.\n\nHowever, she said that systemic biases are continuing to negatively affect outcomes for female and ethnic minority patients.\n\nShe described the realisation that pulse oximeters, used to measure blood oxygen levels, work less well for darker skin tones as a \u201creal shock to the system\u201d when the problem was highlighted during the pandemic. More recently, the NHS Race and Health observatory highlighted concerns around neonatal assessments.\n\nBilirubinometers, widely used to assess jaundice in newborn babies, are less reliable for darker skin tones and some guidelines for the assessment of cyanosis (caused by a shortage of blood oxygen) refer to \u201cpink\u201d, \u201cblue\u201d or \u201cpale\u201d skin, without reference to skin changes in minority ethnic babies. The Apgar score, a quick test given to newborns that was rolled out in the 1950s, traditionally includes checking whether a baby is \u201cpink all over\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven the names of those conditions \u2013 jaundice and cyanosis \u2013 suggest a colour. The Apgar score includes P for pink all over,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cThere are systemic biases in that if you have a darker skin tone those conditions may not be so apparent.\u201d\n\nHughes said that the development and testing of devices and medicines needs to cater for a more diverse patient population. Mesh implants, initially used for hernia repairs, were not originally intended for the female pelvis.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt was never designed to be used in the first instance in a woman\u2019s pelvis. It was designed to be used vertically. With the horizontal use, you\u2019ve got movement, weight gain, weight loss, the menstrual cycle \u2013 the physical impact on the mesh itself and the secondary impact on tissues.\u201d\n\nHughes cited evidence that heart valves, most of which have been tested more extensively in male patients, can have less successful outcomes in women, whose hearts are smaller on average. And doctors do not always discuss risks relating to hip joints that specifically affect female patients, she said.\n\n\u201cThere are certain sexual positions that can adversely affect the success of a hip joint, but it\u2019s an awkward conversation \u2026 that orthopaedic surgeons may not particularly want to have,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cIt\u2019s a culture issue.\u201d\n\nMedical textbooks, image libraries and training props also need to be made more diverse, Hughes said, noting that people are less likely to do CPR on women in part because first aid courses typically use male dummies.\n\nShe said: \u201cThey don\u2019t have the experience of working out where to put their hands because the dummies are all men. It impacts on people\u2019s confidence, experience and normalisation.\u201d\n\nBlack babies in England are almost three times more likely to die than white babies, according to figures released last year. The death rate for white infants has remained at about three per 1,000 live births since 2020, but for black and black British babies it has risen from just under six to almost nine per 1,000, according to the National Child Mortality Database.\n\nHughes said that, despite the substantial challenges, there had been positive signs of progress. She said there was a growing move towards publishing demographic data of clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance to be able to assess whether devices are working for all groups equally well. There are also good examples of diversifying design, she said, such as a project at Barts NHS trust to use CT scans of women\u2019s hearts in a virtual design environment for designing heart valves.\n\nProf Habib Naqvi, chief executive of the NHS Race and Health observatory, which reviewed neonatal assessments, said that its recommendations had been taken seriously and steps had been taken to address the concerns, including changes to NHS England guidelines and that overall he is \u201coptimistic\u201d about changes underway.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe disproportionate impact [of Covid-19] on ethnic minority communities and staff has been stark,. During Covid we heard very clearly that we will need to focus on tackling ethnic and racial inequalities in healthcare.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re at that crossroads. We need to make sure that those promises and statements are taken forward.\u201d"}

These tiny pieces of plastic \u2013 the usual definition is anything under 5mm in length \u2013 are a by-product of the over-production of synthetic polymers, and there is increasing evidence that they are infiltrating the entire ecosystem. A recent study found them in 90% of protein types sampled by researchers, while a study from 2020 found them in fruit and vegetables. Another study, published this year suggests that bottled water could contain up to 100 times the amount of plastic particles previously thought, and some studies have even found microplastics in prenatal human placentas. So is this an unstoppable problem? Are there implications for our health that we are only just beginning to see? And if so, is it already too late to do anything about it?\n\nTo start with the bad news: yes, the problem is worse than previously thought. \u201cEveryone knew there were microplastics in our sea water and on our beaches, but we\u2019re now finding them in the freshwater system and as far afield as the Arctic,\u201d says Prof Catherine Wilson, an expert in microplastics at the School of Engineering, Cardiff University. \u201cThis is raising questions about how they are being transported in the air. We\u2019re also seeing \u2013 as we use recycled sludge, a nutrient-rich waste product from sewage treatment, as a fertiliser in agriculture \u2013 that microplastics are being recycled in the environment, which may mean they are building up in the soil on farmland.\u201d\n\nSo how bad are microplastics for humans? There are two clear mechanisms through which microplastics might hurt us: either by chemically disrupting the normal running of our body systems, or by piling up in enough quantities to block our circulatory, respiratory or digestive systems. Increased cancer risk, for instance, is a key concern \u2013 but it\u2019s not clear just how worried we should be. \u201cLinks to the carcinogenic potential of microplastics and nanoplastics, which are barely visible to the eye even under a powerful microscope, has been demonstrated in vitro [laboratory test-tubes or similar] in human cells and in vivo [in a living body] for animal and plant models,\u201d says Prof Jo Cable, head of division at the School of Biosciences, Cardiff University. \u201cBut it\u2019s worth saying that the effects in most of these studies were induced by concentrations of plastic far higher than those detected in the bloodstream in some of the most recent studies.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, it is not clear whether microplastics are having a significant effect on, for example, the production of immune cells or the appetite, although all these possibilities are a concern. \u201cFurther work is needed to determine the effects of this level of exposure \u2013 as well as whether microplastics continue accumulating or are eventually expelled from our bodies,\u201d says Cable. \u201cWe also need to understand whether better alternatives are possible \u2013 for instance, the Plastic Fish project at Cardiff University is investigating whether bio-based plastics and associated additives often marketed as \u2018greener\u2019 than traditional plastics are, in fact, healthier for the environment and organisms if and when exposure occurs. Evidence is mounting that they may not be.\u201d\n\nWhat can we do? Unfortunately, this is a societal problem: the sheer ubiquity of microplastics mean there is little chance of avoiding them. Plastics are an essential and often life-saving commodity, but we\u2019ve been using them unsustainably for years, and left a legacy for future generations that could be difficult to tackle. On a global level, we need to shift towards plastic products that are either biodegradable \u2013 ie break down naturally \u2013 or structurally easier to chemically recycle; and consumers and businesses need to be incentivised to embrace them. It\u2019s not an easy problem to deal with, but as it is likely to affect everyone who swims, eats or breathes, it concerns us all."}

As a high ball began to drop near the touchline Asseyi and Williamson watched it fall and waited. Asseyi was closer and raised her foot but Williamson got there first, showing no fear, powering it forward just before the West Ham striker\u2019s foot connected.\n\nView image in fullscreen Leah Williamson made her first start for Arsenal since her anterior cruciate ligament injury in April 2023. Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty Images\n\nTo study Williamson\u2019s movement and watch her eyes across the course of a match, or the 45 minutes she played here, is to see a reading of the game, a reading of the movement of the ball, an \u00adunderstanding of the spaces that are there or will open up that is magical. Eidevall said: \u201cShe was ready to start a football match. This was a great opportunity for us to do that. She couldn\u2019t play more than a half today, so that was a pre-planned substitution. I think she played very well.\u201d\n\nWilliamson was one of two changes made to the team that defeated Liverpool the previous week, with Catley also starting. Skinner, meanwhile, made one change to the team that beat Bristol City 2-1, with Cissoko forming part of a back three.\n\nArsenal dominated possession, as expected, but they struggled to carve out clear chances against a well\u2011drilled West Ham \u2013 whose defensive performance was epitomised by a stunning last-ditch tackle from Honoka Hayashi to deny Vivianne Miedema who was one-on-one with the goalkeeper, Mackenzie Arnold.\n\nQuick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?
