The 49ers logistics team, including members of the equipment staff and grounds crew, initially raised concerns during a visit last week to UNLV, which was followed by a visit from GM John Lynch. The 49ers had a light walkthrough session on the fields on Monday and will conduct a full practice on Wednesday \u2013 after the team apparently determined there is no feasible alternative.\n\nBy Monday night, the 49ers had essentially squashed the issue. We think.\n\n\"No situation,\" Shanahan declared. \"The players were good with it today and they will be good with it on Wednesday.\"\n\nAlthough NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell downplayed concerns during his news conference on Monday afternoon, maintaining that the fields were \"very playable\" and had passed inspection that meets minimum standards, an alternative plan for the 49ers to practice at the Las Vegas Raiders headquarters \u2013 where the Kansas City Chiefs are practicing \u2013 was floated as a possibility.\n\nGoodell, though, seemed to be having none of that. He vehemently defended the quality of the fields.\n\n\"We've had 23 experts out there,\" Goodell said. \"We've had the union out there. All of them think that's a very playable surface. It's softer than what they have practiced on, but that happens. It's well within all of our testing standards. It is something that we think \u2013 all of our experts, as well as neutral field inspectors \u2013 have all said, unanimously, that it's a playable field.\"\n\nAn official for the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) contacted by USA TODAY Sports had no comment, maintaining that the union will address the issue publicly on Wednesday when its new executive director, Lloyd Howell Jr., will conduct his first news conference since succeeding DeMaurice Smith. The NFLPA in recent years has been adamant in raising concerns about the quality of fields and the risks to safety.\n\nIn this case, a year after criticism surfaced regarding the condition of the gameday field used for Super Bowl 57 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, the 49ers' primary beef is apparently measurable. According to Jones' report, the 49ers prefer a field with a firmness of 70g (units of gravity), while the practice fields installed at UNLV measured at 50g. Without a surface installed between the sod and the artificial turf, the fields were described as \"spongey.\"\n\nPerhaps the solution comes with raising the standards. In any event, the 49ers are resigned to take it as is.\n\n\"We'll deal with what we've got,\" Shanahan said. \"We're good. We're not going to change our schedule.\"\n\nImagine the disruption that would have ensued if the 49ers had to revamp their practice schedule due to shoddy fields. Talk about the need to limit distractions. Switching practice sites at this point would have been a logistical nightmare.\n\nThe optics for the NFL would have been even worse. It would have been a huge embarrassment if one of the teams in the NFL's signature event had to find an alternative practice site.\n\nJust think: A league worth billions can't even ensure that there are suitable practice fields for its showcase event?\n\nIt's seemingly a hypothetical question now, in part because the 49ers have dropped the issue. It's unknown whether the 49ers were pressured by the league to move on, but it seems clear that the NFL has avoided some embarrassing drama.\n\nShanahan said that he's \"not worried at all\" about the conditions of the field. \"It improves each day.\"\n\nMaybe George Kittle, the thoughtful and loquacious 49ers tight end, can provide the straight scoop.\n\nOr, maybe there's no headline there.\n\n\"I'm playing football in February. I have nothing to complain about,\" Kittle said from his podium on Monday night. \"I'm in Las Vegas, at the Super Bowl playing football with my teammates for an extra week. There's only two teams doing it. I have nothing to complain about. No issues for me.\"\n\nThen again, where's Allen Iverson when you really need him to talk about practice?"}

The police department determined the flames were caused by severe weather, and the winds that fanned the fires created a domino effect of chaos for police.\n\nThe fires spread rapidly across the island, fueled by high winds and dry vegetation. As the fire grew in size, the destructive power resulted in black smoke that impeded several evacuations and downed power lines that made it nearly impossible to communicate, according to the report.\n\nThe tragedy was compounded by a strenuous search for victims that extended to the ocean off the coast. Officers' accounts in the report and body camera footage revealed that extreme conditions, misinformation, and widespread confusion affected the emergency response.\n\nIn the report, Maui police provided 32 recommendations for ways the police department could better respond in a similar emergency or natural disaster, including implementing better equipment and improving communication between officers and other emergency personnel.\n\n\"In policing, we respond to dynamic and evolving situations,\" Pelletier wrote in the report. \"We cannot control the incidents we respond to; we can, however, control our responses in the aftermath.\"\n\n'Downright inhumane':Maui victims plea for aid after fires charred homes, lives, history\n\nMaui police preliminary report comes from several probes\n\nThe report, which was reviewed by two outside police agencies, will be distributed to law enforcement agencies across the United States as a resource for catastrophe preparation and response. The report will be finalized six to 12 months from now, Pelletier said at the news conference.\n\nThe revelations released Monday come from one of several probes into the cause of the fires. Several lawsuits have been filed in the last six months since the disaster left thousands of structures on the island leveled and devastated the spirit of Lahaina.\n\nDespite remaining questions and criticism over the cause of the fires and what, or who may have exacerbated them, the Maui Police Department's investigation solely focused on its response.\n\nThe Hawaii attorney general\u2019s office selected outside experts to investigate the fires. Attorney General Anne Lopez announced last November that her office continues to aggressively push the first phase of the independent investigation forward.\n\nLed by the Fire Safety Research Institute, the probe is expected to take at least several more months to be completed.\n\nWhat were the police's recommendations?\n\nThe report's recommendations mostly called for upgraded equipment and technology, such as issuing radio earpieces for officers to better hear and equipping every supervisory police vehicle with a breaching kit to remove debris.\n\nRecommendations also included improving communications between police and other emergency personnel, such as stationing a senior officer \u2014 a lieutenant or higher \u2014 in the communications center as a liaison to police commanders.\n\nOther recommendations made in the report were:\n\nUpdating the department's body-worn camera policy to have body-worn cameras activated upon dispatch because \"in the midst of the chaos created by the fires, officers faced many obstacles regarding body-worn cameras, including the inability of some officers to retrieve and/or activate their body-worn camera.\"\n\nDirecting calls to a dedicated phone line in the event of a disaster \"so that the public knows who to call, i.e. for road closures, hazards, evacuations shelters or any other emergency messaging.\" The report reads: \"Dispatch received many phone calls asking for updates on road closures. Callers complained that phone updates were not communicated in a timely manner.\"\n\nContinuing death investigation education for officers, \"as some of the initial documentation and photography could have offered more context with better coverage and details.\"\n\nInstalling \"real-time crime center cameras\" throughout Maui County \"to detect and alert the presence of smoke and fire.\"\n\nWhat else did the report say?\n\n\"During the hours of August 8, 2023, Maui became the stage for the most tragic natural disaster in state history and the deadliest fire in modern American history,\" Pelletier wrote in the report. \"In the days and months since this incident, the Maui Police Department has worked uncompromisingly to detail our response.\"\n\nThe report offered a detailed timeline of Maui police's response, starting with a brush fire in the Upcountry region that ignited in the early hours of Aug. 8. Authorities ordered evacuations amid high winds, downed trees and power lines, and other structural destruction.\n\nBy 8:19 a.m. local time, the Lahaina fire was reported to be 90% contained, according to the report. But in the hours following, more reports of debris and downed live wires were received as gusty winds moved through the area.\n\nAt 2:55 p.m., a caller reported smoke and fire that was spreading fast in the area, according to the report. Sixteen more calls were received in the next three minutes describing the same smoke and fire.\n\nAfter the fire's quick flareup, officers described in the report their efforts to help residents in the chaos.\n\n\"They encountered significant challenges due to heavy smoke, decreasing visibility, and heavy traffic which had caused a gridlock,\" an account said. \"Despite these conditions, they continued evacuation efforts using their P.A. system to guide residents.\"\n\nThe fire later spread toward the Lahaina Civic Center, \"prompting a large-scale evacuation of over a thousand people, many without vehicles,\" another account described. As part of rescue efforts, police and fire personnel transported \"hundreds of citizens within their emergency vehicles to safety,\" the report said.\n\n'She loved the island'Family of woman who died in Maui wildfires sues county, state\n\nFirst inside look at the wildfire victims: Most people who died were elderly\n\nThe report lists the names of the 97 wildfire victims and gives the first inside look into the demographics and whereabouts of the Maui residents who were killed in the tragedy.\n\nThe Maui Police Department's Morgue Identification and Notification task force found:\n\nA majority of the wildfire victims were between the ages of 60 and 79 years old.\n\nMore men died than women; 61% of the victims were men and 39% of the victims were women.\n\nThree children under the age of 19 died. One was 14. Another was 11. And the youngest was 7.\n\nForty-two people died in structures; 15 people died sheltering in cars; 39 people died outdoors; three people died in a hospital in Oahu; and one person was found in the water.\n\nOn Aug. 9, the first fatality was confirmed, according to the report, adding that victim recovery \"would take weeks.\" The last recovery was made on Oct. 12, said Jeremy Stuelpnagel, a forensic pathologist, at the news conference Monday.\n\nMaui Police Department Officer Brad Taylor said the task force investigated all of the estimated 3,000 missing persons investigations. DNA sampling helped them to recover some of the missing persons and identify those who died during the disaster.\n\nPelletier praised the police department at the conclusion of Monday's news conference.\n\n\"Think about it: 9/11 happened, Pearl Harbor happened and we are still identifying those lost today. Just last week, we were able to to bring closure to last family,\" Pelletier said. \"These were our worst hours. These were our finest moments. We are Maui Strong.\"\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com. Follow her on X at @kaylajjimenez."}

Ren\u00e9e Zellweger played Roxie in the 2002 film adaptation that landed her an Oscar nomination.\n\n'The Ariana Roxie is going to be unlike anyone else'\n\nAhead of her debut, Madix told the Associated Press that she dealt with positive and negative responses to her part in the play and has decided to ignore both.\n\n\"The Ariana Roxie is going to be unlike anyone else because we're all different people, and we're all going to bring our own experiences to it, so I'm really looking forward to that,\" Madix told the AP. \"You don't pay attention to the positive or the negative that is said, but I do get very nervous.

The highly dramatic show isn't shy on the tears, nudity or eyebrow-raising drama.\n\nThe show follows the lives of people who worked at the West Hollywood restaurant SUR, which is owned by Vanderpump. Madix, a Melbourne, Florida, native and Flagler College alumna, became a fan favorite on the reality show.\n\nIn the beginning, Madix tended bar on the show along with her then-boyfriend, Tom Sandoval, and his ex, Kristen Doute.\n\nThe 38-year-old was embroiled in a scandal on the hit show after news broke in 2022 about Sandoval cheating on her with their friend and fellow cast member Raquel Levis. Dubbed as \"Scandoval,\" Madix drew sympathy from all corners of the internet and saw an influx in interest on her life.\n\nSince the scandal, Madix has stayed mostly tight-lipped about the incident beyond some social media posts and chats with Bravo's Andy Cohen. The move has led to her making it out on top, becoming the subject of many high-profile magazine covers and appearances on other shows.\n\nDid Ariana Madix win 'Dancing with the Stars'?\n\nAfter weathering through the \"Scandoval\" storm, Madix joined the season 32 cast of \"Dancing with the Stars.\"\n\nMadix and DWTS partner Pasha Pashkov placed third behind singer Jason Mraz and Daniella Karagach.\n\nMarvel star Xochitl Gomez (\"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\") and dance pro Val Chmerkovskiy took home the Len Goodman Mirrorball trophy.\n\nContributing: Taijuan Moorman and Naledi Ushe, USA TODAY; Gianna Montesano, TCPalm"}

The drug is most commonly used in the U.S. by ingesting it as a powder, which can be white, brown or black.\n\nThe highly addictive opioid hasn't been widely distributed in its liquid form until recently, according to a rehabilitation center in Los Angeles.\n\nHere's what to know about liquid heroin and the case that is shining a light on the dangerous drug.\n\nWhat is liquid heroin?\n\nLiquid heroin is powdered heroin dissolved in water that is then heated and injected, according to the Tampa, Florida-based Clean Recovery Centers, which works helps rehabilitate people who've used the drug. Powder or even pills also can be turned into a serum and easily injected.\n\nThe liquid version of the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier faster than other forms, \"leading to its intense effects and high potential for heroin addiction,\" according to Compassion Behavioral Health of Los Angeles.\n\nThe heroin metabolizes as morphine that then 'binds to opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and other organs, resulting in a powerful analgesic and euphoric effect.\"\n\nThe effects of liquid heroin on the body\n\nThe use of liquid heroin comes with some serious and often deadly side effects, according to Compassion Behavioral Health. They include:\n\nDrowsiness\n\nImpaired cognition\n\nDecreased respiratory function\n\nA suppressed immune system\n\nFor those who become addicted, long-term effects could include:\n\nLiver and kidney damage\n\nRespiratory disorders\n\nIncreased susceptibility to infectious diseases\n\nMental health problems\n\nImpaired daily function\n\nWhat is lean heroin?\n\nLean isn't heroin, but is sometimes still called that.\n\nLean, also known by its street name of \"purple drank,\" is a liquid substance with Codeine as its key component. The codeine, an opioid pain reliever used to treat mild to moderately severe pain, according to the Food and Drug Administration, is then mixed with the following:\n\nCough syrup\n\nSoda\n\nHard candy\n\nAlcohol\n\nAntihistamines\n\nLean, just like liquid heroin, is a quick shot to the nervous system and highly addictive.

Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer,\" Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe palace also informed that His Majesty was \"advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties\" amid his treatment.\n\nPrince William will preside over investiture ceremony, a charity dinner this week\n\nWith both Charles and Kate out of the public eye, experts predict William will have added responsibilities in his role within the royal family.\n\n\"I also just feel like the pressure on William has never been greater because his wife is not able to participate, he has three children he's kind of helping look after, as he should, and then now, he has to kind of carry the weight (of father King Charles),\" royal observer Rachel Bowie, who co-hosts the popular \"Royally Obsessed\" podcast, told USA TODAY.\n\nWilliam, who'd taken time off to look after the couple's three children, is due to preside over an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace and a charity dinner on Wednesday.\n\nThough the palace's candor about royal health issues was a change from typical protocol, the kind of cancer Charles has and its severity has not been disclosed.\n\nThe monarchy's next large-scale event is Commonwealth Day on March 11, which is typically marked by a service at Westminster Abbey. In previous years, Charles and the late Queen Elizabeth II have repledged their commitments to the British Commonwealth nations.\n\nIt's unclear if the service will continue and to what capacity.\n\nKing Charles' cancer diagnosis:How we talk about it matters \u2014 here's why\n\nPrince William is first in the line of succession if King Charles dies\n\nAs the first in line to the throne, William is generally regarded as the second in command.\n\n\"We're set to see William return to royal duties on Wednesday, but I do feel like when you look at the monarchy right now \u2026 just with the prostate treatment that Charles was undergoing when everything seemed fine, and then you have Kate out of commission, I think it really does make you think about just how slim the monarchy feels,\" Bowie said on Monday.\n\nCharles took the throne intending to preside over a slimmed-down monarchy with fewer senior royals carrying out ceremonial public duties. But with Charles and Kate both temporarily sidelined, Prince Harry self-exiled to California and Prince Andrew largely banished from view because of his friendship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the royal firm risks becoming severely overstretched.\n\nAt Charles' coronation in May, the Prince of Wales swore his loyalty to his father in a ceremony known as \"The Homage of Royal Blood.\"\n\nWilliam kneeled before his father, placing his hands in between Charles' hands as he said, \"I, William, Prince of Wales, pledge my loyalty to you and faith and truth I will bear unto you, as your liege man of life and limb. So help me God.\"\n\nThe ceremonious vow took place shortly after Charles' crowning and \"The Homage of The Church of England,\" which was carried out by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nWhat we know so far:King Charles diagnosed after hospitalization for prostate procedure\n\nWilliam's children \u2014 Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5 \u2014 are next in the line of succession, followed by Prince Harry and his children, Archie, 4, and Lilibet, 2.\n\nWilliam has already stepped up since Charles' ascension to the throne after the death of the late Queen Elizabeth II by being more active in charities related to the environment, a cause his father was very passionate about before becoming king.\n\nBowie said the king's cancer diagnosis makes her \"worried\" as Harry prepares to travel to Britain, calling it a \"royal rollercoaster.\"\n\nHow long has Charles been king?\n\nThough he legally became king when his mother died, Charles has officially been king of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for less than a year, since his coronation in May after succeeding Elizabeth, Britain's longest-serving monarch.\n\nHe was the oldest monarch to be crowned in British history last spring after serving for seven decades as the monarch-in-waiting after he was made the heir apparent at 3 years old following the death of his grandfather, King George VI.\n\nAs the 41st British monarch since William the Conqueror in 1066, Elizabeth was the symbol of stability as Britain and its near 1,000-year-old monarchy sailed through roiling storms of history.\n\nCold life-expectancy calculations suggest Charles' reign will not come close to matching his mother's in years. He's more likely to echo the experience of one of his ancestors, Edward VII, who waited almost 60 years to succeed his mother Queen Victoria in 1901, and then reigned for only nine years.\n\nChristopher Andersen, author of multiple royal biographies thinks Charles could still enjoy a longish reign given his parents' longevity. (His father, Philip, died just short of his 100th birthday.)\n\nEngland's shortest reign was held by Lady Jane Grey, known as the \"nine-day queen,\" who in 1553 ascended the throne at 16 years old. Nine days later, Mary Tudor claimed the throne. In February 1554, Lady Jane and her husband were beheaded at the Tower of London.\n\nKing Charles has cancerand we don\u2019t know what kind. How we talk about it matters.\n\nPrince William took over King Charles' title as the Prince of Wales\n\nIn a national address to the nation in September 2022, the king paid tribute to his mother Elizabeth II and named his eldest son William the Prince of Wales, a move signifying his shifting rank in the family.\n\nWith that, the former Kate Middleton became the Princess of Wales, the first to hold that title since the death of William's mother, the late Princess Diana, in 1997. In fact, she is one of only three princesses to be known as Princess of Wales since 1901.\n\n\"Today, I am proud to create him Prince of Wales, Tywysog Cymru, the country whose title I have been so greatly privileged to bear during so much of my life and duty,\" the king said in the pre-recorded speech. \"With Catherine beside him, our new Prince and Princess of Wales will, I know, continue to inspire and lead our national conversations, helping to bring the marginal to the center ground where vital help can be given.\"\n\nThe royal family tree:A guide to the British monarchy and succession\n\nContributing: KiMi Robinson, Nicole Fallert, Maria Puente, USA TODAY; Danica Kirka, Sylvia Hui and Jill Lawless, The Associated Press"}

The storm hit parts of Nevada on Sunday and will last until Tuesday, bringing heavy rainfall and snow.\n\n\"This storm is not letting up, the roads are dicey even for cars with proper equipment,\" Mount Charleston officials said on X Monday morning.\n\nLatest avalanche incident this year\n\nSo far this year, there have been four avalanche fatalities in the United States, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC).\n\nDozens of avalanche fatalities occur each year across the country, the CAIC said. Incidents mostly involve backcountry skiers, snowboarders, and snowmobilers.\n\nIn January, an avalanche barreled down a ski resort near Lake Tahoe, California, killing one and injuring three others. About a day later, two men were rescued and one man was presumed dead after an avalanche swept through a mountain on Idaho's panhandle.\n\nStay in the know:For more updates, sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing.\n\nAvalanche risk increases amid surge in backcountry recreation\n\nAvalanche prevention experts have warned of an increased risk of avalanches as more skiers and snowmobilers visit backcountry areas each year. Extreme weather, including the recent winter storms, also contributes to avalanche conditions.\n\nThe minimal snowfall across the western United States in the early season has created an unstable layer at the bottom of the snowpack, The Associated Press reported. Dangerous conditions are likely to continue for months, Doug Chabot, director of the Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center, told AP.\n\nLast month, the CAIC reported an uptick in avalanche activity across Colorado.\n\nBy early January, the state had already recorded over 900 avalanches. Since the season began on Oct. 1, Colorado has experienced about 2,000 avalanches, CAIC spokesperson Kelsy Been previously told USA TODAY.\n\nThe high number of avalanches wasn't surprising due to the conditions caused by recent storms. Officials knew it was \"going to be really dangerous and cause a lot of avalanches,\" Been said.\n\n'Considerable' risk before incident:Forecast warned of avalanche risk ahead of deadly avalanche at Palisades Tahoe ski resort\n\nContributing: Amaris Encinas, USA TODAY"}

It also plans to throw out a $50 million donation to educational nonprofits, in an attempt to soften the blow from recent challenges with the launch of the new Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, a form that millions of families use each year to get help paying for college.\n\nIn particular, the support is coming in hopes that high school seniors and transfer students across the country have a reasonable amount of time to compare their financial aid offers from different schools before they make their final decisions.\n\nOn a call with reporters Monday, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said that while he understands recent delays with the form have been frustrating for colleges and universities, they've aggravated him, too. He continued to suggest there are families reporting that the now-simplified form has been easier to fill out this year than ever before.\n\nHe laid part of the blame on Washington gridlock.\n\nLearn more: Best personal loans\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked to deliver more with less,\u201d he said, \u201cas Congress continues to flat-fund federal student aid despite the transformational work we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nWhat is the Department of Education planning to do?\n\nThe plan is to deploy at least 50 federal student aid experts in the next three weeks to under-resourced schools, including historically Black colleges and universities and tribal colleges and universities.\n\nThe Education Department will also set up a financial aid \u201cconcierge service\u201d in the next 24 hours for schools to contact for help.\n\nOver the next couple of months, the agency will disburse $50 million to nonprofits for additional technical assistance and support.\n\nWithin the next two weeks, officials will release new tools and test data to help colleges and universities ready their processing systems.\n\nExplore all your options:FAFSA freaking you out? It's usually the best choice, but other financial aid options exist\n\nThe department emphasized that the additional help will accelerate its ongoing work to debug the new FAFSA. Officials said they remain confident all students applying for financial aid will receive what they need to attend college, despite glitches that remain unresolved.\n\n\"Ensuring our nation\u2019s colleges and universities are prepared to assist in the massive overhaul of the FAFSA is critical for a smooth implementation, and we are excited to be partners in this work,\" said Justin Draeger, president of the nonprofit National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA), in a statement. NASFAA, which has been critical of the Biden administration\u2019s less-than-perfect reform of the FAFSA, is one of the beneficiaries of the $50 million in funding to help students and schools.\n\nFor the 2024-25 school year, the FAFSA was reduced to just 36 questions from 108, including detailed financial information. The Education Department also made it easier for families to import their income data from tax records.\n\nAlong with the pared-down form, the federal government altered its formulas to determine who will qualify for aid and how much money they\u2019ll receive. The long-awaited changes fulfill legislation passed in 2020."}

For the second time in four years, the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs will duke it out for the Lombardi Trophy. However, the paths that each of these teams took to reach this point have been very different.\n\nThe 49ers were the NFC's top seed and didn't need to play in the wild card round. They also struggled against the conference's 7th-seed in the divisional round, needing a remarkable come-from-behind victory against the Green Bay Packers. The following week, the 49ers doubled down on that tactic, needing 27 second half points to take down the Detroit Lions in the conference championship game.\n\nThe Chiefs meanwhile limped into the playoffs, going just .500 over their last ten games of the regular season and falling to the AFC's third seed after a stellar 6-1 start. However, once the playoffs started, the Chiefs reminded us all why they are this decade's dynasty. They've already taken down three of the most potent offenses in the NFL, but now they face the NFL's most efficient offense.

The Chiefs did not score once in the second half, but held the Ravens and MVP favorite Lamar Jackson to just three points after the first quarter.\n\nNFC:\n\nStandings:\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (12-5) Dallas Cowboys (12-5) *eliminated by GB in wild card round Detroit Lions (12-5) *eliminated by SF in conference championship Tampa Bay Buccaneers (9-8) *eliminated by DET in divisional round Philadelphia Eagles (11-6) *eliminated by TB in wild card round Los Angeles Rams (10-7) *eliminated by DET in wild card round Green Bay Packers (9-8) *eliminated by SF in divisional round\n\nThe Detroit Lions were as close as any team can be to representing the NFC in the Super Bowl. However, after building up a 17-point lead in the first half, the 49ers stormed back and won the second half 27-7 to secure the victory 34-31. 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy became the first quarterback in 30 years to throw for 150 yards, complete 80 percent of his passes, rush for 45 yards, average ten yards a carry, and record zero turnovers in a single half.\n\nSuper Bowl 58:\n\nIn a rematch of Super Bowl 54, the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will square off in Super Bowl 58. The Chiefs won the first matchup 31-20, with Patrick Mahomes and company scoring 21 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to brush off a ten-point second half deficit and secure the franchise's first Super Bowl since 1969.\n\n2023-24 NFL remaining playoffs schedule (all times ET)\n\nNow that the Pro Bowl is behind us, the Super Bowl is set for this Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024.

The devices cause chaos in the city as characters lose their sense of space, walking into light poles and falling into manholes.\n\nThe show has been called clairvoyant by some though showrunners have repeatedly said that the \"predictions\" it has made are coincidental.\n\n\"I would say in general when people say, 'The Simpsons' has predicted something, it is just that we were satirizing real-life events from years before, and because history keeps repeating, it just seems like we were predicting things,\" former showrunner Bill Oakley said in a 2020 Reuters interview.\n\nPrevious 'Simpsons' predictions\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro phenomenon is not the first time \"The Simpsons\" has appeared to predict events on the other side of the screen.\n\nA 1993 episode, \"$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling),\" saw the show foreshadow the mauling of Roy Horn by a white Bengal tiger during a Siegfried and Roy show nearly 10 years before it happened. The 1998 episode \"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\" saw Homer estimate the mass of the Higgs boson particle 14 years before the particle's discovery.\n\nAnd in the 1994 episode \"Lisa on Ice,\" Nelson attempt to set a reminder to \"Beat up Martin\" in the Newton, a progenitor to the iPhone.

Choose your plan ArrowRight El Salvador is the site of a startling \u2014 and, to many liberals, disturbing \u2014 political project. Under President Nayib Bukele, who won reelection in a crushing landslide over the weekend, the country has shifted from what was a functional multiparty democracy to a de facto one-party state. Backed by a parliamentary supermajority, Bukele packed the country\u2019s constitutional court with loyalists. They later issued a ruling that allowed him to circumvent prohibitions against presidents holding office longer than one term.\n\nBukele is embarking on a second five-year stint in office where his power will be paramount, the country\u2019s legislature a rubber stamp for the agenda of the executive and the opposition a feeble shadow. And Salvadorans are ecstatic. Bukele commands some of the highest approval ratings of any leader in the world and won Sunday\u2019s presidential vote by close to a 90 percent margin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis astonishing popularity hinges on one critical issue: Since winning the presidency in 2019, Bukele has masterminded a sweeping crackdown on gangs and cartels that proliferated for years throughout El Salvador and through networks across the region. His tough approach has lowered the country\u2019s once world-leading homicide rates and brought a degree of safety to Salvadoran neighborhoods. It\u2019s also inspired politicians, especially on the right, across Latin America to try to replicate the Bukele model.\n\nCritics, though, point to its heavy-handed overreach. For two years, the country\u2019s legislature granted Bukele emergency powers to carry out his fight against crime. \u201cBukele\u2019s government has used emergency powers to jail more than 72,000 suspects \u2014 giving El Salvador the world\u2019s highest lockup rate,\u201d explained my colleague Mary Beth Sheridan last year. \u201cThey face mass trials of up to 900 defendants. Human rights groups say many were arrested arbitrarily. The government has acknowledged some errors, freeing around 7,000.\u201d\n\nBukele, 42, has scoffed at his critics, including officials in the Biden administration, which said the 2021 court ruling that paved the way for Bukele\u2019s second term \u201cundermines democracy.\u201d Suave and irreverent, Bukele then jokingly rebranded his bio on Twitter, now known as X, as \u201cthe coolest dictator in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vast majority of Salvadorans appeared unfussed, drawn instead to the populist promise inherent in Bukele\u2019s pitch to smash a failed status quo that presided over stagnation, corruption and poverty. \u201cIt will be the first time in a country that just one party exists in a completely democratic system,\u201d Bukele exulted before cheering crowds on Sunday night, adding that \u201cthe entire opposition together was pulverized.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s largely undeniable. \u201cEl Salvador\u2019s traditional parties from the left and right that created the vacuum that Bukele first filled in 2019 remain in shambles,\u201d noted the Associated Press. \u201cAlternating in power for some three decades, the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and leftist Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front (FMLN) were thoroughly discredited by their own corruption and ineffectiveness.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe Salvadoran president cast the election as a referendum on his way of doing things in a society traumatized by decades of violence. \u201cWhy are there so many eyes on a small (Latin) American country?\u201d Bukele said to his supporters. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of the power of example.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBukele\u2019s bio on X no longer mentions anything about being a dictator. Now, he simply identifies as a \u201cphilosopher king.\u201d\n\nBukele\u2019s success in El Salvador reflects a set of politics that transcends his small Central American nation. In both developing and developed countries, democracies are facing historic tests. Polls show mounting public apathy from voters, particularly young people, and growing disenchantment with the ideals of liberal democracy itself.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this growing rejection of the basic principles of democracy and human rights, and support for authoritarian populism among people who feel that, concepts like democracy and human rights and due process have failed them,\u201d Tyler Mattiace, Americas researcher for Human Rights Watch, told the AP.\n\nFor this reason, Bukele has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among the U.S. right. \u201cThe American liberal media cannot comprehend that enforcing hard authority might make a society better, and counterintuitively, more free and liberal,\u201d declared the American Conservative, adding that Bukele \u201cprovides a time-tested, successful alternative to the liberal model of governance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the path forward for Bukele is far from smooth. His anti-gang measures are wildly popular, but his country\u2019s economic position remains fraught \u2014 inflation is a mounting problem, and El Salvador still has high rates of poverty and unemployment. Bukele\u2019s attention-grabbing, quixotic bid to make bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador has done little to address deeper problems.\n\n\u201cShowmanship is no substitute for governance, and the second term will inevitably increase pressure on Bukele to address the state of the economy,\u201d wrote Christine Wade, a political scientist focused on Latin America at Washington College. \u201cWith food insecurity on the rise and exports in decline, Bukele will have to have to address the country\u2019s socioeconomic ailments with policies that prove more effective than his stalled Bitcoin initiative.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf prices continue to rise and the government is unable to respond, Bukele\u2019s five-year run of strong popularity may end in his second term,\u201d Valeria V\u00e1squez, senior analyst for Central America at Control Risks consultancy, told Americas Quarterly. \u201cHowever, given the erosion of the political opposition and the country\u2019s checks and balances, it will be difficult for any serious challenge to emerge.\u201d"}

I had no idea they wanted to adopt, or else I would have told her that myself. We don\u2019t really know what to say to Susan because, well, between the two of them, they have six degrees, so surely they know that starting a family at 45 wasn\u2019t the most realistic choice? Again, no judgment here!\n\nIt\u2019s more that I\u2019m shocked at their attitudes. The only thing Susan ever says on the issue is, \u201cIt\u2019s just not fair!

I\u2019m a nonpracticing Catholic, but symbolism is still important to me, so I cannot see putting the ring back into circulation.\n\nI wanted to hire a Hobbit to schlep the ring across Mordor and toss it into the Lake of Fire.

She passed by some neighbors and two strangers, who had stopped to look at a pile of mud, broken chairs, grass, wooden pieces of garage, a sodden children\u2019s book, tree roots and a painting wrapped in a blanket and cellophane.\n\nAbout 12 hours earlier, around 10 p.m. Sunday, her father, stepmom and younger brother barely escaped a mudslide that swept through their living room, sending them sprinting out the door, over a fence and onto their neighbor\u2019s sloping driveway above. They weren\u2019t able to grab anything, not even their turtle, who is the size of a dinner plate and who they tried to catch before the mud crashed through the home.\n\nRouse knew the violent mudslide had swept away some of her family\u2019s keepsakes and other possessions. But her neighbors were unaware of that when they stood next to the pile of debris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI wonder what that is,\u201d she heard one of them say. She paused, and then decided to tell them, \u201cThat\u2019s my stuff; those are my family\u2019s things.\u201d\n\nThe Rouse family live in Fryman Canyon, a forested neighborhood in Studio City mostly surrounded by hills and trails. After hours and hours of fast, heavy rain, that soil gave way. Los Angeles authorities quickly evacuated about a dozen homes, walking up and calmly knocking on doors because their trucks were too big to get up the winding streets, one resident said. Another recalled how, at 2 a.m., he had come home from the Grammy Awards show \u201cto this,\u201d gesturing at the piles of rocks and belongings in front of his gated driveway.\n\nComing home to a mudslide is a surreal but very real snapshot of living in California. Many people live densely packed in dry, fire-prone canyons, where the charred soil can\u2019t remain in place when torrential rains bear down, as they did this week. Shocked residents said they hadn\u2019t seen anything like this since the El Ni\u00f1o-fueled floods and mudslides of 1997-1998, which killed 17 people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Rouse rushed to see what was left of her dad\u2019s house, she watched as reporters, neighbors and strangers gawked at the belongings and memories that once made up her family\u2019s living room. It was difficult for her to express her feelings seeing their possessions strewn down the street, but she wanted people to know that what they were tramping over \u2014 taking photos of \u2014 mattered.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when this reporter became a part of this story.\n\nAbout an hour earlier and about a mile down the hill, I had spotted a woman plucking a battered silver teapot out of the mud near her home. It was not hers, she told me. She saw it floating in the mud and knew it belonged to a family who lost a lot, so she went hunting for the rest of the set. Earlier that morning, she had also seen their refrigerator coursing down the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMaybe this is sentimental,\u201d she said, holding a matching mud-caked chalice. Nearby, a scoop tractor was pushing debris into piles, crushing whatever was underneath. The woman didn\u2019t want it to be taken away, for the family to lose more.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWalking through her debris-filled street, I spotted two photographs, their corners jutting out of the mud. One was of an old \u201990s Little League team, the other of a boy in his uniform, holding a mitt. A child\u2019s baseball cleat was a few feet away. I put them in my car, because as someone who lost family photos, heirlooms and childhood mementos in the 2018 Woolsey Fire \u2014 and who has spent years taking disaster victims back to ash and rubble and watching them comb through piles for hours in search of anything tangible from their old lives that they could keep \u2014 I know what finding pieces of the \u201cbefore\u201d mean.\n\nAn hour later, I was standing with two other residents surveying the wreckage, wondering what it was when Jessica Rouse walked by and told me, \u201cThat\u2019s my stuff.\u201d When I heard that, it clicked. Perhaps those photos and the silver were hers, too. A few minutes later, holding the Little League print, she pointed to a small girl smiling in the front row. \u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d she said. That was her childhood memento. The boy with the glove was her brother. The silver set, a family heirloom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you found these,\u201d Rouse said a few times. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nI had also found her father\u2019s wallet, completely inundated with mud, all the cards and cash still in their place.\n\nThe Rouses, along with other families whose homes slid off their foundations, were inundated with mud or water, or were crushed by trees, have difficult months and years ahead. Most insurance does not cover mudslide, mud and debris flow damage, and many people in California don\u2019t have flood insurance. And you never get over loss like that. When asked about help, Jessica Rouse thought about the family turtle, who is still missing, and asked for people to be on the lookout.\n\nDespite all that, California got pretty lucky with these atmospheric rivers, which dumped more rain at once than most people can remember. Some homes slid, some flooded, some were crushed by trees. But for the most part, communities in Los Angeles and up the coast came out unscathed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolding your breath and praying that you dodge disaster comes with the territory of living here, said Keki Mingus, who just moved to Fryman Canyon last year. Her family picked this neighborhood because it was out of a fire zone, she said, an imperative after they watched homes around them burn to the ground in the Woolsey Fire that swept through Malibu, where I also grew up. Listening to the winds shake the big oak trees behind their stilted wooden house on Sunday, Mingus and her family knew they would probably fall, that the house would most likely slide off. They again steeled themselves for loss as they listened to what they thought was thunder but later learned was the \u201cwhoosh of the hillside come down.\u201d\n\nBy Monday afternoon, that loss hadn\u2019t come, at least not for them. Only one branch fell, and they let out a tentative sigh of relief that, somehow, they made it through another one. They had dodged another weather event that could have changed their lives in an instant \u2014 in which the photos in the debris could have been theirs."}

But McDaniel has faced a groundswell of criticism from the grass roots of the party.\n\n\u201cIs it time for Ronna McDaniel to step aside?\u201d a Newsmax reporter asked Trump in a televised interview Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think she knows that, I think she understands that,\u201d Trump responded.\n\nBut hours after that interview was recorded \u2014 and following a meeting with McDaniel at his Mar-a-Lago Club in South Florida which lasted more than two hours \u2014 Trump sent a message on his Truth Social media site: \u201cRonna is now Head of the RNC, and I\u2019ll be making a decision the day after the South Carolina Primary as to my recommendations for RNC Growth.\u201d\n\nThe remarks came one day after Trump said changes were coming at the RNC in a Fox Business interview. In the past, he had assiduously defended McDaniel amid widespread criticism from parts of his movement.\n\nTwo people familiar with Monday\u2019s meeting described it as friendly and said Trump made no ultimatums. One of the people said McDaniel was not committed to staying through Election Day but had not decided to leave yet, and that Trump has not committed to any decision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has begun positing about replacements, including Joe Gruters of Florida and Michael Whatley of North Carolina, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nMcDaniel was overwhelmingly reelected in 2023 after some critics called for her to be deposed following the party\u2019s disappointing performance in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nMcDaniel is well liked among the party committee\u2019s 168 members but has drawn extensive criticism from agitators on the right, who attacked her for insufficient fundraising and claimed that she was not loyal to Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has increasingly grown frustrated with McDaniel\u2019s leadership. They have worried over what they view as the RNC\u2019s lackluster fundraising, as well as the more muscular role they hoped the committee could play in a general election matchup with President Biden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump was also annoyed with McDaniel for playing a part in holding presidential debates \u2014 he wanted her to cancel them and declare him the nominee last fall. Trump also has repeatedly told advisers that McDaniel was not doing enough on \u201celection integrity,\u201d according to people who heard his comments, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal discussions. The party struggled to raise money in 2023 and entered the presidential year with about half as much money as the Democratic Party, campaign filings show.\n\nHer defenders say McDaniel has held the party together during seven difficult years and that Trump was to blame for much of the party\u2019s struggles, not McDaniel.\n\n\u201cIf Trump wants to understand why we lost in 2018, 2020 and 2022, all he has to do is look in the mirror. Ronna isn\u2019t a magician,\u201d said RNC member Henry Barbour, who has criticized Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump \u2014 a consummate host in his pre-political life \u2014 often finds himself trying to win over whoever is directly in front of him, which can cause confusion as to what he truly intends.\n\nThe whiplash in his views of McDaniel, for instance, seems to stem in part from his desire to offer a forceful anti-McDaniel note to the conservative Newsmax base, while coming around to McDaniel\u2019s appeal following a face-to-face meeting with her several hours later.\n\nMcDaniel ran for a fourth term against the advice of some leading Republicans and advisers.\n\nMcDaniel, the niece of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) who abandoned using \u201cRomney\u201d as part of her name after the 2016 election, comes from a storied family in Republican politics and has been viewed as a bridge between Trump and the party\u2019s more establishment, corporate class. She is well liked by some of the party\u2019s top donors, including hotelier Steve Wynn."}

Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter and get advice for life on our changing planet, in your inbox every Tuesday. ArrowRight The atmospheric river that began Sunday arrived with howling winds that gusted above 100 miles per hour in some places and launched what the National Weather Service described as \u201cone of the most dramatic weather days in recent memory.\u201d\n\nAs Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) declared a state of emergency in eight heavily populated counties across Southern California, rescue workers pulled 19 people off a 40-foot sailboat with a snapped mast and extracted drivers from swamped cars. At least two people were killed by falling trees farther north in the state. By Monday afternoon, around half a million people in California remained without power.\n\nThe deluge is part of a growing pattern of supercharged storms feeding off unusually warm waters in the Pacific Ocean driven by climate change and the periodic pattern known as El Ni\u00f1o that returned last year. The storm dropped up to 10 inches of rain across the Los Angeles area since Sunday, more than falls in some years, and the Weather Service warned that the already significant flooding was expected to worsen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe storm unleashed torrents of water across the state. Retaining walls collapsed, boulders and trees crashed down on roadways, mudslides damaged homes, and flash floods closed down portions of Interstate 5 and other major highways.\n\n\u201cStay safe and off the roads,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told residents during a news conference Monday from the city\u2019s emergency operations center. \u201cOnly leave your house if it is absolutely necessary.\u201d\n\nCity firefighters rescued a man and his dog from the flooded Los Angeles River during an atmospheric river storm on Feb. 5. (Video: LAPD)\n\nIn the rural mountain community of Boulder Creek, Calif., southwest of San Jose, one person was killed when a tree fell onto their home Sunday afternoon, Ashley Keehn, a spokesperson for the Santa Cruz County Sheriff\u2019s Office, told The Washington Post. The victim is not being identified pending notification of family. A second man was killed by a downed redwood tree in his backyard in Yuba City, north of Sacramento, the local police department said in a statement early Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour people who were reported missing after a possible avalanche in the mountains near Las Vegas were found, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said.\n\nBut emergency personnel in the Los Angeles area \u2014 among the hardest-hit areas \u2014 said the storm hasn\u2019t been particularly destructive so far compared with past disasters.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t seeing major, major impacts,\u201d Emily Montanez, associate director of the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management, said in an interview. She attributed that in part to early warnings and encouraging people not to be out on the roads. \u201cPeople stayed home.\u201d\n\nMontanez said that the county was \u201cnot completely out of the woods\u201d and that pockets of heavy rain could still fall, but more intermittently.\n\nUp among the peaks of the Sierra Nevada, the deluge draped the mountains in a thick blanket of snow, a welcome sign for the state\u2019s water supply as the snowpack has been running below average this year. The Central Sierra Snow Laboratory in the mountain town of Soda Springs recorded nearly 2 feet of snow over the past two days, and other spots have seen more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the storm brought a swampy mess for millions of people in the Los Angeles area, who endured Sunday what was the 10th-wettest day in the history of the city dating back nearly 150 years, according to Bass. The downpour of more than 4 inches downtown easily surpassed the city\u2019s monthly average.\n\nAcross Los Angeles, the city\u2019s police, firefighters and other emergency personnel responded to more than 130 flooding incidents, 49 mud and debris flows, and drivers stuck in floodwaters, Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley said at the news conference.\n\nIn one incident, a mudslide crashed into two homes in Fryman Canyon, a forested neighborhood in Studio City surrounded by hills and trails. At about 10 p.m. Sunday, the river of mud coursed into Jessica Rouse\u2019s living room. She and her father, stepmother, and brother sprinted out the door, over a fence and onto the neighbor\u2019s sloping driveway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRouse said they weren\u2019t able to grab anything before leaving, not even the family\u2019s pet turtle, who was swept away by the mud.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cIt all happened so fast,\u201d Rouse said. \u201cHe was floating away, and they were trying to catch him and couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles authorities evacuated 16 people from the area, where some homes flooded and others were hit by falling trees.\n\nFirefighters were also responding Monday to a mudslide on Beverly Drive in the Hollywood Hills.\n\n\u201cThe hazards of this storm have not passed,\u201d Crowley said during the midday news conference. \u201cWe anticipate another wave of heavy rains later on this afternoon.\u201d\n\nDuring the downpour Sunday night, Karen Moureaux left her Ventura County home when she heard the scraping of heavy machinery. Her neighbors amid the citrus and avocado farms in Fillmore had taken an excavator and worked for hours dredging up mud to try to dislodge a blocked culvert that was flooding the road.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEver since the 2017 Thomas Fire burned through the area, flooding has worsened, Moureaux said, including last year when floodwaters from Sespe Creek reached her farm.\n\n\u201cYou always worry about that road because you know it\u2019s going to flood,\u201d said Moureaux, who grows Valencia oranges and operates a dog-boarding kennel. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a creek; it\u2019s a raging river when we get water.\u201d\n\nAs waters rose in Santa Barbara on Sunday afternoon, residents said they had been hit so hard before by megastorms that they were getting used to it.\n\nAs Bath Street filled with murky water, one woman paced on her porch, hoping she would get lucky like she did last year, when the flood stopped at her front door. Standing on his steps in Crocs, Bix Kaufman and his roommate, Alex Clark, who was drinking a beer, pointed out neighbors who got \u201crocked\u201d last year. Kaufman said watching his street fill with enough water to canoe down now seems normal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re a little desensitized from it from last time because it was so intense,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no flood insurance around here, and it\u2019s probably impossible to get.\u201d\n\nSanta Barbara has been a microcosm of extreme climate events, notes Thomas Tighe, the CEO of Direct Relief, an aid nonprofit headquartered in the city. In the last six years, the coastal county endured what was the largest wildfire in state history at the time and the 2018 Montecito mudslides, which killed 23 people. Tighe lost his home in that disaster and just finished rebuilding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is now,\u201d said Tighe, adding that his organization is seeing these trends everywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we all need to adapt, adjust, and take care of each other as the public officials adapt rapidly, too.\u201d\n\nDespite the downpour, Los Angeles public schools, the second-largest public school district in the country, with more than 400,000 students, planned to remain open for the day, as of Monday morning, with the exception of two schools.\n\nIn the center of this storm, the air pressure dropped quickly and drastically, strengthening into what is known as a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d Such low-pressure systems can spin up fierce winds, and this one tied for California\u2019s strongest bomb cyclone in the past 14 years. The powerful low-pressure system dragged a large plume of water vapor from Hawaii to the West Coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch atmospheric rivers provide critical snow and rain to the West Coast\u2019s annual water supply, but too much rain in a short amount of time can be devastating.\n\nThe amount of snow in California\u2019s mountains has been below average so far this winter. The state\u2019s average snowpack was only 57 percent of normal as of Friday. This storm system will push up that number.\n\nOver the next day or so, the storm is expected to weaken near the California-Oregon border, but the atmospheric river will remain parked around Southern California. Heavy rain will probably continue from Los Angeles down to San Diego, with an additional 2 to 4 inches possible through Tuesday morning.\n\nThe storm system will travel eastward midweek, spreading rain and snow into Arizona, Nevada and further toward the Rocky Mountain front. In Phoenix, the additional rain could cause flooding across the already saturated soil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDesert locations on the southwestern Nevada-California border also could be prone to flooding, as an additional 1 to 2 inches of rain are forecast. Mountains in Nevada, Utah, Colorado and surrounding regions may also see a foot or more of snow midweek."}

James Lankford (Okla.) said he believed Republicans would likely band together to block the legislation on Wednesday \u2014 and that he himself might even vote against it. Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the No. 2 Republican, said everybody agreed Wednesday\u2019s expected procedural vote was \u201ctoo soon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Republican senators, including Lankford, said the conference is discussing whether they would take more time to consider amending the bill after blocking the vote. But immigration reform has proved so toxic for Republican lawmakers that reaching a consensus to change the bill in the near future appears unlikely.\n\nThe rapid collapse in support in the Senate reflects the upside-down politics of the border deal among Republicans that began several weeks ago, when Trump began slamming it. The staunchly conservative union for Border Patrol officers endorsed the deal on Monday, saying it would \u201ccodify into law authorities that U.S. Border Patrol agents never had in the past.\u201d And immigrant and refugee rights groups, including Amnesty International USA, blasted the legislation as containing \u201cthe most extreme anti-immigrant proposals this country has seen in 100 years.\u201d\n\nBut a growing number of Republicans on Capitol Hill have painted the legislation as too soft.\n\nFor years, Republicans said Congress needed to overhaul the U.S. immigration system. Now some of those same Republicans say congressional action is unnecessary. (Video: JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and his leadership team \u2014 who initially demanded House-passed border reforms be attached to Ukraine funding \u2014 spelled out their grievances in a joint statement, saying the legislation \u201cfails\u201d to secure the border and would encourage more illegal immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAny consideration of this Senate bill in its current form is a waste of time,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is DEAD on arrival in the House. We encourage the U.S. Senate to reject it.\u201d\n\nTrump has made addressing the border core to his 2024 election message and told Republican lawmakers not to back the bill even before negotiators released the text.\n\n\u201cThis is a very bad bill for his career,\u201d Trump said of Lankford, the deal\u2019s lead Republican negotiator, who is among the conference\u2019s most conservative members, in an interview with Dan Bongino on Monday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s focused on the campaign,\u201d Lankford said when asked on CNN to respond to Trump\u2019s comment. \u201cI\u2019m going to do whatever I can to secure the nation as fast as I can regardless of election cycle.\u201d\n\nTrump and his allies have mischaracterized the bill, which would also allow for the hiring of thousands more asylum and border officers, and an increase in detention beds, as codifying more illegal migration into the country. Lankford called the misrepresentations \u201cridiculous\u201d in an interview with Fox News on Monday, but several Republican senators said the characterizations had already done their damage with the base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose staff helped negotiate the deal and who is pushing to find a way to get his members to vote for Ukraine and Israel aid, voiced his support, as did Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a moderate.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues know where I stand,\u201d McConnell said earlier on Monday. \u201cThey know as well as I do that America\u2019s adversaries in Moscow, Beijing and Tehran are working together to undermine us.

(Video: U.S. Senate)\n\nBut at least 20 Republican senators had signaled their opposition to the deal as of Monday evening, alongside two Democratic senators who blasted it as too draconian on asylum seekers. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued a statement saying the United States should not provide another \u201cdollar\u201d to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, but it\u2019s unclear whether he would vote no to the entire package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bill would need 60 votes to overcome its first procedural vote, which Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has suggested will be Wednesday. The House is set to vote on a stand-alone $17.6 billion Israel supplemental aid bill this week, in a move meant to pressure the Senate to winnow down its larger package. The White House issued a statement on Monday saying President Biden would veto the legislation if it made it to his desk.\n\nSome of the Republican no votes include right-wing firebrands such as Sen. Mike Lee (Utah), who called for new Senate Republican leadership \u2014 a shot at McConnell \u2014 and Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), who called the deal \u201cINSANE\u201d in a social media post. But far more telling to the bill\u2019s potential future are comments from some senators who are more in the middle of the Republican conference or who have ties to Republican leadership.\n\nSen.

John Cornyn (R-Tex.), a McConnell ally, said he has \u201cquestions and serious concerns\u201d about the legislation, signaling issues with its path forward in the Senate. Sen James E. Risch (Idaho), the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a defense hawk, hinted at his opposition in a social media post, where he called for enforcing the existing laws at the border and stopping \u201cthis insanity.\u201d\n\nSen. Steve Daines (Mont.), the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and a member of the leadership team, also said he was against the bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Republicans pointed to what they see as a \u201cloophole\u201d in the border emergency provision that would allow the president to stop the border closure in a national security emergency, and others to the fact that the legislation would speed up work authorizations for the asylum seekers who pass the new, higher bar, among other concerns.\n\nThe bill had already caused division and infighting among Republican staffers on Monday. A meeting of Republican communications staffers turned contentious after a Lee staffer complained to a Lankford staffer about feeling betrayed. The Lee staffer marched out of the meeting, followed by laughter from other aides, according to two people present who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Another meeting of Republican policy staffers also devolved into yelling and finger-pointing over the deal, according to two Republican aides.\n\n\u201cThe tensions are high all around,\u201d said one Senate GOP aide. \u201cThis bill isn\u2019t going anywhere. Sadly it\u2019s only dividing Republicans and putting Lankford on an island he doesn\u2019t deserve.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother Republican aide said many in the conference believed an immigration deal was always doomed to fail, given the intensity the GOP base has for the issue and the necessity to compromise at least somewhat with Democrats to get to an agreement.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t kill something that was never alive,\u201d the aide said.\n\nOther Democratic lawmakers also said they were displeased with the bill.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned that the President would consider advancing Trump-era immigration policies that Democrats fought so hard against \u2014 and that he himself campaigned against \u2014 in exchange for aid to our allies that Republicans already support,\u201d said Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif) and Rep. Nanette Barrag\u00e1n (D-Calif.), the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nImmigrant rights groups also slammed the legislation.\n\n\u201cAs [a] candidate, Joe Biden vowed to return to humane immigration policies, but as President, he has repeatedly pulled from former president Trump\u2019s playbook of cruelty,\u201d said Amy Fischer, the director of refugee and migrant rights for Amnesty International USA, in a statement."}

By torpedoing the Senate\u2019s bipartisan immigration deal, under pressure from former president Donald Trump to preserve his election-year advantage on a wedge issue, congressional Republicans would blow an opportunity to reduce undocumented immigration and curtail mass crossings at the southern border \u2014 along with save Ukraine before it runs out of ammunition. The 370-page legislative text released Sunday night, promptly declared \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in the House by Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), emerged from months of substantive discussions and careful compromises by all sides.\n\nSen. James Lankford (Okla.), the lead Republican negotiator, notes that about 1 million people who crossed the southern border over the past four months would have been deported, rather than released into the United States, if this agreement had been in place. Limitations on the president\u2019s power to grant humanitarian parole at land borders could stop more than half a million crossings annually, he says. There\u2019s even $650 million to build a border wall, the sort of funding Democrats forced a 35-day partial federal shutdown to prevent five years ago.\n\nDemocrats made concessions under pressure from public opinion: Fresh NBC polling shows Mr. Trump has a 35-point advantage over President Biden on immigration. But this window for dealmaking will close. Even if Republicans controlled the White House and Congress next year, the Senate filibuster would prevent them from having their way on the issue. Democrats will lose any incentive to deal if a president from their party no longer owns this problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis supplemental package would fund more than 4,300 new asylum officers and support staff, 100 additional immigration judge teams, 1,500 border patrol agents and customs officers, and 1,200 Immigration and Customs Enforcement staff to help with deportations. It would also provide detention capacity for 50,000 extra border crossers per year and more deportation flights. It would crack down on dubious asylum claims by raising the evidentiary standard for initiating an application. The bill would also empower asylum officers to rule on the merits of some applications earlier in the process.\n\nFaster processing times would deter migrants: It currently takes about five to seven years to get a final decision on an asylum claim. A majority of applications are ultimately rejected, but in the meantime, these immigrants put down roots that make it harder to remove them. Adjudicating asylum claims faster would change the calculus for those deciding whether to spend their savings to travel to the United States. If they think they\u2019ll get sent home after 90 days instead of 10 years, they\u2019ll be less likely to embark on the dangerous journey.\n\nFollow this author Editorial Board 's opinions Follow\n\nThe element of the agreement perhaps most misunderstood among Republicans is a Border Emergency Authority that would allow the president to turn away most asylum seekers if more than 5,000 people arrive daily, measured over the course of several days, which has been the case every week but one in the past four months. This goes further than the Title 42 authorities Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden invoked during the pandemic, restricting migrants who are turned away from reapplying for a year. Practically, this authority would end the migrant caravans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith all these tough provisions, it will be tempting for some progressives to cave to their left flank and oppose the compromise. They shouldn\u2019t. Democrats got several important sweeteners. The bill creates a new temporary visa to allow non-citizens to visit family in the United States, a pathway to citizenship for the children of H-1B visa holders and an additional 250,000 new family and work visas over the next five years \u2014 raising the cap for the first time in three decades. The Border Emergency Authority sunsets after three years. The bill would provide government-mandated lawyers for all unaccompanied migrants 13 years old and under to help them navigate the system and offers $350 million to pay for it. Instead of getting rid of humanitarian parole altogether, the president would still be able to use parole at airports.\n\nIn exchange for the crackdown at the border, the supplemental package would provide $60.6 billion to support Ukraine and $14.1 billion in security assistance for Israel. The House plans to vote this week on a standalone bill for Israel, but that version includes no humanitarian aid to help Palestinians in Gaza. This does."}

A hard-won, bipartisan Senate deal dropped Sunday evening, with tons of items on conservatives\u2019 border-policy bucket list, including many that former president Donald Trump had begged for. These include:\n\nbeefing up border security as a condition for giving any more aid to Ukraine (check!)\n\na tougher and faster asylum-processing system so that those who don\u2019t meet asylum criteria cannot stay and work for years while their cases crawl through the courts (check!)\n\nhiring more personnel for Customs and Border Protection as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (1,500 and 1,200, respectively \u2014 so, check, check!)\n\nhuge investments in fentanyl detection technologies and other anti-trafficking enforcement (check!)\n\nreviving something like Title 42 restrictions, wherein the president can \u201c shut down \u201d most of the asylum system (though this version doesn\u2019t require a public health pretext and has more severe consequences for border-crossers \u2014 so, check-plus, perhaps).\n\nHouse Republicans should have been pinching themselves in disbelief. Yet within hours of this 370-page bill dropping, House GOP leaders ruled out letting their chamber vote on any of it.\n\nFollow this author Catherine Rampell 's opinions Follow\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen enough,\u201d Speaker Mike Johnson (La.) said, later adding that it was \u201ca waste of time.\u201d He just can\u2019t take yes for an answer, it seems.\n\nThere are different ways to interpret why this much-awaited, much-desired legislation ended up, in Johnson\u2019s words, \u201cDEAD on arrival in the House.\" Perhaps his conference wants to maintain \u201cborder chaos\u201d as a live issue through the 2024 election. Trump, the party\u2019s likely presidential nominee, has said as much, since he hopes to continue running on the idea that he alone can fix it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe GOP lawmakers genuinely think they should hold out for the more draconian bill they put forward last year, known as H.R. 2. There are two major problems with this strategy: First, H.R. 2 would not supply funding for pretty much anything that could stop border crossings.\n\nSecond, it would almost certainly never become law \u2014 even if Republicans were to gain control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) himself has pointed this out. (For procedural reasons, the bill would need 60 votes, which it could not get.)\n\nMaybe House lawmakers are genuinely confused about how immigration law works. After all, they keep insisting that President Biden take actions that courts have ruled would be illegal. They also appear to misunderstand (misrepresent?) an aspect of the bipartisan Senate deal, in suggesting that it \u201caccepts 5,000 illegal immigrants a day.\u201d This is not, in fact, what the bill would do; rather, it would force the United States to block anyone crossing between ports of entry from even applying for asylum when that threshold has recently been met (as is the case right now).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe House Republicans have convinced themselves that any legislation that could appeal to Democrats must, ipso facto, be too reasonable for them to consider. In a twist on the Groucho Marx line, they\u2019d never belong to a club that would have anyone else as a member.\n\nHard-line Republicans had already begun efforts to punish their own party members who worked on this bipartisan deal, including lead GOP negotiator Sen. James Lankford(Okla.). Poor Lankford reportedly didn\u2019t want this job at all, but he caught the falling knife anyway \u2014 and then got stabbed in the back with it.\n\nMaybe House Republicans are pining for a replay of their failed efforts to repeal Obamacare in 2017. Back then, they demagogued for multiple campaign cycles on overhauling the U.S. health-care system. Then, when granted the power to do so, they realized they had no real solutions. Everything they\u2019d said on the issue was a meaningless posture, and they (fortunately) failed to pass anything at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike the Obamacare repeal debacle, the passage of the Senate border bill would not be so terrible. I maintain serious concerns about its Title 42-like powers, as well as some other provisions relating to asylum. But much of the bill would make useful changes that should, theoretically, receive robust bipartisan support.\n\nFor example, it would invest much-needed resources in the border. It would give our Afghan allies \u2014 people who\u2019ve already been vetted and are here in the United States but stuck in legal limbo \u2014 a pathway to permanent legal status. And for the first time, it would mandate that vulnerable, unaccompanied children seeking asylum receive legal counsel."}

Sure, there was low turnout, but Black voters were overrepresented among those who showed up, and they were determined to do so against any challenges.\n\nDemocrats in South Carolina, having helped catapult Biden to the nomination and the presidency in 2020, did their best to repeat the trick. He won a near-unanimous 96 percent of the vote in what was, after all, a contested primary. Challengers Marianne Williamson and Dean Phillips finished in rounding-error territory, with roughly 2 percent each. Some national polls have shown anemic enthusiasm for Biden\u2019s reelection within his own party, but voters here apparently did not get the memo.\n\nBlack voters cast roughly three-fourths of the early vote, according to the state Democratic Party, though they make up only about half of the state\u2019s Democratic electorate. Among the African Americans who waited until primary day to cast a ballot were the Rev. Mickey Joyner and his wife, Teresa. \u201cThe president deserves two terms to finish his work,\u201d Mickey Joyner said, standing outside of the Earlewood Park Community Center just north of downtown. \u201cHe\u2019s done a good job.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeresa Joyner said that \u201cwe don\u2019t even understand the reason for having a primary,\u201d given Biden\u2019s incumbency. She and her husband said they were determined, above all, to keep Donald Trump from regaining power. Trump \u201chas no respect for the law,\u201d in Mickey Joyner\u2019s words, and Teresa Joyner said the former president \u201creminds me of a 5- or 6-year-old.\u201d\n\nFollow this author Eugene Robinson 's opinions Follow\n\nJust figuring out where to vote was a challenge for some in the Columbia area: At the last minute, county and state election officials consolidated polling stations without making any meaningful effort to inform the public. Four precincts that normally voted elsewhere were assigned to the Earlewood site.\n\nAmong those who arrived at their regular polling place only to be disappointed was none other than Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison, a South Carolina native. He and the chair of the state party, Christale Spain, had arranged to meet reporters on Saturday morning at the site where Harrison always votes \u2014 on Arsenal Hill, across Lincoln Street from the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen they got there, the building was dark and empty. \u201cNow, why\u2019d they close my precinct?\u201d Harrison asked his aides, rhetorically. He said that by putting South Carolina first in its 2024 primary calendar, the Democratic Party is \u201cdelivering on its promise to Black voters,\u201d whom he described as \u201cthe backbone\u201d of the party.\n\nFour years ago, Biden\u2019s landslide victory here \u2014 sparked by an endorsement from the state\u2019s most influential Democratic official, Rep. James E. Clyburn \u2014 seemed to signal to African American voters across the country that it was time to get aboard the Biden train. That is the president\u2019s hope again this year.\n\nIt\u2019s worth paying attention to how people are casting a ballot when they\u2019re given the chance \u2014 and provided with alternatives they supposedly want. In a low-turnout primary that no one was compelled to be enthusiastic about, Black voters were more enthusiastic than others and made their choice clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Trump beat Nikki Haley in New Hampshire by 11 points, his victory was widely characterized with adjectives such as \u201cdominant.\u201d Biden did not even participate in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, which the national party saw as illegitimate, but still he beat Phillips by 44 points \u2014 as a write-in, no less. Yet this feat was dismissed as \u201cmeh.\u201d\n\nThere is no ironclad guarantee that Trump will win the primary in South Carolina at all, though polling has shown him well ahead. Haley can look at Saturday\u2019s turnout and hope that some Democrats stayed home so they can weaken Trump by voting for her in the GOP contest."}

The proposed 2017 concert on a private island in the Bahamas set a new bar for scams primarily because of the massive divergence between what was offered and what was delivered. Concertgoers were promised private flights to luxurious housing and gourmet food; they got commercial flights to wet mattresses and cheese sandwiches.\n\nWhat\u2019s obvious about the festival, though, is that the organizers\u2019 central mistake \u2014 beyond, you know, engaging in criminal fraud that landed the lead organizer in prison \u2014 was to keep taking the path of least resistance. It was easier to keep trying to pull something together as the concert date neared than it was to pull the plug; it was easier to hope that a miracle would occur than to admit that it wouldn\u2019t. It was the sort of bet that\u2019s made hundreds of times a day in Las Vegas, to the repeated benefit of the city\u2019s casinos.\n\nThere is a lesson here for House Republicans.\n\nBack in September, then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) announced that he was authorizing the leaders of several House committees to begin investigating whether President Biden should face impeachment. He offered several theoretical reasons that Biden might need to be sanctioned, reasons that House Republicans had already been trying to bolster for several months without luck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe month before his announcement, McCarthy himself had admitted that they needed to begin the process of impeaching Biden to figure out what impeachable offenses Biden might have committed. A month later, he was no longer speaker.\n\nThere has been no substantive progress since. Republicans like House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) began arguing even before Republicans took control of the chamber in January 2023 what he thought Biden had done. Over the following 12-plus months, he failed to generate any substantive evidence of it.\n\nInstead, the pattern displayed by House Republicans, and Comer in particular, is that investigators get concrete denials of involvement by Biden in his family\u2019s business efforts. Then they ignore those in favor of cherry-picked excerpts of testimony aimed at building a circumstantial, superficial case against the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis has become problematic for other Republicans in the House. Last week, CNN reported that GOP lawmakers are balking at the idea that they might be asked to impeach the president, given both the dearth of evidence and Comer\u2019s clumsy handling of the probe.\n\nOne told CNN, \u201cI don\u2019t think it goes anywhere.\u201d Another Republican source called it \u201ca jumbled mess.\u201d The Republican caucus has a tiny majority in the House but, according to one legislator who spoke to CNN, there may be as many as 20 Republicans who are unwilling to go along with the idea. Other voices on the right are also expressing skepticism.\n\nThe problem is that Comer and his allies have already been selling tickets to this festival. Polling conducted by Pew Research Center last month found that three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents support the impeachment inquiry (belatedly formalized in December). More than half of Americans do as well, largely because of that strong support from Republicans.\n\nFascinatingly, a majority of Republicans said that they believed Biden had \u201cdefinitely\u201d done things that warranted impeachment. Another third said that they thought he probably had. This is despite the failure of both the informal and formal probes to assemble evidence to that effect.\n\nWhy are Republicans so confident in Biden\u2019s culpability? Part of it is partisanship, obviously, just as part of the widespread Republican belief that Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory was illegitimate is rooted in partisan opposition to the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComer and his allies are selling something that Republicans are interested in buying. A first-class flight to see Biden impeached? Sure!\n\nShare this article Share\n\nBut then part of it is that House Republicans also have marketing partners. In Suffolk University-USA Today polling conducted last month, three-quarters of Republicans said they supported the impeachment inquiry. So did 85 percent of those who most trust Fox News as a news source.\n\nFox News hosts like Sean Hannity and Maria Bartiromo have been uncritical champions of the effort. Bartiromo has repeatedly hosted Comer for interviews in which his obviously false, debunked claims are left unchallenged.\n\nHannity has done the same, even following the one public impeachment inquiry \u2014 generally considered a debacle for Republicans \u2014 with a chance for the chairmen of the committees leading the inquiry to do a little cleanup. (The Fyre Festival also had mid-tier celebrity backers.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rewards at play here aren\u2019t only political. Comer has been fundraising on his newfound position, with success. In 2022, when he was on the ballot, he raised about $286,000 for his campaign committee in the quarter that ended on Sept. 30. In 2023, when he wasn\u2019t on the ballot but was on Fox News a lot, he pulled in more than $1.1 million that same quarter.\n\nOf course, the payoff he\u2019s been promising is political: that he will gin up evidence that takes down Biden. So far, he hasn\u2019t inspired confidence, offering up allegations about Biden taking money that were quickly shown to be family members of the president paying him back for money he lent them.\n\nLike the organizers of the Fyre Festival, Republicans seem to be taking the path of least resistance, hoping for that last-minute miracle. In the coming weeks, investigators will depose Biden\u2019s son Hunter and brother Jim, high-profile questioning that, they hope, might shake something loose. (Given Comer\u2019s track record, he\u2019ll presumably claim that it did regardless.)\n\nMaybe it will. Maybe, at the last minute, the whole thing will come together and everyone they invited and took money from will show up to see the event they were promised: Joe Biden held to account for his wrongdoing by House Republicans."}

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The proposal from the Justice Department\u2019s Office for Victims of Crime, a major overhaul to how states across the U.S. currently handle victims compensation claims, comes less than a year after an Associated Press investigation exposed that Black victims were disproportionately denied in many states \u2014 often for subjective reasons rooted in implicit biases that are felt across the criminal justice system.\n\nIf adopted, the changes would bar states from considering a victim\u2019s criminal history and eliminate some of the most subjective reasons for denials in many states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCertain populations may be more likely to have criminal history due to unjustified disparate treatment in the criminal justice system or due to criminal conduct induced through force, fraud, or coercion, such as unlawful acts that traffickers compelled their victims to commit, and this can result in unjustifiably disproportionate denial of claims for those populations,\u201d according to the proposal.\n\nThousands of Americans each year turn to the state-run victim compensation programs that provide financial assistance to victims of violent crime. The money is used to help with funeral expenses, physical and emotional therapy, lost wages, crime-scene cleanup and more.\n\nBut the AP found last year that in 19 out of the 23 states willing to provide racial data, Black victims were disproportionately denied compensation. In Indiana, Georgia and South Dakota, Black applicants were nearly twice as likely as white applicants to be denied. From 2018 through 2021, the denials added up to thousands of Black families each year collectively missing out on millions of dollars in aid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of people are denied compensation every year for often subjective reasons that scrutinize victims\u2019 behavior before or after a crime. The AP found that Black victims were nearly three times as likely to be denied for these reasons, including a category often called \u201ccontributory misconduct\u201d where programs sometimes, without evidence, accuse victims of causing or contributing to their own victimization.\n\nThe proposed changes would strictly limit when a state program can deny a person for misconduct including requiring that states put into law or policy what is specifically considered contributory conduct and the process they use to decide if it is being applied in a denial. The proposal also clarifies that state programs should not claw back money victims receive from crowdfunding sources such as GoFundMe among other changes.\n\nPamela White, whose son Dararius Evans was killed in 2019, was initially denied compensation by Louisiana\u2019s program because officials blamed her son for his own death. She received few details of how the state came to that conclusion and had to take out a personal loan to cover his funeral expenses while she appealed the decision. She eventually won.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite said Monday that she was happy to hear about the proposed rule changes from the federal government.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cWhy make things difficult when someone is already going through a hard time?\u201d White said. \u201cI\u2019m thankful that (the proposal) has happened because murders are still taking place. You know, parents are still going to have to bury their children.\u201d\n\nOver the last decade, several states have passed laws or made administrative regulation changes to limit some of the most subjective kinds of denials. Other states have passed laws expanding access to the funding or adding covered expenses.\n\nMany of those changes came after victims and advocates protested, testified and urged lawmakers to change the rules.\n\nLenore Anderson, president and co-founder of Alliance for Safety and Justice, which organizes victims to advocate for criminal justice reforms, praised the federal office and the proposed changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese proposed reforms are a long time coming. Too many victims across the country have faced extraordinary barriers trying to get help in times of crisis,\u201d she said, noting the proposals align with criticisms advocates have been hearing from victims for decades. \u201cThe Office for Victims of Crime is really focused on expanding victim access. They are really focused on securing fair access to help that is desperately needed in times of crisis. This is thoughtful rulemaking that should be applauded.\u201d\n\nAnderson and other advocates have pushed for federal rule changes that would require state programs to all adhere to a victim-centered approach to considering claims. The proposals would do that in several areas including the bar on considering previous criminal histories and removing administrative hurdles like barring most requirements for notarized portions of applications.\n\nMany of the items in the proposal Monday give states more room to expand services and approve claims. The proposal would allow states to apply a broader definition to medical or mental health expenses to allow people in rural areas with fewer licensed providers to find care or to allow for Native American healing practices to be covered expenses. The proposal would allow for a broader definition of who would be eligible to include people beyond a close familial relationship to a victim and allow for states to create broader definitions of allowable property damage expenses that contribute to victim safety."}

But it doesn\u2019t appear to be a red line for them \u2014 at least not yet.\n\nThe CNN poll asked about things Trump could attempt, some of which he\u2019s spoken openly about. At least 7 in 10 Americans believe he would do each of these things:\n\nFire federal workers who oppose his policies (82 percent).\n\nTry to pardon himself (78 percent).\n\nPardon most Jan. 6 defendants (77 percent).\n\nDirect his Justice Department to investigate his political rivals (74 percent).\n\nHelpfully, the poll then asked whether people would actually favor Trump doing these things. In each case, about 7 in 10 Americans also opposed him doing them. Opposition ranges from 66 percent for firing federal workers to 72 percent for giving himself a pardon.\n\nSo roughly 7 in 10 Americans are convinced Trump will do rather drastic things that 7 in 10 Americans oppose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gaps are even more pronounced if you zero in on independents. For instance:\n\nShare this article Share\n\n76 percent of independents think Trump will direct the Justice Department to investigate his political rivals, and 73 percent say they would oppose that.\n\n76 percent think Trump will try to pardon himself, and 77 percent oppose that.\n\n75 percent think he\u2019ll pardon most Jan. 6 defendants, and 71 percent oppose him doing that.\n\nThe poll also shows 77 percent of independents think Trump will try to repeal Obamacare, and 65 percent of them oppose that. Seventy-seven percent think Trump wouldn\u2019t concede a loss in the 2024 election after the results are certified, even as 85 percent say a candidate has an obligation to do so. (This is the very situation that led to Jan. 6.)\n\nSo how do these same independents plan to vote? Trump led Biden among them, 46 percent to 42 percent in the poll.\n\nCertainly, the fact that Trump is showing slight leads in this and other polling owes in large part to Biden\u2019s own problems. Biden\u2019s approval (38 percent) and favorable (34 percent) ratings are at or near low points. As many as 7 in 10 doubt that he has the mental sharpness to perform his duties as president. As many as three-quarters say he\u2019s simply too old to serve, and they have generally regarded his age as much more of an issue than Trump\u2019s, despite less than a four-year difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps when given a choice between too old and too extreme, Americans might favor the latter. Polarization certainly plays a role.\n\nWhat these data suggest, though, is that these are some valid and potentially potent issues for Democrats to plumb. Even more than 4 in 10 Republicans say they don\u2019t want Trump to go there on pardons or to sic the Justice Department on his rivals.\n\nOne way to look at the data is that Americans already know about these extreme proposals \u2014 many of which Trump has publicly floated \u2014 and don\u2019t care enough. But another is that they are inclined to believe that Trump would actually try to govern in these more authoritarian ways, and the trick for Democrats is to drive home how extreme a second Trump term could be once people start more earnestly sizing up Trump\u2019s candidacy."}

Such a cyclone, with sustained winds of at least 157 mph, could flatten any structure of the era, so there was no reason to give the most ferocious tier of hurricanes an upper bound.\n\nBut as the planet warms, storms are increasingly surpassing what was once considered extreme, according to research published Monday. Now, two scientists are proposing a new label they say a growing number of storms already merit: Category 6.\n\n\u201cClimate change has demonstrably made the strongest storms stronger,\u201d said Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \u201cIntroduction of this hypothetical Category 6 would raise awareness of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWehner and James Kossin, a distinguished science adviser at the First Street Foundation, suggest the Category 6 label could go to any tropical cyclone with sustained winds of at least 192 mph \u2014 an intensity that five storms have surpassed since 2013.\n\nMeteorologists have for years debated whether the current hurricane scale adequately captures the hazards of today\u2019s storms \u2014 it only takes winds into account, not pounding waves or flooding \u2014 and whether a new top-end category is needed. With the new research, the scientists say they are formalizing that discussion, in hopes of spurring more academic debate about the ways climate change is heightening weather hazards as we know them.\n\n\u201cHaving [Category 5] mean anything above a certain threshold is becoming more and more problematic,\u201d Kossin said. \u201cIt tends to understate the risk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no sign that government hurricane forecasters will revise their rating scale anytime soon \u2014 and some meteorologists disagree on whether it should be adopted. Still, the proposal underscores how dramatically the potential for extreme storms has surged.\n\nAs global temperatures rise, oceanic and atmospheric warming are more often creating a prime environment for storms to rapidly strengthen and swirl more forcefully than ever.\n\nThe scientists predict the trend will only accelerate in warm basins such as the Gulf of Mexico, where some sea surface temperature readings surpassed 100 degrees amid record global warmth last summer. Scientists forecast the threat will worsen once planetary temperatures average 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. In that scenario, they say the risk of Category 6 storms in the Gulf will double.\n\nClimate change is intensifying hurricanes\n\nThe research adds to a growing body of understanding \u2014 and proof \u2014 that global warming translates to stronger storms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter all, warmer air holds more moisture. And more heat means more energy for storms to feed on and violently unleash. Tropical cyclones effectively serve to even out clashes between high and low pressure and hot and cool temperatures, returning the meteorological environment to equilibrium.\n\nGlobal warming has already translated to increasing odds of major hurricanes around the world, according to research Kossin led that was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2020. Other studies have found that as temperatures rise, more hurricanes are undergoing what meteorologists call rapid intensification, and they are doing so at accelerating rates.\n\nKossin and Wehner\u2019s latest paper adds more detail and scientific rigor to our understanding of what climate change means for the most intense hurricanes.\n\nThey scrutinized observations of past storms to find that five stand as outliers relative to past Category 5 storms: Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Hurricane Patricia in 2015, Typhoon Meranti in 2016, Typhoon Goni in 2020 and Typhoon Surigae in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaiyan killed thousands across the Philippines, stunning meteorologists with its record intensity. Two years later, Patricia became even stronger, with maximum sustained winds of 215 mph, though it weakened before making landfall in Mexico.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThey analyzed how often conditions could be ripe for such extreme storms to develop. They found that near the Philippines, risks of a Category 6 storm would rise by 50 percent once global warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and would double at 4 degrees of warming. In the Gulf, the risks would triple if warming reaches 4 degrees above preindustrial levels.\n\nAnd they used climate models to forecast how often Category 6 storms might form in the future and to be sure the trend is tied to climate change and not natural variability. They found that annual chances of a Category 6 forming somewhere on the planet would climb to 2 percent at 1.5 degrees of global warming, 7 percent at 2 degrees of warming and 10 percent at 3 degrees of warming.\n\nSome worry a new category could backfire\n\nThough there might be a scientific basis for the idea of a Category 6 storm, not all meteorologists will support adopting it. After all, a Category 5 storm causes \u201ccatastrophic\u201d damage that could make an area \u201cuninhabitable for weeks or months,\u201d according to the National Hurricane Center\u2019s description.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to envision the need to convey a threat beyond this, even if a hypothetical tropical cyclone had peak winds that would constitute a category 6 (however one defines this),\u201d Michael Fischer, an assistant scientist at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Lab, said in an email.\n\nAnd there is a risk that the Category 6 designation could backfire, he added.\n\n\u201cIf a category 6 were established, would that diminish the threat of a category 5 storm, since that is no longer the most severe rating?\u201d Fischer added.\n\nEven without introduction of a Category 6, the Saffir-Simpson scale already faces criticism for only considering wind speeds and not dangers from storm surge, flooding or tornadoes. To qualify as hurricanes, tropical cyclones must have sustained winds of at least 74 mph; \u201cmajor\u201d hurricanes have winds of at least 111 mph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Hurricane Center will soon test a new version of its widely used forecast cone that is intended to communicate that a storm\u2019s wind hazards extend far from the spot at which its eye is predicted to make landfall.\n\nBut National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research shows such water-related hazards are hurricanes\u2019 deadliest threats, said Deirdre Byrne, a NOAA oceanographer who studies ocean heat and its role in hurricane intensification. While adding a Category 6 \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem inappropriate,\u201d she said, combining the Saffir-Simpson scale with something like an A through E rating for inundation threats might have a greater impact.\n\n\u201cThat might save even more lives,\u201d Byrne said.\n\nIn a statement, National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan seconded those concerns. He said NOAA forecasters have \u201ctried to steer the focus toward the individual hazards,\u201d including storm surge, flooding rains and dangerous rip currents, rather than overemphasizing the storm category, and, by extension, the wind threats alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that there would be a need for another category even if storms were to get stronger,\u201d he said.\n\nBringing the Saffir-Simpson scale into the future\n\nKossin and Wehner said their research doesn\u2019t mean to suggest that Category 6 should be added to the Saffir-Simpson scale. That is a decision that would require social science research into how it might affect people\u2019s risk perceptions and their actions to prepare for tropical cyclones, they said.\n\nInstead, they said their intention is to convey just how dramatically global warming has changed the environment for hurricanes. The scientists said they hope the discussion raises urgency to better equip coastal communities for new and changing weather extremes."}

The mother of a Virginia 6-year-old who shot his teacher was sentenced to two years in prison for felony child neglect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe parents of the Oxford, Mich., school shooter are facing the most serious charges yet. James and Jennifer Crumbley each face four counts of involuntary manslaughter, making them the first parents of a school shooter to face such serious charges. If convicted, they face up to 15 years in prison. Jury deliberations began Monday.\n\nThe Crumbleys\u2019 son, Ethan, was sentenced in December to life in prison for the murders of Hana St. Juliana, 14; Tate Myre, 16, Madisyn Baldwin, 17; and Justin Shilling, 17, at the high school about 40 miles north of Detroit. Prosecutors agree the parents did not know about their son\u2019s plan, but they argue the parents\u2019 actions make them responsible: They bought their son a gun four days before the shooting, allegedly failed to secure it properly and had ample warning signs that he could pose a threat to others.\n\nThe parents are facing identical charges in separate trials, with Jennifer Crumbley going first. The shooter\u2019s access to a 9mm Sig Sauer semiautomatic pistol has been a key point throughout her trial.\n\nDeliberations began on Feb. 5 for the trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the Oxford, Mich., teen who shot and killed four students on November 30, 2021. (Video: Joy Yi/The Washington Post, Photo: Bill Pugliano/Getty Images/The Washington Post)\n\nSchool shooting data indicates that family members storing guns securely would curb the flow of weapons in a majority of school shootings perpetrated by children, who, unlike adult shooters, cannot legally buy firearms. The Washington Post reviewed more than 180 shootings committed by juveniles since the Columbine massacre in 1999 and found in cases where the source of the gun could be determined that the weapons were found in the homes of friends, relatives or parents 86 percent of the time.\n\nOakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald in her closing arguments stressed that Jennifer Crumbley\u2019s case was rare but had to be brought because of the \u201cfacts.\u201d Defense attorney Shannon Smith argued that the case was \u201cdangerous\u201d to parents and asked the jury to find Crumbley not guilty \u201cfor every parent doing the best they can, who could easily be in [her] shoes.\u201d\n\nThat the Crumbleys are being prosecuted may shape perceptions of how the public thinks about parental culpability when their children independently take deadly action. But on the continuum of problematic parenting, there\u2019s no clear agreement on when it crosses the line into criminal negligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExtending liability to parents for the criminal acts of their children will in the future fall hardest on parents who are poor, people of color or from marginalized groups, predicts Evan Bernick, a law professor at Northern Illinois University College of Law.\n\nBernick said the desire to prosecute the Crumbleys is understandable \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a set of appalling facts that cry out for justice\u201d \u2014 but noted the legal maxim that \u201chard cases make bad law.\u201d\n\nExtraordinary as the facts in the Crumbley case might be, the public has to consider not just this case but others in the future \u2014 \u201ccases that won\u2019t get the public\u2019s attention, that may look different, and where the same amount of scrutiny won\u2019t be applied,\u201d Bernick said.\n\nRandy Zelin, a criminal defense attorney who teaches at Cornell Law School, is sympathetic to the desire to want to hold parents accountable yet wary of prosecuting such cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe law is not supposed to be emotional,\u201d Zelin said, \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be neutral and detached.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been a growing reassessment of how people think about the different actors who play a role in a shooting, said Erin Davis, who directs litigation at the Brady Campaign & Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Brady is representing the family of Elijah Mueller, an Oxford student wounded in the shooting, in a lawsuit against the gun shop that sold James Crumbley the firearm and entities of Oxford Community Schools.\n\nFrameworks for accountability have already become common in civil cases, like the landmark $73 million settlement between the families of Sandy Hook victims and Remington Arms, but are now are becoming criminal matters, according to Davis.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing about the prosecution and lawsuit is the message that somebody helped put that gun in a child\u2019s hands,\u201d Davis said.\n\nHow much burden parents bear\n\nProsecutors must convince jurors that the Crumbley parents knew there was a dangerous situation brewing with their son, yet gave him a gun and failed to demonstrate the \u201cordinary care\u201d that could have avoided harm. Prosecutors are not suggesting parents are responsible for everything their children do but are arguing the Crumbleys are outliers and that their actions made for uniquely criminal circumstances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe facts are what set the Crumbley case apart to Jessica Roth, a professor at Cardozo Law School at Yeshiva University who specializes in evidence and criminal law. Roth thinks prosecutions of parents will remain rare, and will happen only if they meet the threshold that the parents were aware of a strong risk of their child carrying out a shooting \u2014 and willfully disregarding the warning signs.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cIt would be oversimplifying the case to say that these are parents who\u2019ve been charged with manslaughter based on their son committing a school shooting \u2014 and leave out the critical distinct facts about this particular case,\u201d said Roth. \u201cThe details just make it seem that there was a callous disregard for the danger or possible danger.\u201d\n\nMuch of the evidence against the Crumbleys already emerged during their son\u2019s sentencing; Jennifer Crumbley\u2019s trial is the first time the public heard her explain in her own voice some of the decisions she made in the hours, months and days before the shooting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her closing argument, McDonald said the shooter\u2019s actions were foreseeable by his mother.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t give him the help he wanted,\u201d McDonald said.\n\nSmith, the defense attorney, said the crime was unthinkable \u201cbecause it was unforeseeable.\u201d\n\nProsecutors depicted Jennifer Crumbley as a selfish, distant parent who rarely spoke of her son to others. When she did, she described him as \u201cweird\u201d and speculated he might be depressed after losing his paternal grandmother and the family dog and his only friend moved away in the months leading up to the shooting. When Crumbley and her husband had opportunities to tell the school he had recently been at a shooting range and handled a gun, they said nothing. Instead of helping their son, prosecutors said, they gave him a gun \u2014 and then fled from authorities after they learned they were facing charges, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith said Crumbley was a loving, \u201chypervigilant\u201d mother who never had reason to believe her son was a troublemaker or a danger. He hid the depths of his mental health struggles from his mother, instead pouring them into journal entries and text messages with his only friend, Smith told jurors. After her son was identified as the shooter, Crumbley testified, the Crumbleys planned to surrender but first had to go into hiding amid a wave of death threats.\n\nMissed signs\n\nEight months before the shooting, Crumbley\u2019s son texted that he could see demons or clothes flying from shelves and asked his mother to respond to him. This was Crumbley\u2019s chance to get her troubled son help, prosecutors said. Crumbley testified that she took the messages as her son\u2019s offbeat sense of humor that played on a running joke about their family\u2019s house being haunted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the months before the shooting suggested the shooter was experiencing mental health issues, prosecutors said, the days before the shooting clearly showed repeated examples of grossly negligent behavior.\n\nFour days before the shooting, James Crumbley bought a handgun for his son as an early Christmas present; Jennifer later took him to a shooting range to practice. Guns were her husband\u2019s realm, Crumbley testified, and she said she trusted him to handle storing the weapon properly.\n\nThe day before the shooting, Jennifer received a voice mail from school alerting her that her son had been perusing information on ammunition in class. Crumbley didn\u2019t call the school back but texted her son that he had to learn to \u201cnot get caught.\u201d Crumbley testified that this was another instance of the family\u2019s quirky humor and a callback to her own troublemaking youth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Crumbleys were alarmed, however, the morning of the shooting, after they were summoned to school to discuss images their son drew on a math quiz: a black gun that looked like the one they had bought him, a bullet, a bleeding, gunshot-riddled figure and phrases like \u201cThe thoughts won\u2019t stop. Help me\u201d and \u201cThe world is dead.\u201d\n\nThe takeaway to Crumbley\u2019s parents was that he was depressed; his counselor thought he showed signs of suicidal ideation. Neither they nor the school dean thought he was a risk to others.\n\nThe counselor testified he didn\u2019t want the teen left alone but was surprised when the teen\u2019s parents didn\u2019t offer to take him home. The Crumbleys said they had to return to work, while their son asked to go back to class. The parents did not tell school officials of the recently bought gun or the trip to the shooting range.\n\nBut the gun was sitting in the shooter\u2019s backpack the entire meeting. Neither the parents nor the school staff searched it before he was sent back to class."}

Police have arrested seven people in connection with the attack, though prosecutors dropped charges against one person they say may not have been involved.\n\nNobody was seriously hurt, but the video of officers being pummeled has prompted waves of public outrage. Some of that fury has been directed at prosecutors and the court system after several of those arrested were freed from jail while awaiting trial.\n\nIncreasingly, New York City officials have aimed dire rhetoric at the tens of thousands of asylum seekers the city has put up in shelters and hotels over the past year. Some of the comments have dismayed immigration advocates, who say they are stirring up hatred over the actions of a few bad apples.\n\n\u201cA wave of migrant crime has washed over our city,\u201d Police Commissioner Edward Caban said at a news conference Monday about a Venezuelan man being sought in a series of cell phone robberies. He likened the suspect\u2019s accomplices to \u201dghost criminals,\u201d claiming they had come to New York \u201cwith no criminal history, no photos, no social media.\u201d\n\nThe NYPD released a video showing Mayor Eric Adams joining officers as they raided a Bronx apartment building in connection with that investigation Monday morning. The video included ominous music and an officer warning of \u201cmigrants preying on vulnerable New Yorkers,\u201d while footage plays of a woman being dragged behind a scooter during a purse-snatching.\n\nPressed for details to back up the claim of a crime wave, however, police and city officials said they couldn\u2019t provide them because the city doesn\u2019t track crime trends by the nationality of suspects.\n\nMost categories of crime are down since a surge of migrant arrivals began 18 months ago.\n\nAlexa Avil\u00e9s, the head of the City Council\u2019s committee on immigration, accused the mayor and the NYPD of playing into \u201cthe same old Trumpian fear mongering and the systematic scapegoating of a diverse and vulnerable group of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought \u2018crime was down?\u2019\u201d Avil\u00e9s added. \u201cWhere is the evidence to support these claims?\u201d\n\nIn press appearances Monday, Adams noted the vast majority of the nearly 175,000 migrants who have come to the city are law abiding. He said it would be wrong for \u201cany New Yorker to look at people trying to fulfill the next step on the American Dream as criminal.\u201d\n\nBut in recent days, Adams has also shown a willingness to pull back on a set of laws that often block the city from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nDescribing the Times Square incident as \u201can attack on the foundation of our symbol of safety,\u201d Adams, a moderate Democrat and former police captain, called on the City Council to consider \u201cif there should be more collaboration\u201d with federal immigration officials. He did not elaborate.\n\nSince 2014, the police department and city jails have been barred from holding people in custody on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement unless they have been convicted of certain violent crimes and a judge has issued a warrant for their removal.\n\nFederal immigration authorities don\u2019t have a presence in the city\u2019s jail system. City resources aren\u2019t supposed to be used to assist in the detention and deportation process.\n\nExperts said it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what role, if any, the city\u2019s so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d policies may have had in the cases of the men accused of assaulting officers in Times Square.\n\nAn ICE spokesperson did not respond to an emailed question about whether they were seeking to detain the individuals involved in the brawl.\n\nThough police officials have expressed outrage that five of the six suspects arrested were released, the city\u2019s immigration policies have no bearing on the decisions of prosecutors and judges who set bail.\n\nResponding to public criticism, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has said his office was still working to ensure that all the men were correctly identified. One of the men arrested was not prosecuted because of insufficient evidence of his involvement, a spokesperson for Bragg said.\n\nHe said additional people involved in the attack would likely be arrested in coming days. Prosecutors are to present evidence to a grand jury starting Tuesday.\n\nProponents of the city\u2019s sanctuary laws say they bolster public safety by ensuring immigrant communities are not afraid of interacting with the legal system \u2013 not only as criminal defendants, but as witnesses or potential victims of crimes.\n\nA decade ago, New York City held up to 3,000 people in custody each year for the purpose of helping federal immigration authorities initiate detention and deportation proceedings. In some cases, immigration attorneys said, police would proactively alert federal authorities immediately after making an arrest \u2013 long before a conviction was secured.\n\nAt a news conference Monday alongside conservative elected officials, Kenneth Genalo, the field office director in New York for ICE, said the city\u2019s lack of cooperation had made it harder to deport criminals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re no longer contacted,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are hundreds of people being arrested throughout the city, and if we can\u2019t determine which ones are the most violent, we have to find out unfortunately through the media.\u201d\n\nMurad Awawheh, the executive director of the Immigration Coalition, warned that the mayor\u2019s comments about rolling back sanctuary protections could have a chilling effect among the city\u2019s more than half-million undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cWhy are they fanning the flames now?\u201d Awawdeh said. \u201cIt seems he\u2019s trying to get people to look away from the bigger issues, which is his lack of management of the city at the moment.\u201d"}

We look forward to working with our fellow Ivy League athletes to bring positive change to the landscape of college sports and the Ivy League.\u201d\n\nThe NCAA and universities across the country have been steadfast in insisting their athletes are students, not employees. College sports leaders have even lobbied Congress for a federal law that would codify that classification as the NCAA faces a federal lawsuit in Pennsylvania on the subject.\n\nThe Service Employees International Union petitioned the labor board on behalf of the Dartmouth players last year. SEIU international president Mary Kay Henry said they remain in full support of the unionization effort.\n\n\u201cThis is an historic step forward for economic justice, racial justice, and union rights \u2014 not just for college athletes but for millions of young people across our country whose work is not valued like it should be,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe case is being closely watched, coming at a time when the NCAA\u2019s bedrock amateur athlete model is facing multiple challenges in court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first step to potential employee status for college athletes,\u201d said Gabe Feldman, a sports law professor at Tulane.\n\nThe school can still appeal the regional director\u2019s decision to the national board, which is what happened when members of the Northwestern football team held a union election in 2014.\n\nIn that case, the ballots were impounded pending a ruling. Now, an election can be held and ballots counted while an appeal is pending. The Northwestern ballots were destroyed after the NLRB, which only governs private employers, decided that allowing the football players at the only private school in the Big Ten would skew the labor market in the conference.\n\nIn that case, the NLRB did not address the question of whether the players were employees. All eight Ivy League schools are private and do not grant athletic scholarships. Feldman said that could increase the likelihood the full board will uphold the ruling.\n\n\u201cBut on the flip side, if Dartmouth men\u2019s basketball players are employees, not only what athletes are not employees, but does this make the music students employees?\u201d Feldman said. \u201cSo this may open the door too far?\u201d\n\nThere is a complaint before a different NLRB body in California that claims football and basketball players at Southern California should be deemed employees of the school, the Pac-12 Conference in which they play and the NCAA. That hearing resumes later this month.\n\nIn a 2021 memo, the NLRB\u2019s top lawyer said college athletes should be considered employees.\n\n\u201cThe freedom to engage in far-reaching and lucrative business enterprises makes players at academic institutions much more similar to professional athletes who are employed by a team to play a sport,\u201d NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo wrote.\n\nDuring a four-day hearing in October, Dartmouth argued that the players shouldn\u2019t be considered employees because athletics are part of the academic mission of the school, like performing in the orchestra or even playing club sports.\n\n\u201cAt Dartmouth, students\u2019 primary objective is learning,\u201d school attorney Joe McConnell said then. \u201cDartmouth has adopted policies reflecting that students who participate in intercollegiate athletics are students first and athletes second.\u201d\n\nThe college also said the men\u2019s basketball program loses money. Attorneys for the players countered that the school\u2019s numbers leave out important and lucrative revenue streams that the basketball team contributes to. What\u2019s more, the players say it\u2019s not whether the team turned a profit: What matters is if the program brings in revenue, and also whether coaches have control over the players.\n\nThe collegiate sports model based on amateurism is facing numerous legal and political threats, along with the NLRB ruling. The NCAA is facing at least six antitrust lawsuits, including one brought last week by attorneys general from Tennessee and Virginia that challenges how recruits can be compensated for name, image and likeness.\n\nThe model has been crumbling, most significantly after a 2021 Supreme Court ruling that opened college sports up to additional \u2014 though still limited \u2014 kinds of pay. In response, the NCAA loosened rules to permitted players to profit from their celebrity.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re all different sides to a similar threat,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cAnd the threat is the loss of control over the ability to restrict compensation to athletes. And we are closer than we\u2019ve ever been to a system where college athletes not only receive significant additional compensation, but also have a vote in how much compensation they receive.\u201d\n\nMajor League Baseball Players Association executive director Tony Clark said in a statement that the ruling shows \u201ccollege athletes are employees, entitled to basic rights and fair compensation for their labor that has created a multibillion-dollar industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s landmark NLRB ruling will improve the lives of all college athletes for generations to come,\u201d Clark\u2019s statement said. \u201cIn the history of the sports labor movement, change has always been initiated by the courageous efforts of Players who decided to stand up and demand their fair share.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball"}

He was shot dead in his studio in front of stunned aides, one of whom wept in court Monday as she recounted the attack.\n\nMullgrav said Jam Master Jay, born Jason Mizell, approached him periodically to sell cocaine that the rap star had acquired \u2014 \u201cmaybe 1 or 2 kilos, here or there.\u201d\n\n\u201cJason wasn\u2019t a drug dealer. He just used it to make ends meet,\u201d Mullgrav told jurors.\n\nThe defendants \u2014 Mizell\u2019s godson, Karl Jordan Jr., and the DJ\u2019s childhood friend Ronald Washington \u2014 have pleaded not guilty to murder in a case that has offered answers to the long-unsolved loss of a hip-hop legend while airing questions about how his life went once the limelight dimmed.\n\nWhile Run-DMC helped rap gain mainstream popularity in the 1980s as the first rap group to notch gold and platinum albums and have a video in rotation on MTV, it also distanced itself from drugs.\n\nThe trio delivered the message in rap with the 1987 hit \u201cIt\u2019s Tricky,\u201d with lyrics including: People \u201coffer coke, and lots of dope, but we just leave it alone.\u201d They even recorded an anti-drug public service announcement.\n\nBut at the trial, prosecutors and some witnesses have depicted a rap star who became a cocaine middleman as his career slowed and money ran short. Speculation that he was killed over a drug dispute circulated in chatter and media reports for decades, but so did other theories. Mizell\u2019s family insisted he didn\u2019t deal narcotics.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said Mizell was arranging a lucrative cocaine transaction when he was killed. They say Jordan and Washington were going to be cut out because a dealer \u2014 now identified as Mullgrav \u2014 refused to work with Washington.\n\nMullgrav told jurors that Mizell approached him in August 2002, saying he had a line on 10 or so kilograms of cocaine and \u201casking me to move it for him\u201d in Baltimore. Mullgrav lived there at the time and acknowleged he oversaw a cocaine-distribution ring with about 25 workers.\n\n\u201cHe wanted me to work with Tinard. I told him no,\u201d Mullgrav said, using Washington\u2019s nickname. They knew each other from growing up, and Mullgrav told jurors he disliked Washington enough to want to shoot him when he appeared in Baltimore around that time.\n\nMullgrav spent 12 years in federal prison on a drug-related conviction before his 2013 release. He testified only after being arrested on a material witness warrant \u2014 a procedure that can be used to compel court appearances \u2014 and spending seven days behind bars, said Gary Farrell, an attorney who was appointed to represent him.\n\nMullgrav had balked at testifying Friday, and he was laconic in court Monday.\n\nProsecutors and witness Uriel Rincon, a Mizell assistant who was shot alongside him, have said that Jordan shot Mizell while Washington brandished a gun and blocked the door.\n\nA second eyewitness, Lydia High, also testified Monday that Washington was at the doorway and commanded her at gunpoint to lie on the floor.\n\nHigh, then JMJ Records\u2019 business manager, told jurors that she was looking down at some paperwork when someone walked into the studio and approached Mizell on the evening of Oct. 30, 2002. She didn\u2019t identify the person, but described some attributes that roughly fit Jordan, including a tattooed neck.\n\nThe DJ gave the visitor a friendly greeting. But then he let out an expletive, his expression changed and gunshots erupted, High said, struggling to put the experience into words.\n\n\u201cI was \u2014 I was \u2014 I was frantic and shocked,\u201d she said through tears. She recalled running for the door, where she said Washington \u2014 whom she knew from her childhood block \u2014 ordered her to the floor.\n\nWhen asked about Mizell\u2019s condition, she paused and looked downward, crying, before prosecutor Artie McConnell withdrew the question.\n\nWhile cross-examining High, defense lawyers emphasized that she initially didn\u2019t tell investigators about Washington, nor about a gunman with a neck tattoo.\n\n\u201cI was afraid for my life.

The actual All-Star Game itself on Feb. 18 will remain on a wooden court.\n\n\u201cIt gives us a little bit more range in what we can do as far as interactive graphics, reactionary graphics that happen on the floor, changing the floor design, changing the colors, really reacting to the play that happens on the court,\u201d said Carlton Myers, an NBA senior vice president overseeing live production and entertainment. \u201cSo, we feel really, really good about the capabilities of what this gives us, what this provides us. And we think it\u2019s going to be really impactful, both in the building and watching on television.\u201d\n\nThe court, developed by the German company ASB GlassFloor, has been used in events by FIBA, the sport\u2019s governing body. FIBA approved usage of LED glass flooring at top-tier competitions in 2022. The league didn\u2019t reveal what the court costs, other than it\u2019s more expensive than a wood surface.\n\nThe NBA has been considering ways to use the product for some time. Andre Iguodala of the National Basketball Players Association and Joe Dumars, the NBA\u2019s executive vice president for basketball operations, experimented on the court last week to check how it plays and whether it\u2019s safe.\n\nThe court itself is actually two layers of laminated safety glass, each five millimeters thick, the NBA said. The surface is opaque, and all the designs will be provided by the LED panels. Courts will have a different look for each event \u2014 and part of what\u2019ll be displayed are real-time game stats, replays, video content and even player tracking animations.\n\nThe surface plays almost exactly the same way wood does, in terms of bounce and feel.\n\n\u201cWhat does it feel like? Does it have traction? Does it have give? Those were the questions that came to mind right away when you hear about this court,\u201d Dumars said. \u201cAnd they were answered to our satisfaction.\u201d\n\nThe NBA experimented with court design changes earlier this season, when it used different-looking surfaces for the In-Season Tournament. Those courts were still the traditional wood, just with a different paint scheme.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA"}

Bush who has ruled against other gun control measures in the past.\n\nMonday's decision was issued by U.S. Circuit Judges Richard Clifton and Holly Thomas, both appointees of Democratic presidents. U.S. Circuit Judge Consuelo Callahan, another Bush appointee, dissented, saying the state had not shown a likelihood of success on appeal.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, in a post on the social media platform X said the ruling meant that the state's \"life-saving ammunition laws will remain in effect as we continue to defend them in court.\"\n\nPlaintiffs challenging the law in court included Kim Rhode, who has won three Olympic gold medals in shooting events, and the California Rifle & Pistol Association.\n\nChuck Michel, the group's president and general counsel, in a statement said it will seek further review by a different panel of the court and \"restore the people's right to buy the ammunition they need for sport or to defend their families.\"\n\nCalifornia voters had in 2016 approved a ballot measure requiring gun owners to undergo initial background checks to buy ammunition, and pay $50 for a four-year ammunition permit.\n\nLegislators amended the measure to require background checks for each ammunition purchase, starting in 2019.\n\nBenitez's Jan. 30 ruling was the latest court decision declaring a gun restriction unconstitutional following the conservative-majority Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen.\n\nThat ruling recognized for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to carry a handgun in public for self-defense. It also established a new test for assessing firearms laws, saying restrictions must be \"consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.\"\n\nBenitez in his decision rejected California's reliance on dozens of laws dating back to 1789 as \"historical analogues\" for ammunition checks and said the law had \"no historical pedigree.\"\n\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; editing by Miral Fahmy)"}

The Pentagon has said it does not want war with Iran and does not believe Tehran wants war either.\n\nSullivan declined to be drawn on whether the United States might attack sites inside Iran, something the U.S. military has been very careful to avoid.\n\nSpeaking to CBS' \"Face the Nation\" program moments earlier, he said Friday's strikes were \"the beginning, not the end, of our response, and there will be more steps - some seen, some perhaps unseen\".\n\n\"I would not describe it as some open-ended military campaign,\" he said.\n\nSaturday's strikes in Yemen hit buried weapons storage facilities, missile systems, launchers and other capabilities the Houthis have used to attack Red Sea shipping, the Pentagon said, adding it targeted 13 locations.\n\nThe Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said the strikes \"will not pass without a response and consequences\".\n\nAnother Houthi spokesperson, Mohammed Abdulsalam, indicated the group would not be deterred, saying Yemen's decision to support Gaza would not be affected by any attack.\n\nResidents described being shaken by powerful blasts. \"The building I live in shook,\" said Fatimah, a resident of Houthi-controlled Sanaa, adding that it had been years since she had felt such blasts in a country that has suffered years of war.\n\nThe Houthis did not announce any casualties.\n\nSecretary of State Blinken will visit Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Israel in the coming days on his fifth trip to the region since October, which will focus on advancing talks on the return of hostages taken from Israel by Hamas in exchange for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nHe will also make a push on a U.S.-brokered mega deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel to normalize ties, which hinges on bringing an end to other Gaza conflict and steps toward a future Palestinian state.\n\nIRAN SEEN AVOIDING DIRECT CONFRONTATION\n\nThe Yemen strikes are running parallel to the unfolding U.S. campaign of retaliation over the killing of three American soldiers in a drone strike by Iran-backed militants on an outpost in Jordan.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. carried out the first wave of that retaliation, striking in Iraq and Syria more than 85 targets linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and militias it backs, reportedly killing nearly 40.\n\nMahjoob Zweiri, Director of the Gulf Studies Center at Qatar University, did not expect a change in Iran's approach even after the latest U.S. strikes.\n\n\"They keep the enemy behind the borders, far away. They are not interested in any direct military confrontation which might lead to attacks on their cities or their homeland. They will maintain that status quo,\" he told Reuters.\n\nIran's foreign ministry said the latest attacks on Yemen were \"a flagrant violation of international law by the United States and Britain\", warning the continuation of such attacks was a \"worrying threat to international peace and security\".\n\nWhile the Houthis say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians, the U.S. and its allies characterize them as indiscriminate and a menace to global trade.\n\nMajor shipping lines have largely abandoned Red Sea shipping lanes for longer routes around Africa. This has increased costs, feeding worries about global inflation while denying Egypt crucial foreign revenue from use of the Suez Canal.\n\nHundreds of people attended a Baghdad funeral procession for 17 members of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) killed in the U.S. strikes. The PMF is a state security force containing several Iran-backed armed groups.\n\nHadi al-Ameri, a senior Iraqi politician close to Iran, said it was time to oust U.S. forces, 2,500 of whom are in Iraq in a mission to help prevent a resurgence of Islamic State. \"Their presence is pure evil for the Iraqi people,\" he said.\n\nIraq and the United States last month initiated talks about ending the U.S.-led coalition's presence in the country.\n\n(Additional reporting by Andrew Mills in Doha and Tala Ramadan in Dubai, Doina Chiacu, Arshad Mohammed and Humeyra Pamuk in Washington, Tom Perry in Beirut; Writing by Tom Perry and Simon Lewis; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Diane Craft)"}

However, buying physical properties can be costly, difficult and risky for an individual. Instead, investors can buy shares of diversified real estate investment trusts, or REITs. REITs are public companies that own large portfolios of real estate, and many of them also pay sizable dividends.\n\n\n\nThere are many different types of REITs, providing investors access to residential, commercial and specialty real estate. Here are nine of the best REITs to buy in 2024, according to Morningstar analysts:\n\n\n\nREIT stock Implied upside (over Feb. 2 close) Welltower Inc. (ticker: WELL) 17.1% Crown Castle Inc. (CCI) 20% Realty Income Corp. (O) 40.2% AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB) 33.1% SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC) 15.7% Equity Residential Properties Trust (EQR) 44.6% Boston Properties Inc. (BXP) 49.2% Invitation Homes Inc. (INVH) 24.2% Ventas Inc. (VTR) 55.3%\n\nWelltower Inc. (WELL)\n\nWelltower is a health care REIT that invests in health care facilities, including senior housing, specialty care facilities and medical office buildings. The REIT is up more than 18% in the past 12 months, the best performance of any stock on this list. Welltower closed $1.4 billion in acquisitions in the third quarter. Analyst Kevin Brown says the Affordable Care Act has been a tremendous tailwind for Welltower and other top health care real estate owners, given the best health care systems continue to funnel patients their way. Morningstar has a \"buy\" rating and $103 fair value estimate for WELL stock, which closed at $87.93 on Feb. 2.\n\nCrown Castle Inc. (CCI)\n\nCrown Castle Inc. is a specialty REIT that owns and operates wireless communications towers. Crown Castle shares are down more than 33% in the past year, the worst performance of any stock on this list. Analyst Matthew Dolgin says the factors that weighed on the stock in 2023 include activist pressure to divest the company's underperforming fiber business, a slowdown in wireless carrier spending, concerns over liquidity and a possible dividend cut. However, Dolgin says fears about the business are overblown and the dividend is safe. Morningstar has a \"buy\" rating and $130 fair value estimate for CCI stock, which closed at $108.32 on Feb. 2.\n\nRealty Income Corp. (O)\n\nRealty Income is a retail REIT that owns, develops and manages U.S. retail real estate with a focus on single-tenant buildings. It is the largest triple-net REIT in the U.S., meaning tenants pay all property expenses, including real estate taxes, maintenance and building insurance. Realty Income has a 5.7% dividend yield and makes monthly dividend payments, making it an attractive income source. Brown says Realty's retail clients are high-quality companies that are service-oriented, insulated from e-commerce competition or resistant to economic downturns. Morningstar has a \"buy\" rating and $76 fair value estimate for O stock, which closed at $54.19 on Feb. 2.\n\n\n\nAvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB)\n\nAvalonBay Communities is a multifamily residential REIT that specializes in upscale apartment communities. Brown says supply growth will weigh on AvalonBay's rent and net operating income (NOI) in 2024, but 4.9% job growth and income growth in the company's established markets will help support demand. Brown says the slower-growth outlook for 2024 does not impact his bullish long-term outlook for AvalonBay, and he projects the company will still generate same-store NOI growth about 1% above the inflation rate even in a difficult environment this year. Morningstar has a \"buy\" rating and $233 fair value estimate for AVB stock, which closed at $175.06 on Feb. 2.\n\nSBA Communications Corp. (SBAC)\n\nSBA Communications is a specialized REIT that owns and operates a global wireless communications tower network. Dolgin says SBA is well positioned in the U.S. market and has opportunities to accelerate its growth in international markets in 2024 and beyond. In fact, Dolgin says the company should abandon its risky strategy of leveraging up to fund stock buybacks and instead focus on opportunities to expand deeper into developing markets. Nevertheless, Dolgin says SBA will continue to grow its business at an impressive pace. Morningstar has a \"buy\" rating and $260 fair value estimate for SBAC stock, which closed at $224.71 on Feb. 2.\n\nEquity Residential Properties Trust (EQR)\n\nEquity Residential is a multifamily residential REIT that owns and operates a diversified portfolio of apartment properties. Brown says Equity's growth rate will likely slow in coming quarters given the company recently guided for 2024 same-store revenue growth of between 2% and 3% and same-store NOI growth of between 1% and 2.6%. However, Brown says the company's high-quality property portfolio focused on multifamily buildings in urban, coastal markets like Los Angeles and San Diego will continue to create value for investors in the long term. Morningstar has a \"buy\" rating and $87 fair value estimate for EQR stock, which closed at $60.17 on Feb. 2.\n\nBoston Properties Inc. (BXP)\n\nBoston Properties is an office REIT that owns office buildings in Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The stock has a 6% dividend yield, highest on this list. Analyst Suryansh Sharma says Boston Properties' initial 2024 guidance for a 2.5% decline in funds from operation this year was mostly in line with his expectations. Sharma says Boston Properties has a sound strategy of owning and developing top-tier properties that maintain high occupancy rates and premium rental rates even during economic downturns. Morningstar has a \"buy\" rating and $95 fair value estimate for BXP stock, which closed at $63.69 on Feb. 2.\n\nInvitation Homes Inc. (INVH)\n\nInvitation Homes owns, operates and leases single-family U.S. homes in the starter and move-up categories. Brown forecasts 3% growth in single-family housing starts in 2024, with a decline of 24% this year in multifamily housing starts. He says the cost of renting in Invitation Homes' core markets is lower than the cost of homeownership, a dynamic that supports high occupancy and allows for steady rent growth. In addition, Brown says Invitation Homes can control costs and boost margins by hiring its own maintenance and repair technicians. Morningstar has a \"buy\" rating and $41 fair value estimate for INVH stock, which closed at $33.02 on Feb. 2.\n\nVentas Inc. (VTR)"}

Doctors need to know intimate details about your health that you may not even share with friends or family members. If you're not comfortable sharing this information, you and your doctor may not be the right match.\n\n\"You certainly don\u2019t need to be friends \u2013 and probably shouldn\u2019t be, in order to maintain professional boundaries,\" says Jennifer L. FitzPatrick, a certified speaking professional based in Chester, Maryland, and author of the book \"Reimagining Customer Service in Healthcare.\" \"But you should feel like they care about your well-being.\"\n\nAt the bare minimum, you want to respect your primary health care provider and believe they respect you. That means your physician listens to you, responds promptly when you reach out and cares about your overall health.\n\nSigns that you're not comfortable with your doctor can include:\n\n\n\nFeeling rushed during appointments.\n\nNot feeling heard or understood.\n\nFeeling judged or dismissed.\n\nSimply feeling uneasy around your physician for reasons you may or may not be able to articulate.\n\n\u201cNot feeling comfortable with your doctor is an absolute red flag,\" says Jeremy Gurewitz, chief executive officer of Solace, a digital health platform company that connects people with patient advocates, based in Redwood City, California. \"If you don\u2019t feel at ease, how can you trust what they have to say?\u201d\n\nA lack of trust may cause you to not feel confident in their abilities or second-guess their judgment.\n\nBeyond establishing mutual respect with your doctor, it helps to have a list of non-negotiables and to ask them how they feel about certain issues that are important to you. For example, if you like to do your own research and discuss what you\u2019ve discovered about heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure or another health condition, it\u2019s important to make sure your physician doesn't have an autocratic demeanor. You want a doctor who will listen to you and who will not be condescending because you conducted your own research."}

Having conviction in a company and being willing to hold it forever doesn't always translate to market-beating returns over the long term.\n\nHistorical examples like General Electric Co. (ticker: GE) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) demonstrate the risks of such an approach, with shareholders of these once-dominant firms experiencing long-term total returns that have lagged behind the S&P 500 from 1986 to the present.\n\nThe key to mitigating these risks lies in diversification. By spreading investments across a variety of stocks from different sectors and even countries, investors can buffer against individual losses, allowing the better-performing assets to compensate over time.\n\nFor those looking to implement a diversified, long-term investment strategy with ease, Vanguard funds offer an ideal and accessible solution.\n\nVanguard boasts a vast array of options, with 86 exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, and 267 mutual funds that cover a broad spectrum of stocks and bonds, catering to investors with varying time horizons, risk tolerances and investment objectives.\n\nMoreover, Vanguard's unique shareholder-owned structure ensures that low fees are a hallmark of its fund lineup, enhancing the long-term value proposition for buy-and-hold investors.\n\n\"Very few, if any, investors should be paying 1% each year for investment advice and portfolio management,\" says Jordan Taylor, an independent financial advisor at Core Planning. \"Vanguard does a great job of trying to provide as many low-cost investment options as they can, something many asset management firms fail to do.\"\n\nHere are seven of the best Vanguard funds to buy and hold today:\n\n\n\nFund Expense ratio Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) 0.03% Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) 0.03% Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) 0.06% Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) 0.04% Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTWAX) 0.10% Vanguard Wellington Fund Investor Shares (VWELX) 0.25% Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 Fund (VLXVX) 0.08%\n\nVanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)\n\nGE and IBM aren\u2019t the only stocks to lag the S&P 500 over the long term. In fact, even most professionally managed funds do. According to the latest update to the S&P Indices Versus Active, or SPIVA study, 92.2% of all U.S. large-cap funds have underperformed the index over the past 15 years. Selecting the 7.8% of funds that do outperform ex-ante can be difficult to do consistently.\n\nThus, the path of least resistance here for a buy-and-hold investor is to just invest in the S&P 500. You can do this by buying VOO, which for the price of around $454 per share provides exposure to all the S&P 500 companies. Top holdings in VOO currently include Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA). VOO charges a 0.03% expense ratio.\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)\n\n\"I still believe that a quality ETF for a long-term growth portfolio from Vanguard is VTI, especially for investors who are not really near retirement and have the ability to invest monthly in up or down markets,\" says Jim Penna, senior manager of retirement services at VectorVest Inc. This ETF tracks the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index, which is much broader compared to the S&P 500 Index.\n\nVTI's portfolio currently consists of more than 3,700 stocks, or roughly 3,200 more than VOO. The ETF also includes mid- and small-cap stocks excluded by VOO and the S&P 500. However, because VTI is weighted by market capitalization, it shares similar top holdings with VOO, albeit in slightly smaller proportions. It also charges the same low 0.03% expense ratio.\n\nVanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)\n\nSome of the best companies to buy and hold forever can be large blue-chip firms with a long history of increasing dividends. To easily access a portfolio of these stocks, investors can buy VIG, which tracks the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index. This ETF screens companies for a 10-year history of dividend growth, while excluding the top 25% yielding companies to remove potential yield traps.\n\nThe result is a portfolio of over 300 notable names such as Microsoft, Apple, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). All this can be had for a low 0.06% expense ratio. The 1.8% 30-day SEC yield paid by VIG isn't the largest, but remember that this ETF focuses on growing dividends, not currently high yields.\n\nVanguard Value ETF (VTV)\n\nAspiring value investors who want to emulate Buffett's style, but in a more passive hands-off manner, can do so via VTV. This ETF tracks the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index, which is essentially the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index stripped down to focus on around 340 stocks deemed to have lower valuations in terms of price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. It charges a 0.04% expense ratio.\n\nCurrently, VTV's top holdings comprise a number of large value-oriented companies. In the No. 1 spot is Buffett's firm Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), followed by Broadcom, JPMorgan Chase, UnitedHealth Group, Exxon Mobil and Johnson & Johnson. Many of these companies pay dividends too, so it's no surprise that VTV has a decent 30-day SEC yield of 2.4%.\n\n\n\nVanguard Total World Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTWAX)\n\nIt's important to note that despite its size and strong historical performance, the U.S. stock market is not the only option out there in terms of geography. Investors can also diversify internationally to developed markets like the U.K., Canada, Germany and France, or to emerging markets like China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. This can hedge against a period of U.S. market stagnation.\n\nFor an all-in-one mutual fund that offers global diversification, consider VTWAX. This fund tracks the FTSE Global All Cap Index, which currently consists of more than 9,700 stocks weighted by market cap. Right now, VTWAX is roughly divided into 60% U.S. stocks, 30% developed market stocks and 10% emerging market stocks. It charges a 0.1% expense ratio and requires a $3,000 minimum investment.\n\nVanguard Wellington Fund Investor Shares (VWELX)\n\nFew Vanguard funds embody the \"buy-and-hold forever\" mentality as well as VWELX. This mutual fund was actually founded in 1929, making it the oldest balanced mutual fund in the U.S. Unlike the previous Vanguard funds, VWELX is actively managed, meaning that it does not replicate an index. Instead, Vanguard fund managers actively select and manage the stocks and bonds comprising it.\n\nVWELX's balanced portfolio is two-thirds in stocks with the remainder in bonds. For stocks, VWELX targets large- and mid-cap companies in out-of-favor industries that pay above-average dividends and have low valuations and good fundamentals. For bonds, the fund favors investment-grade corporate issues with intermediate duration. VWELX charges a 0.25% expense ratio and requires a $3,000 minimum.\n\nVanguard Target Retirement 2065 Fund (VLXVX)\n\nBuy-and-hold investors looking to stay completely hands-off can consider using a target-date fund.

She'll get no delegates in the for-show contest, and won't be able to claim any kind of momentum heading into her home state primary Feb. 24.\n\nThe reason is Trump himself, who continues to dominate the party and influence party apparatuses and procedures. When state lawmakers moved to replace Nevada's presidential caucuses with a more traditional, state-run primary to decide presidential preferences.\n\nBut that didn't go over well with a state GOP heavily made up of Trump loyalists. They wanted caucuses, which require people to show up at a specific place at a specific time, meaning the electorate is more likely to be dominated by the most devoted of voters \u2013 meaning Trump supporters.\n\n\n\nBest Cartoons on the 2024 Election View All 125 Images\n\nHolding a state government-run primary doesn't stop the party from holding caucuses anyway. So the party designed it so that candidates could either run in Tuesday's primary \u2013 with no delegates at stake \u2013 or compete in the caucuses Thursday, when 26 GOP delegates will be awarded. Voters also have to choose whether they will cast a ballot Tuesday or Thursday. They can't do both.\n\nThat has led to a great deal of confusion in the Silver State and a series of near-daily social media posts from the state party explaining the bizarre choice to voters.\n\n\"It makes the party look stupid, and the decision to do this was absolutely stupid,\" says Chuck Muth, former chairman of the Clark County Republican Party. \u201cWhere they really screwed up was in not allowing candidates to file in both the primary and the caucuses. The whole thing has been rigged for Trump anyway,\" adds Muth, who plans to vote for Trump but who was initially a supporter of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who dropped out of the primary race last month\n\n\n\nHaley's only notable competition Tuesday is Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and former Vice President Mike Pence, both of whom have since dropped out of the race (and Scott has endorsed Trump). Her biggest worry is a potentially good showing for \"none of these candidates,\" an option Nevada ballots give voters in both primary and general elections.\n\nThursday, Nevada Republicans will caucus to decide how to apportion their delegates. The only candidates under consideration are Trump and Ryan Binkley, a Texas businessman and pastor. DeSantis, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum filed to compete in the caucuses but have suspended their campaigns and so will not appear on the ballot.\n\n\"We will deliver you 100% of delegates of the state of Nevada to Donald J. Trump,\u201d Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald said at a recent rally for Trump in Las Vegas, a boast quite likely to succeed.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden is heavily favored to win the Nevada Democratic primary Tuesday, after a strong showing Saturday in South Carolina. An Emerson College poll in early January had Biden with 78% support, compared to 2% for self-help guru Marianne Williamson. Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who is not on the ballot, got 1% support, while the remaining 19% were undecided.\n\n\n\nIt all means that Nevada \u2013 proudly \"First in the West\" after fighting so hard to hold one of the early presidential nominating contests, won't be that important in the selection of either major party candidate.\n\n\"It won't mean anything this year,\" says Kenneth Miller, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"You have one competitive race, which was rendered non-competitive by the crazy, intra-party strife within the GOP.\"\n\nThat infighting is evident: Some Trump supporters outside of Nevada have complained that the election was rigged against Trump. Former Trump adviser Kash Patel, on a conservative show, held up a Nevada primary ballot and complained that the ballot does not include the front-runner's name. It's an \"election rig job for the mainstream media,\" who will then declare Haley the winner even though delegates will be selected two days later, Patel complained.\n\nRamaswamy \u2013 who quickly endorsed Trump after he left the race in January, also slammed Haley on social media.\n\n\"Nikki Haley is *not even on the ballot* in the Nevada GOP caucus & thus will get 0 delegates from NV. Here\u2019s the ugly TRUTH: she isn\u2019t even trying to beat Trump. Her sole strategy is to *eliminate* Trump. The plot is now more obvious than ever & it\u2019s pathetic that no one sees it,\" Ramaswamy wrote on social media.\n\n\n\nSo far, GOP turnout in early voting has lagged behind the Democrats, with 57,918 people casting early and mail-in ballots for the GOP primary as of last Friday\u2019s deadline, and 93,686 voting early or by mail in the Democratic primary.\n\nThat's likely more a function of the method of voting, Muth and others said, with Republicans \u2013 egged on by Trump, who is suspicious of mail-in and early voting \u2013 opting to vote on Election Day.\n\nMuth thinks that's a mistake, especially with a close general election contest shaping up for November."}

In some ways this replicates the more intimate experience of asking friends and neighbors if they would recommend their doctor, but done on a wider scale, consistent with the social media age.\n\nPatient experience ratings may not indicate the \u201cbest\u201d doctor, but can be helpful when choosing among doctors patients deem equally appropriate for their care.\n\nWhere does U.S. News get these patient experience ratings?\n\nU.S. News is working with Fountain Analytics, a leading provider of data analytics solutions for the healthcare industry. Fountain Analytics has developed the patient experience ratings from a model based on a paper published in the 2015 Patient Experience Journal by Parish, et.al from George Washington School of Public Health.\n\nFountain Analytics aggregates patient feedback from over two hundred online sources and then uses a proprietary Natural Language Processing technology to extract insights, categorize feedback and derive a score for 10 key patient experience categories identified in the research paper. To produce the overall score, Fountain Analytics combines the scores for each of the 10 categories, applying weights to each of the categories, based on which categories patients place more importance. (These category weights differ for surgical and non-surgical physicians.) A sample size multiplier is then also applied to arrive at the overall score.\n\nHow does U.S. News display these patient experience ratings?\n\nU.S. News displays the patient experience ratings from Fountain Analytics as a comparative measure among all doctors with ratings in each specialty, using the terms Excellent, Very Positive, Positive and Fair.\n\nThe patient experience ratings are shown as both an overall score and as ten individual metrics for the following areas:\n\nThoroughness of Examination\n\nAbility to Answer Questions\n\nClarity of Instructions\n\nProvider\u2019s Follow-Up\n\nAmount of Time with Patient\n\nProvider\u2019s Attitude\n\nProvider\u2019s Perceived Outcomes\n\nPatient Loyalty to Provider\n\nInclusion in Decisions\n\nGeneral Feedback\n\nSome physicians do not have patient experience ratings on the U.S. News website. In most cases, this is because U.S. News publishes the ratings only if the number of source reviews and the number of categories with data are above certain minimum thresholds, which U.S. News may amend from time to time.\n\nWhat is Fountain Analytic's Methodology?\n\nOverview\n\nU.S. News publishes physician patient experience ratings created by Fountain Analytics. Fountain Analytics collects patient reviews from over 200 online sources and groups them into ten categories that represent factors patients consider when choosing a physician. Each individual review (sentiment) is weighted according to what online source it comes from and how recently it was posted. A score for each of the ten categories is calculated by taking the mean of the weighted sentiment scores.\n\nAn overall score is then calculated by adding the scores for each of the ten categories which have been weighted according to several factors: how relatively important patients rate these categories (see Table 1), volume of ratings (so that any one rating does not have outsized effect), time decay (how old the reviews are), coverage (presence of reviews for each of the ten categories) and source coverage (variety of online sources of the review).\n\nFor each medical specialty, the overall score is translated into a rating, based on that specialty population\u2019s review volume and trends.\n\nSome physicians do not have patient experience ratings on the U.S. News website. In most cases, this is because U.S. News publishes the ratings only if the number of source reviews and the number of categories with data are above certain minimum thresholds, which U.S. News may amend from time to time.\n\nCategory Score Calculation\n\nEach Category rating is derived by finding the weighted mean sentiment.\n\nThe individual components of the Sentiment Score Weight are detailed below.\n\nSource Weights are assigned to each online patient review source (website) based on its influence on online audiences. The common criteria used to evaluate each source includes search engine rank, traffic, percentage of visits from search, author verification, number of referring domains, number of backlinks, volume of reviews, bounce rate, daily time on site, and daily pages viewed per visitor. Source weights are scaled from 0 to 100 and updated twice a year, as these criteria values change for the different sources.\n\nAge Weight is determined by the number of months between the current date and the published date of the sentiments (or aggregated sentiments). As sentiments age, they are given less weight. Each sentiment (or aggregated sentiments) that was published within the last 6 months is given an Age Weight of 1. Age Weight starts to reduce at 6 months, meaning a review published 6 months ago would receive an Age Weight of 0.995. The Age Weight continues to reduce to finally reach 0.505 when reviews are 48 months or older.\n\nAdjusted Volume is used to balance out the impact of a sentiment score that is obtained from a source that aggregates several ratings into a single averaged rating instead of displaying the individual ratings. Since the Category score is calculated using a weighted mean, this Adjusted Volume helps prevent the averaged rating from having an outsized effect on the calculation compared to the individual ratings collected from other sites. As most sites commonly display individual ratings, Adjusted Volume is rarely used.\n\nWhat if not all categories have review scores?\n\nWhen calculating the overall rating, provided data is available for the required minimum number of categories (which U.S. News may amend from time to time), if there are no sentiment scores for a particular category, but scores are available for other categories, the sentiment score for the missing category is imputed based on the average physician score from the available categories. The relative strength of each category over the physician population is used to estimate the missing value, based on the average.\n\nWhat if there are no reviews of a particular physician?\n\nIf a physician has no data at all, no score will be reported for any category and a rating will not be generated in this case.\n\nOverall Patient Score Calculation and Rating\n\nThe Overall Patient Experience Rating combines the category scores for physicians using the weights published in the 2015 Patient Experience Journal by Parish, et.al from George Washington School of Public Health. The weights are derived from the relative importance patients assign to these categories (listed in Table 1) and differ based on the type of physician being scored \u2013 Surgical or Non-Surgical.\n\nFinally, a Sample Size Multiplier is applied to adjust scores for small sample size. It ranges from 0.804 (when the sample size is 0) to 1 (when the sample size is greater than or equal to 50).\n\nTable 1: Category Weights\n\n\n\nCategory Labels\n\nSurgical Weights Non-Surgical Weights Provider\u2019s Attitude\n\n0.079 0.109 Ability to Answer Questions\n\n0.105 0.117 Amount of time with Patient\n\n0.082 0.095 Thoroughness of Examination\n\n0.126 0.141 Inclusion in Decisions\n\n0.114 0.117 Clarity of Instructions\n\n0.091 0.089 Provider\u2019s Perceived Outcomes\n\n0.161 0.109 Provider\u2019s Loyalty to Provider\n\n0.079 0.065 Provider\u2019s Follow-Up\n\n0.093 0.091 General Feedback\n\n0.070 0.067\n\nThe Areas of Expertise Methodology\n\nThe Areas of Expertise feature on doctor profiles provides you with information on the types of conditions and the volume of patients a doctor has treated during a three year period. That measure of experience can be a factor in helping you choose the best provider for you. The associated visuals depict how often the physician has treated that condition compared to others nationally and state-wide.\n\nU.S. News displays information on the relative volume of episodes of care each provider has managed or treated for that condition among Medicare patients in the last three years of available data (currently January 1, 2019-December 31, 2021). An episode roughly translates to the number of patients treated for a condition, but can include repeat treatment of the same person depending on the specific condition or timeframe. This episode data comes from Medicare claims and is aggregated using the Episode Grouper for Medicare (EGM) and provided to U.S. News by a third party vendor, CareJourney.\n\nFor each provider, U.S. News looks at the episode volume for each condition or treatment type. On a national level, providers are placed in a percentile by comparing episode volume to other providers who manage or treat the same condition. On a state level, the percentiles are averaged for providers within the same state who manage or treat the same condition.\n\nIf a provider sees fewer than 11 patients for a particular condition, the provider will not be included in the benchmarking calculations. In such cases, U.S. News will only indicate that the provider has provided care for that condition, but will not display the volume percentile, nor benchmark against other doctors who also provide care for that condition."}

When you go for your yearly check-up, you\u2019ll likely have a routine blood test for creatinine. In some cases, your doctor may order a urine creatinine clearance test.\n\nHigh blood creatinine levels can indicate that your body has a reduced ability to get rid of waste products \u2013 an important kidney function. Even if you feel fine, elevated blood creatinine levels may be a cause of concern.\n\nLearn more about normal, high and low levels, when to worry about your creatine levels, and what to do about them.\n\n\n\nWhat Is Creatinine?\n\nCreatinine is a waste product that results from the breakdown of creatine, which is stored in the muscles.\n\n\u201cCreatinine can come from a variety of sources. The body can make it by itself, it can come from the diet, or it can come from cell breakdown,\u201d explains Dr. Amy Yau, a nephrologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.\n\nCreatinine levels are just one way of assessing how well the kidneys are working.\n\n\u201cWe use creatinine to help us estimate kidney function because creatinine is what\u2019s called \u2018freely filtered,\u2019\u201d Yau explains. \u201cIt\u2019s freely filtered by the kidney, and so we have an idea of what a normal creatinine should be in most people with intact kidney function.\u201d\n\n\n\nKidney function\n\nYour kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs with one located on each side of the spine, right beneath your ribcage. Kidneys are part of the urinary tract and have several system-wide functions, including:\n\n\n\nFiltering the blood to remove waste and excess fluid through the urine. After your kidneys filter the blood, they return vital minerals and nutrients to your body.\n\nMaintaining a balance of water, nutrients like vitamin D and minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus, sodium and potassium.\n\nCreating hormones that control blood pressure, develop red blood cells and keep bones strong.\n\n\u201cWhen creatinine is high, it actually means that the kidney is not doing very well,\u201d says Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cIt\u2019s not really getting rid of all the toxins in the body. When creatinine is low or normal, that\u2019s when you can think that the kidney is doing its job filtering the blood and working fine.\u201d\n\nKidney disease involves a gradual loss of kidney function. As the kidneys progressively lose their filtering ability, toxic levels of fluids, minerals and waste build up in the body.\n\n\n\nWhat Causes Kidney Problems\n\nMedical conditions and other risk factors for kidney disease include:\n\n\n\nDiabetes . High blood sugar can damage blood vessels and nephrons in the kidney over time.\n\nHigh blood sugar can damage blood vessels and nephrons in the kidney over time. High blood pressure.

Renal cell cancer is the most common type of kidney cancer.\n\nAlso known as kidney and renal pelvis cancer. Renal cell cancer is the most common type of kidney cancer. COVID-19. Long COVID causes multiple effects including blood clots that may affect small vessels in the kidneys.\n\nSigns of Kidney Disease\n\nIn the early stages, kidney disease is \"silent\" with few signs or symptoms, often preventing it from being detected until it\u2019s advanced. If caught early, underlying causes of kidney disease \u2013 such as high blood pressure, diabetes, polycystic kidney disease (an inherited, chronic condition that causes fluid-filled cysts to form in the kidney) and inflammation of the glomeruli \u2013 can be treated.\n\nUnfortunately, as a result, sometimes people will feel healthy, but in reality, the disease is very advanced. Advanced kidney damage can progress to kidney failure, which means patients must eventually require dialysis or have a kidney transplant.\n\nIn other cases, some may develop signs or symptoms that include the following:\n\n\n\nCreatinine Blood Test\n\nBecause people rarely experience early physical symptoms of kidney disease, it's especially important to screen for abnormal creatinine levels, which can indicate poor kidney function.\n\nTypically, when you visit your doctor for an annual wellness visit, they'll order a routine blood test, called a basic metabolic panel, also referred to as a BMP. If your creatinine blood test result shows elevated levels, your doctor might want more information to determine how well your kidneys are working.\n\nYou may leave the office with a homework assignment to collect your urine for the next 24 hours to provide a follow-up sample for further testing. You\u2019ll also be asked to drink at least eight glasses of fluid during that period to provide an adequate sample to measure how effectively and efficiently your kidneys clear creatinine from your body. Hospitalized patients sometimes have a 24-hour urine collection done as part of their inpatient care.\n\nSignificantly high creatinine levels or upward trends would trigger a comprehensive diagnostic workup to determine the underlying causes.\n\nHowever, creatinine levels alone don\u2019t tell the whole story. They\u2019re evaluated in conjunction with various other laboratory results, including estimated glomerular filtration rate and blood urea nitrogen.\n\nEstimated glomerular filtration rate\n\nGetting an accurate, measured glomerular filtration rate, or GFR, is an incredibly challenging process. Therefore, clinicians typically use a formula to check your GFR, which estimates how much blood passes through the glomeruli, tiny units found at the end of the kidneys that filter the blood, each minute.\n\n\u201cThere are multiple different types of equations to estimate the GFR, which is what really tells us how well the kidney is filtering,\" Yau explains. \"That GFR equation is stratified based on your age. What might be a normal creatinine and reflect a normal GFR for a person who is 20 years old may be different, or a not-so-worrisome creatinine, in a person who\u2019s 80 years old may reflect a lower GFR.\u201d\n\nBlood urea nitrogen\n\nBlood urea nitrogen, or BUN, measures the amount of urea nitrogen, a waste product of protein digestion, in the blood. The protein waste is excreted by healthy kidneys. BUN is an indirect marker of kidney function, but it can be affected by other things too, like dehydration, certain medications and a high-protein diet.\n\nTesting for BUN is often part of routine blood work; however, your doctor may also order a blood test to measure BUN levels if they suspect you have kidney disease.\n\nDoctors take the creatinine, GFR and BUN results together to give them an idea of how the kidney is functioning.\n\nNormal Creatinine Levels\n\nNormal creatinine levels generally fall between 0.7 and 1.2 milligrams per deciliter. However, they aren\u2019t exactly the same for everyone.\n\nCertain factors affect an individual patient\u2019s normal creatinine levels. Because creatinine is made by your skeletal muscle cells, your baseline creatinine range is affected by your size and muscle mass. Bodybuilders might have higher creatinine levels, whereas women tend to have slightly lower creatinine levels than men.\n\nHaving had amputations also affects baseline creatinine, Yau notes.\n\nCreatinine levels should not change dramatically over time.\n\nHigh Creatinine Levels\n\nWhat are high creatinine levels?\n\nWhile normal creatinine levels typically ranges from 0.7 and 1.2 milligrams per deciliter, no single number indicates that your creatinine levels are too high, so doctors will track your numbers over time to look for a change.\n\nIt\u2019s important for patients not to confuse creatinine and GFR trends, Al-Aly notes. GFR works in the opposite way \u2013 a good number can go up to 100%, he says. When GFR is high that indicates good kidney function \u2013 everything\u2019s fine. Lower GFR suggests decreased kidney function and is an indication of disease.\n\nWhat causes high creatinine levels?\n\nFactors that can elevate creatinine levels but don't necessarily indicate kidney problems include:\n\n\n\nCertain conditions, like a muscle injury.\n\nTaking creatine supplements. Bodybuilders may take creatine supplements to help build muscle.\n\nHigh muscle mass.\n\nYour diet. Consuming a lot of meat can increase creatinine levels without signaling a significant kidney problem.\n\nWhat are high creatinine symptoms?\n\nHigh creatinine levels often indicate poor kidney function. Symptoms of high creatinine levels and kidney disfunction may include:\n\n\n\nFatigue.\n\nSwelling.\n\nChanges in frequency, consistency or color of urine.\n\nNausea or vomiting.\n\nMuscle weakness or cramping.\n\nWhen should I worry about high creatinine levels?\n\nWhen you have a high level of creatinine, this doesn't always mean that your kidneys are not working well.\n\n\"We have other factors that can increase your creatinine level and it has nothing to do with your kidney function,\" says Dr. Suzanne El-Sayegh, chief of nephrology at Staten Island University Hospital in New York.\n\nIt's important to consult with your health care provider. Your provider may take into account:\n\n\n\nBlood or urine test results.\n\nMagnitude of increase in creatinine levels.\n\nRate of increase of your creatinine levels.\n\nSeverity of symptoms that are accompanying your levels.\n\nAny underlying conditions.\n\nCan I improve creatinine levels on my own?\n\nWays to help lower your creatinine levels include:\n\n\n\nMaintain a balanced diet.\n\nHydrate.\n\nAvoid creatine supplements.\n\nAvoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs.\n\nLimit alcohol intake.\n\nQuit smoking.\n\nIf you're concerned about your creatinine levels, it's important to consult with a health care provider.\n\nWhat are the treatments for high creatinine?\n\nTreatment for high creatinine levels depends on the underlying cause and should always be individualized. Your health care provider may recommend to:\n\n\n\nManage underlying health conditions, like diabetes or hypertension.\n\nAdjust medications if they could be affecting your kidney function.\n\nMake lifestyle modifications, like adding more physical activity or following a well-balanced diet.\n\nIn more severe cases, if creatinine levels are signaling advanced kidney disease, dialysis or kidney transplantation may be considered.\n\nAny interventions or treatments should be done under the guidance of a health care professional.\n\nLow Creatinine Levels\n\nWhat are low creatinine levels?\n\nNormal creatinine levels generally fall between 0.7 and 1.2 milligrams per deciliter. If an individual's creatinine levels consistently fall below the lower limit of the range, it may be considered low. However, it's important to consider low creatinine levels in the context of the individual's overall health and medical history.\n\nWhat causes low creatinine levels?\n\nCreatinine levels might be lower in these cases:\n\n\n\nPregnancy. Plasma is the largest part of your blood. If your plasma volume is increased because you\u2019re pregnant, then your creatinine level will be falsely low.\n\nPlasma is the largest part of your blood. If your plasma volume is increased because you\u2019re pregnant, then your creatinine level will be falsely low. Vegetarianism. Sometimes vegetarians don\u2019t have a lot of creatinine because they do not consume meat or aren't consuming much protein.\n\nSometimes vegetarians don\u2019t have a lot of creatinine because they do not consume meat or aren't consuming much protein. Muscle loss. A very thin, frail person, such as a nursing home resident who has lost a lot of muscle mass, can have extremely low creatinine levels, such as 0.2 or 0.3 milligrams per deciliter, Al-Aly says. \u201cIt\u2019s not an indication that the kidney is doing a great job,\u201d he points out. \u201cIt\u2019s an indication that they don\u2019t even have any muscle left over to even make creatinine for us to measure.\u201d\n\nTaking certain medications also may interfere with your levels of creatinine, such as H2 blockers taken for acid reflux (Pepcid) or some antibiotics like Bactrim, which is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.\n\nWhat are low creatinine symptoms?\n\nLow creatinine levels do not typically cause symptoms. However, if the cause is attributed to reduced muscle function, you may experience the following symptoms:\n\n\n\nFatigue.\n\nMuscle weakness.\n\nDecrease in physical strength.\n\nImpaired mobility or coordination.\n\nWhen should I worry about low creatinine levels?\n\nIn general, below-normal creatinine levels are benign and not cause for concern. However, very low levels can be a sign of malnourishment or significant muscle mass loss.\n\nHow do I raise creatinine levels on my own?\n\nIf your creatinine levels are low enough that they are cause for concern, it's crucial to work with a health care provider. A qualified health care provider will likely perform a thorough evaluation, taking into account your overall health and medical history, to determine if further investigation or intervention is needed.\n\nWhat is the treatment for low creatinine?\n\nTreatment for low creatinine levels primarily targets the underlying cause. For example, if levels are dangerously low due to malnourishment, treatment may involve eating a well-balanced diet with adequate amounts of protein to support muscle health.\n\nWhat to Do About Abnormal Creatinine Levels\n\nEl-Sayegh emphasizes that people should not feel alarmed when they see a creatinine level that's a little elevated or a GFR that's a little low.\n\n\"With aging, we lose some of our kidney function, so that's a normal process of aging,\" she says.\n\nThere's a lot you can do to improve or maintain your kidney function, such as:\n\n\n\nQuit smoking.\n\nLose weight.\n\nAvoid unnecessary over-the-counter medications.\n\nVisit your doctor regularly so they can screen you for an early diagnosis of kidney disease.\n\n\"We don't want to wait until it's really irreversible,\" El-Sayegh says.\n\nOnce the underlying cause of decreased kidney function is determined, your health care team can develop a treatment plan to improve kidney function \u2013 such as starting medication to lower blood pressure or manage diabetes. You will likely need to see a nephrologist for disease-specific treatment if chronic kidney disease itself is the problem.\n\nKeep in mind that creatinine levels alone aren\u2019t enough to pinpoint a specific health condition."}

Thaksin has repeatedly pledged loyalty to the monarchy.\n\nInsulting the crown is a serious offence and a major slur in Thailand, where the constitution states the king must be held in a position of \"revered worship\". The lese-majeste law is among the world's strictest, with each perceived offence punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nThe influential Thaksin, prime minister from 2001-2006, made a dramatic homecoming last August from 15 years in self-imposed exile to serve an eight-year jail sentence for abuse of power, later commuted to one year by the king.\n\nThe billionaire is being detained at a hospital with an undisclosed health problem and has yet to spend a full night in prison. He is eligible for parole later this month.\n\nPrayut Petchkhun, spokesperson for the attorney-general's office, told reporters the seven-year delay in acting on the royal insults complaint was because Thaksin had been abroad.\n\nHe gave no timeframe for when a decision would be taken, adding Thaksin, 74, had denied wrongdoing and provided authorities with \"a letter requesting fairness\". He did not elaborate on the allegation against Thaksin.\n\nIf Thaksin is freed he would be detained by police, Prayut said, adding he could be released temporarily while the attorney general considers whether to press charges.\n\nThaksin's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThailand current government is backed by the Shinawatra family, with Thaksin's return coinciding with ally and real estate mogul Srettha Thavisin becoming prime minister that same day.\n\nThaksin's allies have denied speculation of a backroom political deal between the former leader and his powerful enemies.\n\nThe announcement of a possible new case against Thaksin comes a week after Move Forward, the biggest party in parliament, was forced by a court to abandon its controversial plan to amend the lese-majeste law.\n\nMove Forward was hit days after by a succession of complaints seeking its dissolution and life bans for dozens of lawmakers over its stance on the law protecting the crown.\n\n(Reporting by Panu Wongcha-um and Panarat Thepgumpanat; Editing by Martin Petty)"}

It killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey, some 5,900 in Syria, and left millions homeless.\n\nIn the southeastern Turkish province of Hatay, the country's worst-hit, people called for the government and local authorities to resign during the vigil, and demanded that officials do not present themselves at the memorial, while booing speeches.\n\nIn the main square of the city of Hatay, located in the province, some chanted, \"Can anybody hear my voice?\" as Health Minister Fahrettin Koca spoke, a slogan referring to calls heard from under the rubble as people waited for days for help to arrive. Residents say many people died not because of the buildings collapsing, but rather from waiting for so long trapped in the rubble in the cold.\n\nWar in Israel and Gaza View All 194 Images\n\nAfter the vigil, people tossed flowers into the Asi River, which runs through the city.\n\nMerve Gursel, who lost her aunt, her aunt's husband and her cousins in the earthquake, called out their names as she tossed a carnation into the water for each one.\n\n\"Nobody was with these people that day.

Kittikhoun committed to implementing ASEAN\u2019s \u201cfive-point consensus\u201d for peace in Myanmar through continued \u201cquiet diplomacy,\" according to a council diplomat familiar with the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private.\n\nThe military leadership in Myanmar has so far ignored the plan, and violence and the humanitarian crisis in the country have been growing at a rapid pace.\n\nBefore the council meeting, nine of the 15 council members stood before reporters to support a statement read by Britain\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward, which echoed ASEAN\u2019s call urging Myanmar\u2019s armed forces, \u201cin particular, to cease its attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure.\u201d\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nThe military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, and is facing an armed pro-democracy resistance movement that is assisted by ethnic minority fighting forces. The military stepped up airstrikes after the three ethnic minority armed groups launched a major offensive in late October, seizing towns in the country\u2019s northeast, along with major border crossings for trade with China.\n\nThe nine council members \u2014 Ecuador, France, Japan, Malta, South Korea, Slovenia, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States \u2014 said that, three years after the military takeover, more than 18 million people need humanitarian aid and 2.6 million remain displaced.\n\nAt an ASEAN ministerial meeting on Jan. 29, Lao Foreign Minister Saleumxay Kommasith told reporters that Thailand was moving ahead with plans to provide more humanitarian assistance to Myanmar. The nine nations reiterated the council's appeal for improved humanitarian access.\n\nThey expressed increasing concern at the situation in Rakhine state bordering Bangladesh, where more than 1 million Rohingya Muslims fled starting in August 2017, when the military in Buddhist-dominated Myanmar launched a brutal \u201cclearance operation\u201d against them following attacks by the insurgent Arakan Army.\n\nThe Arakan Army is part of the alliance of ethnic minority fighters. A Bangladesh official said Monday that more than 100 members of Myanmar\u2019s Border Guard Police fled fighting with the Arakan Army in Rakhine over the past two days and entered Bangladesh, the first time Myanmar forces have been known to flee the country since the ethnic minority armies' offensive began.\n\nThe nine council nations expressed increasing concern that the Rohingya still in Myanmar, who have faced systematic discrimination for decades, are now contending with more restrictions on freedom of movement, as well as the denial of access to medicine and medical care. They demanded the implementation of the Security Council's first-ever resolution on Myanmar, passed in December 2022, which calls for an immediate end to violence and immediate release of all \u201carbitrarily detained\u201d prisoners, including Suu Kyi and former President Win Myint.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, who still represents Suu Kyi\u2019s ousted government, urged the Security Council on Monday to adopt a stronger, enforceable resolution, saying, \u201cDemocratic forces are gaining ground and the military junta is losing every day.\u201d\n\nThe nine council members said they remain deeply concerned at the lack of progress on the resolution\u2019s call for all parties to respect human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, and \u201cthe democratic will and interests\u201d of people in Myanmar.\n\nThe council diplomat said there was no unanimity at the meeting Monday on next steps, though there was broad concern at the escalating situation across the country with the military fighting on several fronts, the risk of atrocities in Rakhine, and the need for better humanitarian access.\n\nThe United States pushed for an enforceable Security Council resolution to prevent Myanmar from getting jet fuel, the council diplomat said.\n\nThe U.S., U.K., European Union and others imposed sanctions in 2023 on the provision of aviation fuel to Myanmar, but Amnesty International reported Jan. 31 that new evidence suggests Myanmar's military is using new tactics to evade sanctions.\n\nThe human rights organization called 2023 the worst year for airstrikes in Myanmar since the takeover, and said at least seven shipments of aviation fuel to Myanmar were directly linked to a storage unit in Vietnam, an ASEAN member.\n\nAccording to the council diplomat, China, which has close ties to Myanmar, emphasized the need to give ASEAN's efforts time and space. Russia, which also has links to Myanmar, reiterated that the council shouldn\u2019t be interfering in the country\u2019s internal affairs."}

The market capitalization of DeFi-linked crypto tokens has risen to $77 billion, from $72 billion at the start of December, as per CoinGecko.\n\nThe DeFi ethos is starkly different from that of the regulated financial system. It seeks to replicate the usual processes of investing, borrowing and trading, but in a decentralized world where peer-to-peer transactions on the blockchain are executed via smart contracts, with no banks or brokers acting as intermediaries.\n\nThe anticipation of lower U.S. interest rates has also boosted the appeal of DeFi protocols, where investors can deposit their crypto tokens in exchange for yields, many market participants say.\n\n\"For the first time in a year or so the rate that you can get in DeFi is higher than the U.S. Treasury rate,\" said Michael Rinko, analyst at Delphi Digital.\n\nFor example, the popular Aave protocol offered annual percentage rates on ethereum-based USDC stablecoin deposits of over 14%, according to tracker Aavescan.\n\n\"The market is front-running (Fed rate cuts) in terms of capital flowing to DeFi,\" said Phillip Shoemaker, executive director of decentralized ID platform Identity.com.\n\nBeware the extreme volatility that has characterized this sector in recent years; deposits in DeFi-focused blockchains jumped from $17.3 billion in January 2021 to nearly $178 billion in December that year, before falling below $40 billion in December 2022, according to Defi Llama data.\n\nSOLANA SOARS AND SLIPS\n\nThe recent rise in DeFi deposits has coincided with a surge in the prices of bitcoin and ethereum early in January, primarily driven by the American spot bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds).\n\n\"Traders have greater liquidity because their bitcoin and ethereum is worth more, so they begin to go down the risk scale and venture into more risky assets,\" said Thomas Tang, vice president, investment lead at venture-capital firm Ryze Labs.\n\nYet despite a blistering start to the year, bitcoin and ethereum - the two biggest cryptocurrencies - have surrendered most of their gains and are now up just 0.2% and 0.5% respectively.\n\nThat has hit the prices of many DeFi tokens.\n\nA CoinDesk index tracking DeFi-related tokens has fallen 13% in 2024, while the token of the Solana blockchain - one of the most popular DeFi chains - has slipped 5.7%.\n\nSome market players think DeFi activity could be more sustainable this time round, given solana has quadrupled in price over the past six months, far outpacing bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nOthers foresee some tough months ahead for DeFi, with financial markets yet again pushing back expectations for interest-rate cuts.\n\nIt also remains to be seen how sustainable new DeFi yield offerings are, said Katie Talati, director of research at asset manager Arca.\n\n\"I don't think we'll immediately see the impact of rate cuts on DeFi activity, I think it will take some time to see users and activity trickle back in,\" Talati added.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Mattackal and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Vidya Ranganathan and Pravin Char)"}

So such regulatory announcements and potential official buying could discourage this and help prop up prices like we\u2019ve seen today.\n\n\"But it doesn't solve the underlying problems of an economy undergoing a lengthy transformation.

I think that HS2 was one of the ways we were going to improve that, and now it's not going to happen,\" said local resident Andy Lewis as he waited patiently for a train at the historic railway station, a regional hub almost two centuries old.\n\nVoters across northern England were instrumental in driving the Conservatives to a big election win in 2019, inspired by Boris Johnson's pledges to deliver the dividends of Brexit and \"level up\" Britain's regions, long the poor cousins to London.\n\nMore than four years on, the political ground has shifted and opinion polls show the ruling party losing that support, a reversal that could help put it on course for a thumping national defeat by Labour at a general election expected this year.\n\nJohnson was ousted as prime minister by his own lawmakers over COVID lockdown breaches, triggering a bout of chaotic infighting that saw Liz Truss reign for a matter of weeks before she too was forced out and replaced by Rishi Sunak, whose own premiership has been marked by resignations and rebellion.\n\nThe levelling-up drive has since been dented by the axing of the northern leg of the HS2 rail network, a project aimed at better connecting-up Britain's cities and economy, in a move decried by the former PM Johnson as \"betraying the north of the country and the whole agenda of levelling up\".\n\nMany local businesses and residents had hoped the Crewe-to-Manchester spur of HS2 would bring billions of pounds of investment into the town.\n\n\"That was our opportunity, really, and I guess now it's gone,\" said Paul Colman, chief executive of the region's South Cheshire Chambers of Commerce.\n\nThe northern leg was cancelled by Sunak in September as estimated costs for the overall HS2 project soared above 100 billion pounds ($126 billion) and the infrastructure watchdog warned there was a fundamental problem with Britain's ability to manage such large projects.\n\nSunak described it as a tough decision, but one driven by the spiralling cost, as well as a reduction in passenger numbers following the COVID pandemic. Speaking in the northern town of Accrington in January, he said all money saved by cancelling the northern leg would be reinvested across the country.\n\n\"Fixing potholes, capping bus fares at two pounds, improving your local roads, dealing with pinch points, electrifying rail lines across the north, east, west. And that for me is all levelling up,\" the prime minister added.\n\nNonetheless, Crewe's Conservative member of parliament Kieran Mullan acknowledged that the loss of the HS2 link was a blow.\n\n\"I was disappointed,\" he told Reuters. \"It had particular potential to help us when it came to connectivity.\"\n\nHe said the government had committed to extensive work to regenerate Crewe in light of the cancellation, though.\n\n\"I think actually people understand that levelling up is not an overnight challenge,\" he added. \"It might be a generational challenge to unpick some of this longstanding inequality.\"\n\n'RED WALL' TURNS ON SUNAK\n\nThat may be of limited value to the party in the coming months. The parliamentary seat for Crewe and neighbouring Nantwich is likely to revert to Labour at the next election, four separate polling models over the past year have predicted.\n\nCrewe is part of the \"Red Wall\" of constituencies in the north of England that have traditionally voted Labour, but which swung to the Conservatives in 2019. They are widely expected to be crucial to the outcome of the election set to be held this year, and the omens are unhappy for Sunak and his party.\n\nA YouGov opinion poll last week showed only 20% of voters in the north intended to vote Conservative compared with 37% before Johnson's 2019 election landslide win.\n\nThe government's perceived failure to deliver on levelling is one reason Red Wall voters are abandoning the Conservatives, according to polling published in November from advocacy group More in Common, which researches the polarisation of society. The issue ranked fourth, behind illegal immigration, health service failures and government competence.\n\nNationally, Sunak's Conservatives are almost 20 points on average behind the Labour Party in opinion polls carried out over the last couple of months and on track to lose more than half of their 349 parliamentary seats, according to the Electoral Calculus polling analysis website.\n\nLONDON VERSUS THE REST?\n\nBritain remains a divided nation.\n\nLondon's share of the national economy has surged by over 3 percentage points since 2000 to 24%, with no other British region increasing its share over the same period, according to official data.\n\nComparable data from the EU statistics agency Eurostat show far less polarisation between regions in Germany and France.\n\nInvestment data illustrates the gap.\n\nPublic infrastructure spending in London between 2010 and 2021 totalled 4,763 pounds per person, adjusted for inflation, official data shows. That's 63% more than the average outside the capital, according to Reuters calculations.\n\n\"The gap between London and the rest of the UK - and particularly poorer areas - is at the extreme among OECD economies,\" said Diane Coyle, professor of economics at Cambridge University.\n\n\"Even a country like France, which is highly politically centralised, has a system whereby there is a constitutionally guaranteed distribution of funding,\" she said.\n\n\"So we stand out.\"\n\nOver the last 20 years, more political power has flowed to the regions - including parliaments for Scotland and Wales and elected city-region mayors - but that devolution now needed to include economic levers such as control over infrastructure spending, Coyle added.\n\n'BOARDED UP AND DERELICT'\n\nHS2, once billed as Europe's biggest infrastructure project, has been halved in size since the Conservatives won their 2019 landslide. Originally the line would have connected London to the northern cities of Manchester and Leeds, but it will now terminate at Birmingham, about 100 miles (161 km) north of London.\n\nEven after the construction of the shortened HS2, Britain will lag France, Germany, Italy and Spain several times over in terms of dedicated high speed rail track capacity, according to OECD data.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer has said, if elected, he won't revive the northern leg of HS2, describing the budget as \"blown\" and citing the fact that contracts are already being cancelled. Instead, he says he would stick with Sunak's Northern Powerhouse Rail plan to improve east-to-west rail links in the north.\n\nLabour also promises to transfer more power from Westminster, giving local leaders greater economic autonomy.\n\nThis may be cold comfort for Crewe.\n\nBusiness leaders stress the town's continuing advantages as a well-connected centre for distribution and manufacturing, though concede the loss of HS2 is a major blow.\n\nMark Haase, chief executive of SG World, whose activities in Crewe including printing, manufacturing and software development, said the town was an \"amazing area\" for business.\n\nThe company may nonetheless have to look further afield of new business opportunities because the downsizing of HS2 would make it more difficult to further improve supply chains between Crewe, the rest of the north of England and Scotland, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the building site that was supposed to turn into a retail and entertainment centre has been downgraded for temporary use, perhaps as a go-kart track or a trampoline park.\n\nMullan, the Conservative MP for Crewe, said he appreciated people were frustrated by the axing of the retail plans.\n\n\"But actually that means in the short term, we can probably do something with the space,\" he added. \"It's this space having been boarded up and derelict that I think has dragged down the town centre for too long.\"\n\n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; Graphics by Sumanta Sen; Editing by William Schomberg and Pravin Char)"}

(AP) \u2014 The Mississippi Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday in a dispute over a state law that would put $10 million of federal pandemic relief money into infrastructure grants for private schools.\n\nHinds County Chancery Judge Crystal Wise Martin blocked the law in October 2022 after Parents for Public Schools sued the state. The nonprofit group argued the grants would give private schools a competitive advantage over public schools.\n\n\u201cAny appropriation of public funds to be received by private schools adversely affects schools and their students,\u201d Martin wrote. \u201cTaxpayer funding for education is finite.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit cited a section of the Mississippi Constitution that prohibits the use of public money for any school that is not \u201ca free school.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2022 legislative session, Mississippi\u2019s Republican-controlled House and Senate made plans to spend most of the $1.8 billion that the state received for pandemic relief.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nOne bill signed by Republican Gov. Tate Reeves created a grant program to help private schools pay for water, broadband and other infrastructure projects. Another allocated the $10 million of federal money for the program as of July 1, 2022.\n\nThe program allowed grants of up to $100,000 to any in-state school that is a member of the Midsouth Association of Independent Schools and is accredited by a state, regional or national organization.\n\nPublic schools could not apply for the infrastructure grants. Legislators created a program to provide interest-free loans to public schools to improve buildings and other facilities, with money coming from the state. Those loans must be repaid within 10 years. The grants to private schools would not need to be repaid.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, the Mississippi Center for Justice and Democracy Forward filed the lawsuit in June 2022 on behalf of Parents for Public Schools, an advocacy group founded more than 30 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the private school funding at issue here originated with federal funds makes no difference,\u201d attorneys representing Parents of Public Schools wrote in papers filed with the state Supreme Court. \u201cThese particular federal funds became part of the state treasury, and the Legislature chose to spend them to help schools \u2014 and, more specifically, private schools.\u201d\n\nThe private schools\u2019 infrastructure grant program was to be overseen by the Mississippi Department of Finance and Administration.\n\nRepresenting DFA, the state attorney general's office wrote in a filing to the Supreme Court that public school students \u201chave benefited massively \u2014 and, compared to private school students, lopsidedly\u201d from federal pandemic relief money.\n\nState attorneys also wrote that the Mississippi Constitution only blocks the Legislature from sending money directly to private schools.\n\n\u201cIt does not bar the Legislature from appropriating funds to an agency with directions to support non-free schools,\u201d the state attorneys wrote.\n\nThe chancery judge, Martin, wrote in her ruling that Mississippi\u2019s public education system has been \u201cchronically underfunded.\u201d A 1997 state law established a formula called the Mississippi Adequate Education Program, intended to ensure schools receive enough money to meet midlevel academic standards. Legislators have fully funded the formula only two years."}

Working with Chinese rappers like the popular Higher Brothers, he has always interspersed English song lyrics with a catchy Chinese chorus.\n\nFar from the flex-heavy culture of rap songs in the Top 40, his latest album \u201cMake You Proud\u201d is a heartfelt, bilingual exploration of the musician\u2019s life. In it, Phoenix hits back at the haters who say his Chinese isn\u2019t good, and speaks of his own naivety in the commercialized space that is the music industry, and what he\u2019s most known for: the dual strands of his Chinese and American lives.\n\nThe album was a personal challenge, Phoenix said. He\u2019s most proud of its eponymous first song, in which he raps about his average grades in China and moving to the U.S. at age 11, over a repeating series of piano chords.\n\n\u201cWhen I was posting on Douyin and Chinese social media, people were like \u2026 'his Chinese sounds weird,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview with The Associated Press. The comments got to him. \u201cIt just got to a point where I was like, I do feel like it\u2019s time to challenge myself as an artist.\u201d\n\nOnce he decided to take the challenge, the rhymes came naturally. His lyrics are different from Chinese rappers who try to compete in the complexity of their rhymes, often using chengyu, four-character literary proverbs. It\u2019s straightforward, though critics say the vocabulary is simple, at the level of a third-grader.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nPhoenix said he\u2019s happy with the result, \u201cI had never been able to tell my story so clearly in Chinese before,\u201d he said.\n\nFor an artist who started rapping in English, Chinese was at first just an ornamentation in his music. But as he got older, Phoenix says he felt more compelled to use Chinese and being more in touch with his mother tongue. When he moved back to China in 2017, he said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t soundcheck without someone\u2019s help, because I just didn\u2019t know how to say certain equipment on stage.\u201d\n\nHis album also touches on politics, though Phoenix says he has never thought of himself or his work as political. Yet its release comes a year after China lifted strict COVID-19 lockdowns, during which passenger flights were reduced and pandemic border controls kept families separated. Phoenix himself couldn\u2019t get a visa to go back and see his family for three years.\n\nHis music touches on the rise of rap in China as well as the pointed questions raised when Black Lives Matter protests burst out nationwide in the U.S. after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, who was Black, by a white police officer. On his latest album, \u201cLove for you,\u201d Phoenix apologizes to Higher Brothers for saying they were not speaking in support of Black Lives Matter.\n\nDuring that period, Phoenix said he saw a lack of \u201caccountability\u201d from the Asian rapping community, and \u201cas Asian rappers who made a boatload of money from Black culture, it was only right that we showed up and donated to the cause.\u201d\n\nPhoenix had called out 88Rising, a label that features Asian hip-hop artists, as well as Higher Brothers and Vava, some of the biggest names in the Chinese rapping sphere. The label later announced a donation of $60,000 in support of funds against racial inequality.\n\nPhoenix's criticism led to a rift with Higher Brothers that hasn't healed. The group told Bohan he should have reached out privately instead of writing about it online. They also said they didn\u2019t understand the situation in the U.S.\n\nBack in the U.S. during the pandemic, Phoenix donated money and marched in the streets. He also served as a moderator for a panel about Asian American support for Black Lives Matter. \u201cEverything felt really urgent,\u201d he said of the time.\n\nPhoenix said he immediately thought of his mother, and worried about her getting attacked in New York. He released a song called \u201cbut I still love you\u201d as part of a campaign #HateIsAVirus, which features people of different ethnicities dancing and singing together. Again, he spoke of Black and Asian solidarity, and of seeing everyone as human first.\n\n\u201cI know I look nothing like you, but I hope that you still love me,\u201d the crowd sings in the chorus of the song.\n\nPhoenix is clear on why he does what he does.\n\n\u201cBut my need for music isn\u2019t about money or fast cars, when I have nothing, it gives me confidence and joy,\u201d he raps in \u201cLove For You.\u201d\n\nFor now, Phoenix is focused on his work in China, in part because he wants to spend time with his grandfather. He still shuttles between the U.S. and China, and is one of the few artists who perform and attract audiences in both countries. He appears as confident in Harlem as he is in Chengdu.\n\nPhoenix is due to join the next season of a popular hip-hop competition show, Rap of China, which has brought rap to the mainstream, in the spring.\n\nTo him, China represents possibility.\n\n\u201cFor me I\u2019m confident in my music to be in the States, but being in China \u2026 I have always thought, Oh man, what would it be like to be in New York when hip-hop just got started?\" he said. \u201cTo me, China kind of feels like that. It feels like the wild, wild West.\u201d"}

The House vote on the charges, which Democrats say are untrue and hardly grounds for impeachment, is set for Tuesday.\n\nNot since 1876 has a Cabinet secretary faced impeachment charges and it's the first time a sitting secretary is being impeached \u2014 148 years ago, Secretary of War William Belknap resigned just before the vote.\n\n\u201cVery clearly Secretary Mayorkas has picked and chosen which laws he's going to enforce,\u201d said Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, at a hearing ahead of the vote.\n\nThe impeachment charges against Mayorkas come as border security is fast becoming a top political issue in the 2024 election, a particularly potent line of attack being leveled at President Joe Biden by Republicans, led by the party's front-runner for the presidential nomination, Donald Trump.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nRecord numbers of people have been arriving at the southern border, many fleeing countries around the world, in what Mayorkas calls an era of global migration. Many migrants are claiming asylum and being conditionally released into the U.S., arriving in cities that are underequipped to provide housing and other aid while they await judicial proceedings which can take years to determine if they may remain.\n\nThe House Democrats are expected to unite against the two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas, calling the proceedings a sham over charges that do not rise to the Constitution's bar of treason, bribery or \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\n\"This is a total waste of time,\u201d said Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., at Monday's hearing.\n\nThe impeachment of Mayorkas landed quickly onto the House agenda after Republican efforts to impeach Biden over the business dealings of his son, Hunter Biden, hit a lull, and the investigation into the Biden family drags.\n\nGreen\u2019s committee had been investigating the Homeland Security secretary for much of the past year, but a resolution from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a Trump ally, pushed it to the fore. The panel swiftly held a pair of hearings in January before announcing the two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas.\n\nA former federal prosecutor, the secretary never testified on his own behalf, but submitted a rare letter to the panel defending his work.\n\nTuesday's vote arrives at a politically odd juncture for Mayorkas, who has been shuttling to the Senate to negotiate a bipartisan border security package, earning high marks from a group of senators involved in the effort.\n\nThe legislation, which emerged Sunday and is heading for a test vote Wednesday, is one of the most ambitious immigration overhauls in years. But other Republicans are panning the bipartisan effort, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says it's \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d\n\nIt's not at all clear that Johnson, with one of the smallest House majorities in modern times, has the support of almost all Republicans needed to impeach Mayorkas. A few holdouts remained ahead of the scheduled vote.\n\nEven if Republicans are able to impeach Mayorkas, he is not expected to be convicted in a Senate trial where Republican senators have been cool to the effort. In fact, the Senate may simply refer the matter to a committee for its own investigation, delaying immediate action.\n\nImpeachment, once rare in the U.S., has been used as both a constitutional check on the executive but also increasingly as a political weapon.\n\nThe House Republicans have put a priority this session of Congress on impeachments, censures and other rebukes of officials and lawmakers, setting a new standard that is alarming scholars and others for the ways in which they can dole out punishments for perceived transgressions.\n\nExperts have argued that Mayorkas has been snared in a policy dispute with Republicans who disapprove of the Biden administration's approach to the border situation.\n\nConstitutional law expert Jonathan Turley said impeachment is not to be used for being \u201ca bad Cabinet member.\u201d Lawyer Alan Dershowitz wrote, \"Whatever else Mayorkas may or may not have done, he has not committed bribery, treason, or high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\n\u201cThis impeachment is exactly what impeachment was never supposed to be for,\u201d said Deborah Pearlstein, director of the Princeton Program on Law and Public Policy who testified before the panel, in an interview.\n\nTrump as president was twice impeached \u2014 first in 2019 on corruption over his phone call with the Ukrainian president seeking a favor to dig up then-rival Biden, and later on the charge of inciting the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the Capitol. He was acquitted on both impeachments in the Senate.\n\nBelknap, who was impeached over a kickback scheme in government contracts, was acquitted in the Senate trial."}

But progress has been slow, they added.\n\nTencent did not disclose its plans to develop a mobile version of the game at the time. \"Elden Ring\" was co-developed by \"Game of Thrones\" author George R. R. Martin and veteran game designer Hidetaka Miyazaki and is an action game where one battles mythical monsters in a fantasy world.\n\nThe game, released in 2022 for $60, sold about 20 million copies in its first year, making it the world's second best-selling game for the year.

Not that there is a sudden bumper crop of talented comedians in Germany, but who needs them when reality itself is already so bleakly cartoonish? A few years ago, Germany seemed like it had all the answers: a robust economy and a stable and broad-based coalition against the far right. Now, the economy is faltering as the combined effects of mismanagement collide with a bureaucratic culture that makes investment and innovation difficult. Striking rail workers and protesting farmers have brought chaos to the cities. The only thing collapsing faster than the German economy is the country\u2019s status as a moral example, which hit an all-time high with the refugee crisis of 2015-16 and has now tumbled like a vaudeville star on a banana peel.\n\nJewish critics of Israel being arrested by Berlin police for allegedly antisemitic speech? It\u2019s a joke worthy of Franz Kafka, who would also certainly have got a kick out of the enormous disparity between the treatment of protests in support of a ceasefire in Gaza and the farmers\u2019 protests and their cavalcades of tractors.\n\nWhile the former were often broken up or banned on questionable charges of antisemitism, the latter have been tolerated or even celebrated by the press and by politicians, despite evidence that in some regions, rightwing extremists and neo-Nazis have become involved in organising the expression of rural discontent. Indeed, it\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that the state is most permissive of protests organised by rightwing Germans. The same tactics that have been broadly tolerated in the context of the farmers\u2019 protests have been subject to increasingly draconian punishments when deployed by climate activists. \u201cWe\u2019re allowed,\u201d frustrated protesters wrote on a sign at one recent traffic-stopping action, where one young man sat on a toy agricultural vehicle: \u201cWe have a tractor.\u201d\n\nThe contradictions that have rendered German life such a darkly comedic goldmine are more than just a matter of political showmanship \u2013 they cut through the country\u2019s political and cultural life. Germany made massive early investments in renewable energy, for example, but it also allowed the violent clearing of an old-growth forest to expand coal mining, and continues to resist reasonable steps to reduce its dependency on cars. Unsurprisingly, peer nations have been far more successful in reducing CO2 emissions. Similarly, the country\u2019s fetish for eliminating public debt has been paired with a consistent tolerance of political corruption and tax malfeasance. Following debates about immigration policy has been like watching a ping-pong match where the country\u2019s desperate need to care for an ageing population and attract global tech workers is engaged in a dizzying rally with the race-baiting and xenophobia that have become an increasingly normal part of German political life.\n\nView image in fullscreen Public transport workers on strike in Hanover, Germany, 2 February 2024. Photograph: Michael Matthey/AP\n\nWhen politics in the US and the UK have been funny recently, it has largely been a matter of personalities \u2013 the cartoonish excesses of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, Liz Truss\u2019s panicked attempts to project an aura of calm authority, Ron DeSantis\u2019s tough guy act. Granted, that parts of the English-speaking world have been governed by such farcical figures recently is evidence of real cracks in the structure of its democracies. But in Germany, the cracks are on the surface, plain to see. Indeed, the faultlines are clear enough that the news now often seems only to confirm our suspicions. The recent revelation that members of the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) plotted the deportation of millions of people in a series of clandestine meetings with neo-Nazis, for example, is only the latest in a string of scandals revealing the extent to which far-right extremists have infiltrated German politics. Weapons thefts, coup plans, attacks on the Bundestag \u2013 rightwing extremists have found support in the halls of power. Still, it\u2019s funny that they held their meetings in a house called \u201cVilla Adlon\u201d \u2013 which sounds like a name Mel Brooks might invent for a Nazi meeting place.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to insist on this kind of comedy because it comes from the kinds of psychic conflict that Sigmund Freud identified as the very source of humour. German society is trying to protect the climate and drive big, powerful cars as fast as possible. Germany\u2019s fiscal policy wants to model fiscal responsibility but has no desire to confront the country\u2019s structural problems. Above all, the desire to atone for the crimes of the Nazis is in an increasingly desperate conflict with the reality that German society, as David de Jong and others have recently argued, was built largely by unrepentant Nazis.\n\nAnd it\u2019s important to laugh at Germany\u2019s hypocrisy today. After all, as the Jewish German philosopher Theodor Adorno famously argued, there are some atrocities so far beyond justification that earnest moral reasoning is inappropriate. When German politicians argue that police need to beat peaceful protesters to honour the legacy of the Holocaust, it would be obscene to argue with them. When German journalists try to argue that \u201ccollective responsibility\u201d for the crimes of Hamas lies with \u201cGaza\u2019s people\u201d, it would be inappropriate to dignify their arguments with a response. It\u2019s better to tell a joke.\n\nThose concerned that it is inappropriate to laugh about such very serious matters might take solace \u2013 and inspiration \u2013 in the great stock of humour left behind by the victims of nazism. Laughter in the face of catastrophe was an essential means of survival for everyone: soldiers, concentration camp inmates, resistance fighters and refugees such as Hannah Arendt, who once quipped that the only way to identify a German anti-Nazi \u201cis when the Nazis have hanged him\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Every day, she knocks on the doors of girls aged nine to 18 living in the rural, hard-to-reach areas outside Malawi\u2019s capital, Lilongwe. Her goal is to promote the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and offer reliable health information.\n\n\u201cI wish there was someone like me when I was their age. Someone I could ask questions and talk to about my health,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I was diagnosed with HIV at 15, I went into complete denial. I had no one to talk to, as my parents died long ago.\u201d\n\nCervical cancer is six times more likely to affect women living with HIV, and though many parents are eager for their children to receive the HPV vaccine, they do not have the transport to make the journey to a health clinic. Others are reluctant, having heard that the vaccine is dangerous and designed to cause infertility. It is Mzemba\u2019s job to answer their questions and address their concerns.\n\nMzemba tries to visit at least five households a day. \u201cMost of the time, if you provide parents with information, they change their mind,\u201d she says. \u201cI am local to the area, they know who I am. They trust me.\u201d\n\nMzemba works with mothers2mothers, an international NGO that promotes family health and works with HIV-positive women. It rolled out its HPV peer-mentoring scheme in Malawi last year when the government extended eligibility for the vaccine to all girls aged nine to 18, in an effort to combat the plummeting coverage rate.\n\nView image in fullscreen The HPV scheme run by mothers2mothers has reached more than 1,000 girls in Malawi by getting the team to visit villages in hard-to-reach areas. Photograph: mothers2mothers\n\nMalawi has among the world\u2019s highest HIV rates, with the prevalence rate considerably higher among women than men, and has the second-highest rate of cervical cancer mortality after Eswatini. While the global cervical cancer mortality rate is seven per 100,000 women, more than 51 women die due to the disease per 100,000 in Malawi.\n\nThe HPV vaccine is a test case. If we get it right, it can be expanded to more vaccines Edina Amponsah-Dacosta, virologist\n\nMore than 95% of cervical cancer cases are caused by HPV, which is sexually transmitted. In a UK study, the HPV vaccine was shown to prevent up to 87% of cervical cancer cases in women in their 20s who were offered it at ages 12-13. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the vaccine is given to girls aged 9-14 before they become sexually active.\n\nWhile the HPV vaccine has been available for free in Malawi since 2019, the coverage rate fell with the onset of the Covid pandemic from 83% to 14%, according to WHO data. School closures and vaccine hesitancy are to blame, say health advocates.\n\n\u201cDuring Covid we lost a decade of progress in three years in terms of global vaccination rates,\u201d says Corrina Moucheraud, a public health researcher at New York University. \u201cAnd the HPV vaccine, according to Unicef, has globally been one of the most affected. Things are changing in Malawi but it\u2019s not like we are fully back to normal, you cannot fully undo what happened over the last few years.\u201d\n\nThe key barriers to vaccinations are poor transport and misinformation, says Tendai Mayani, the senior programme manager at mothers2mothers.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Global Dispatch Free newsletter Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the areas we work in, they may live over 5km away from a health facility and not have access to transport,\u201d says Mayani. \u201cWe work by gathering parental consent for the vaccines for a group of about 20 girls, and then we arrange for a health worker to travel to the village.\u201d\n\nSince launching last year, mothers2mothers\u2019 HPV scheme has reached more than 1,000 girls. \u201cOne woman was very suspicious of the vaccine,\u201d says Mzemba. \u201cBut when she saw how many girls at her daughter\u2019s school were getting vaccinated she came to see me the next day to get more information and she consented.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of rumours going around,\u201d adds Moucheraud, who interviewed parents and guardians to understand their experiences with HPV vaccinations. \u201cMany parents said that they would trust a doctor or nurse about the vaccine, but very few have been able to have those conversations. For some hesitant parents, it may be the case of not getting trusted information from the right sources at the right time.\u201d\n\nThe results of the HPV vaccine campaign will be used to help the rollout of other newly developed adult vaccines, say experts. Edina Amponsah-Dacosta, a virologist at the University of Cape Town, says: \u201cThe HPV vaccine is a test case. If we get it right, we can establish an adult vaccination platform that can be expanded to more vaccines.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want my daughter and my family to be proud of me,\u201d says Mzemba, who has a one-year-old daughter and is working towards a public health degree. \u201cI\u2019m championing my local community, but I want to be everywhere.

The building is across the street from La Llotja, the old stock exchange building which was home to the School of Fine Arts, which the artist attended from the age of 13.\n\nMuch of what is modern Barcelona was still under construction at the time and Picasso spent most of his life in Ciutat Vella, the old town.\n\nView image in fullscreen Pablo Picasso and Olga Khokhlova. Photograph: Album/Alamy\n\nThere are several early works depicting locations within a stone\u2019s throw of La Llotja, among them the Moll dels Pescadors, the basilica of Santa Maria del Mar, Barceloneta beach and the home in Carrer de la Merc\u00e8, where the family moved in 1896.\n\nPicasso\u2019s first studio is now a restaurant and hotel in Carrer de la Plata, and the Sala Par\u00e9s in the narrow Carrer de Petritxol, where Picasso exhibited in 1901, is still in business. Then, as now, the street was famous for chocolate and pastries: Picasso and other artists would regularly pop out for supplies. Petritxol Xocoa is a good place to try them. Close by is Carrer d\u2019Aviny\u00f3, where there was a brothel (at No 44), which may be the inspiration for Picasso\u2019s early cubist work Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon. The artist\u2019s biographer, Josep Palau i Fabre, is among those who assert the title refers to the Barcelona street and not the French city. Picasso dismissed the theory, then fuelled the ambiguity by saying: \u201cYou must not always believe what I say.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon \u2013 which may have been inspired by a brothel that used to be on Carrer d\u2019Aviny\u00f3. Photograph: Tracey Whitefoot/Alamy\n\nSuch sites can be explored thanks to a new book, Picasso-Barcelona: A Cartography (Editorial Tenov SL), from which aficionados can retrace the artist\u2019s steps around the city and visit his favourite watering holes.\n\nEls Quatre Gats sought to bring the Bohemian spirit of Paris to Barcelona\n\nWritten by Claustre Rafart i Planas, a former curator at the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, the beautifully illustrated book offers a vision of Barcelona as it was then.\n\nIts eight chapters each has a map showing the locations mentioned in the text, with a key indicating whether they still exist or are open to visitors.\n\nPerhaps Picasso\u2019s most famous hangout was Els Quatre Gats, the elegant bar designed by the Catalan modernist architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch and commissioned by the artists Ramon Casas and Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol. It was inspired by the Parisian bar Le Chat Noir and sought to bring the Bohemian spirit of the French capital to Barcelona. The Catalan expression quatre gats (four cats) means \u201chardly anyone\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Picasso hangout Els Quatre Gats\n\nThere are many sites on La Rambla associated with Picasso, among them the Canaletes fountain which he sketched from memory in 1968, and the Liceu theatre and opera house, where the Russian ballet performed in 1917. The dancers stayed at the Hotel Ranzini on La Rambla, which Picasso visited often because he was infatuated with Olga Khokhlova, the dancer whom he later married, despite Picasso\u2019s mother warning her off, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t believe any woman would be happy with my son.\u201d\n\nOutside the old town, Picasso also frequented the theatres on the Avinguda Paral\u00b7lel and the bullrings of Las Arenas and La Monumental. Bullfighting is banned in Catalonia, and Las Arenas is now a shopping centre, while La Monumental, where the Rolling Stones performed in 1976, has fallen into disuse.\n\nIn 1970 Picasso donated hundreds of his works, including 236 oil paintings, to the city: they form the basis of the Museu Picasso\u2019s collection.\n\nPicasso-Barcelona: A Cartography is published to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Picasso\u2019s death.

Diane Oliver published four stories in her lifetime and two more posthumously; they are all included here along with eight stories previously unpublished.\n\nOliver\u2019s subject is the black female experience in 1960s America, in the period when racial segregation was illegal but prejudices remained ingrained \u2013 but the tales succeed for their literary qualities, not their subject matter. The title story follows a family preparing for their son to be bussed to a newly integrated \u201cwhite\u201d school and their fears both from those attacking them (should they burn abusive letters, or keep them as evidence?) and those trying to help: cruising police cars intended to reassure them just make them more nervous.\n\nOliver\u2019s techniques keep the stories varied even while the themes remain linked\n\nThe characters are not warriors for justice but ordinary people, who sometimes want a quiet life. \u201cNow sooner or later they\u2019re going to integrate everything. I know that,\u201d says the father of the family in When the Apples Are Ripe. \u201cBut sensible people with a future don\u2019t get involved.\u201d And Oliver\u2019s techniques keep the stories varied even while the themes remain linked. There\u2019s dry humour in The Closet on the Top Floor, where a black woman attends a college with white students, but rejects her mother\u2019s suggestion of joining the drama sorority because she \u201cdidn\u2019t see how she could play the maid\u2019s part for four years\u201d. In Banago Kalt, a woman visiting Switzerland is beset by fatuous demands. \u201cWas she in any danger of being lynched, they wanted to know.\u201d\n\nThe previously unpublished stories are of varying quality. No Brown Sugar in Anybody\u2019s Milk is one of the best overall, with an unexpected revelation that deepens its emotional resonance. Others, if published in Oliver\u2019s lifetime, would have benefited from an editor\u2019s hand, such as the overlong impressionistic experiment Frozen Voices, or Our Trip to the Nature Museum, an unsubtle story of a teacher involved with a black child\u2019s home life. We can only imagine what wonders Oliver might have produced had she lived, but the precocious talent on display here is cause enough for celebration."}

All hailing from Greece, the men are hired as part of counter-piracy security measures for shipping companies, whose boats traverse so-called High Risk Areas. The film, however, is not interested in macho heroism but rather, observed in a state of perpetual waiting, the men come off as passive figures, not agents of control.\n\nJust recruited, Yorgos is adapting to his new unmoored reality, in which daytime drills give way to nightclub outings in the evening. Meanwhile Costa, who is at the peak of his career, seems more at ease with the transient nature of his life. Still his days are also disrupted by phone calls from loved ones, including a girlfriend who laments his absence. For the middle-aged Victor, who is in charge of training new recruits, this life is a young man\u2019s game; he longs to transition to a more anchoring line of work that will keep him closer to his wife and son.\n\nOperating within a masculine space, the camerawork lingers on the male form \u2013 as they take a shower or engage in practice hand-to-hand combat. It\u2019s very much reminiscent of Claire Denis\u2019s Beau Travail, with sensual imagery and an air of homoeroticism that subverts the militarised atmosphere. At the same time, such visual experimentation also obscures the larger sociopolitical contexts surrounding the existence of these mercenary corps; it\u2019s apparent in the film that, while the majority of the security hires are Caucasians, the domestic staff onboard are mostly non-white workers. The thorny subjects of race and class hierarchies are here somewhat overlooked in favour of abstract imagery."}

Since then it has given nearly \u00a32bn in total, distributed via local authorities, and is used to fund food and energy vouchers, replacement furniture and white goods, and grant support for food banks.\n\nEnglish councils spent more than a third of the \u00a3850m allocated to them last year as part of the fund on food vouchers for families eligible for free school meals during the school holidays, suggesting that the removal of the HSF could also trigger a fresh holiday hunger crisis.\n\nThere is cross-party support for extending the HSF for at least a year, with Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the Conservative former welfare secretary, and Will Quince, an ex-welfare minister, among those backing a call to retain the scheme by Labour\u2019s Stephen Timms during a parliamentary debate last week.\n\nMinisters have said the decision to end the scheme is still under review, although Barnardo\u2019s has said that it would create a major deficit in crisis help that neither charities nor local authorities \u2013 many of themselves in financial crisis \u2013 would be able to fill.\n\nMore than four in five councils have reported that hardship levels have increased in their area in the past year, and nearly three-quarters expect it to continue to rise over the next 12 months, according to a Local Government Association survey. Pete Marland, the chair of the association\u2019s economy and resources board, said: \u201cWithout an urgent extension of the HSF for at least a year, there is a risk of more households falling into financial crisis, homelessness and poverty.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s cost of living payments scheme is also due to end soon, with the final payment of \u00a3299 this month. Campaigners are worried that support for low-income families will fall off a \u201ccliff edge\u201d in a few weeks at a time when food and energy and other basic living costs are still punishingly high.\n\nResearch by the charity End Furniture Poverty in November found that nearly two-thirds of local authority welfare assistance spending was financed by the HSF in 2022-23, suggesting its removal would have a disastrous impact on the availability and depth of local welfare assistance schemes, which as a result of cuts have largely declined in recent years.\n\nA freedom of information request to English councils by Barnardo\u2019s found requests for crisis help with children\u2019s beds had risen from 4,000 to 18,000 between 2018 and 2023. Over the same period, the proportion of successful applications fell from 53% to 41%.\n\nBarnardo\u2019s chief executive, Lynn Perry, said: \u201dEven with the HSF in place, councils are struggling to keep up with demand. That fund is due to end in two months\u2019 time \u2013 if it does, it will leave a huge hole in the ability of councils to provide help \u2013 including providing beds or bedding for children who deserve a decent night\u2019s sleep.\u201d\n\nA DWP spokesperson said: \u201cWe have invested over \u00a32bn in the household support fund over the last two years \u2013 with almost \u00a3800m already paid to families with children to help with the cost of living.\n\n\u201cThe current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average \u00a33,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the local housing allowance.\u201d"}

Yes, indeed it does. But don\u2019t tell them that even when they turn 18, only a few hundred thousand votes in marginal seats will swing the next election \u2013 because the system is a fix, where a postcode lottery decides the few who own the golden votes under our warped first-past-the-post electoral system.\n\nWhen young people do go to vote, this government tries to deter them by demanding photo ID at the polling station. What kind? Oh, not the kind young voters have. Young people\u2019s travel passes have been deliberately excluded, while old people\u2019s bus passes are just fine. The usually reticent chair of the Electoral Commission, John Pullinger, former chief statistician of immense civil service heft, protests loudly these days. His commission\u2019s key recommendations were ignored in the Elections Act, including this \u201cvery, very tight\u201d list of permissible IDs, that can \u201cdisenfranchise particular people\u201d, he told the Financial Times.\n\nThe commission\u2019s survey of recent non-voters in England found that photo ID requirements had deterred 4% of voters. That\u2019s significant. The old are the only age group with a majority Tory vote, and virtually no young people are Tory voters. So why has the government rejected travel pass IDs for the young? When asked this, Pullinger said: \u201cI think readers will need to draw their own judgment about that.\u201d Prosecutions for \u201cpersonation\u201d at a voting station were nonexistent at the last general election. Jacob Rees-Mogg offered an untypical service to the nation when he confessed he had voted for this \u201cgerrymander\u201d, but that it had come back to bite his own party: \u201cWe found the people who didn\u2019t have ID were elderly and they by and large voted Conservative.\u201d\n\nAnother possible attempt at gerrymandering may be an own goal. The Tories last month gave 2.2 million expats who have lived abroad for more than 15 years the right to vote: that representation without taxation was whizzed through parliament on a statutory instrument in December. As the party hires staff to register expats in key marginals and solicit donations previously barred, it may be blundering. Researchers from Sussex University found the Tories\u2019 share of overseas votes fell by two-thirds after the harm Brexit did to many of them.\n\nIf there was an ounce of sincerity in its feigned concern about voting fraud, the government would have heeded the warnings of the Association of Electoral Administrators that it will be near impossible to check the identity of long-gone expats, or penalise them for voter fraud. The Tories bodge everything, but their gerrymandering intention stinks. In Pullinger\u2019s devastating judgment, this government has opened itself up to the charge that its Elections Act is designed to benefit the Tory party. No surprise that Britain has just plunged to its lowest ever place in international rankings for perceptions of corruption in Transparency International\u2019s index, sinking from the eighth cleanest in 2012 to 18th place due to breaches of the ministerial code and opaque political donations.\n\nAh yes, dirty donations. Britain\u2019s \u201cmother of democracy\u201d reputation ratchets down as Pullinger points to the \u201ctroubling anomaly\u201d that political parties are not subject to the same anti-money-laundering regulations as businesses and charities. Among many loopholes, shadowy dining clubs, known as \u201cunincorporated associations\u201d, donated \u00a314m last year without needing to divulge who they were, Politico revealed.\n\n00:00:40 Rishi Sunak indicates he will not call election until second half of 2024 \u2013 video\n\nForeign donations can be disguised through businesses registered at Companies House. With cash for honours too ordinary for comment, no wonder Pullinger warns of the \u201csignificantly downward\u201d trend of public confidence in political finance. Liz Truss was allowed to appoint a peer for every economy-crashing 1.5 days she spent in No 10. Labour can delay the fiendishly difficult democratisation of the Lords, but still reform its worst anomalies: sack the 91 hereditary peers and 26 bishops, and make parties \u2013 and crossbenchers \u2013 cut their own numbers by 50%. They know their own dross, the non-attenders who claim expenses. It\u2019s easy to clean up peerage appointments and bar large donors.\n\nThe commission has come out fighting in protest at its lost independence: under the Elections Act, the UK no longer has an impartial elections invigilator free of the ruling party. The government has just issued the commission with its \u201cstrategy and policy\u201d marching orders, which, Pullinger says, \u201cis incompatible with the idea of an independent body\u201d. The speaker\u2019s committee declares the strategy and policy orders as \u201cnot fit for purpose and inconsistent with the commission\u2019s role as an independent regulator\u201d; the Lords has challenged these instructions and the government\u2019s right to issue them.\n\nThis power grab was sparked when the commission fell foul of Brexiters by prosecuting Vote Leave for financial rule-breaking and bungling a case against Darren Grimes. Now the act has abolished the commission\u2019s power to prosecute, rendering it toothless, hated alongside any authority able to restrain the Tories \u2013 judges, courts, regulators or human rights laws.\n\nThis matters. There is nothing to stop the government of the day directing the commission on who it investigates or stops investigating for electoral fraud or corruption. Remember, it\u2019s the commission that drafts the wording of referendums: will it now be the government instead?\n\nShamelessly, the Elections Act deliberately avoids finding the estimated 8 million voters who aren\u2019t correctly registered at their current address. How easy it would be to ensure landlords, utility companies and all officialdom added clients to the electoral register. But no need to ask why it is not done: the people less likely to be registered at their current address are the poor and the young, who move frequently. Meanwhile, the old stay put. David Cameron barred colleges and families from registering young people. Changing boundaries to match registered voters, not the actual population, unfairly gains the Tories 22 seats, according to polling guru Peter Kellner.\n\nAI and deep fakes threaten frightening distortions of election campaigns. But on its record of electoral crookedness, who would trust this government to intervene strongly if it thought it was doing it a favour? It gerrymandered the voting system for mayors and police and crime commissioners, because under the alternative vote, too few people cast Tories as their second choice. But frankly, as things stand, it looks as if no amount of gerrymandering will save its bacon."}

I don\u2019t want to be in a position where I lose by 200 votes and I think: \u2018I should have done more door-knocking.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re not complacent. An 18,500 majority in anybody\u2019s money is really difficult to overturn.\u201d\n\nIt is fair to say that the Wellingborough byelection, where constituents will vote in a replacement for Peter Bone on 15 February, is unusual in several ways.\n\nTo begin with was the manner of Bone\u2019s departure. The veteran Brexiter was ousted in a recall petition after a watchdog found he had bullied a staff member and exposed his genitals near their face, which Bone denied.\n\nThe local Conservatives then chose as their candidate a local councillor, Helen Harrison, who is Bone\u2019s relatively new partner, after his separation from his longtime wife and office secretary, Jennie \u2013 who is also a councillor, and on the same local authority.\n\nAll this, coupled with the Tories\u2019 dismal national polling status and Labour\u2019s overturning of even bigger Conservative majorities in October byelections in Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire, means Kitchen is the overwhelming favourite.\n\nA Northamptonshire local who went on to be a councillor in Newham, east London, Kitchen had become a highly visible presence in the constituency even before Bone\u2019s departure was confirmed.\n\nView image in fullscreen Gen Kitchen, right, is from Northamptonshire and went on to be a councillor in Newham, east London. Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian\n\nIn contrast, Harrison has been largely hidden from media scrutiny. Local Tories rebuffed the Guardian\u2019s request to meet her, saying she was too busy knocking on doors, talking up her status as a local and a keen and early fan of Brexit.\n\nEven ministers have been staying away, the only exceptions being Andrea Leadsom and Tom Pursglove, who have neighbouring constituencies.\n\nSome might argue that Harrison\u2019s campaign is failing even on basic optics: anyone visiting her Wellingborough HQ, hastily repurposed from Bone\u2019s constituency office, is greeted by an abandoned car dumped directly outside, its tyres flat and interior filled with rubbish.\n\nView image in fullscreen An abandoned car outside the campaign HQ of Helen Harrison. Photograph: Peter Walker/The Guardian\n\nYet another unpredictable factor is Reform UK. The Nigel Farage-formed party has put up one of its deputy leaders, the businessman Ben Habib, and hopes to show it can translate strong recent national polling into votes, something that could seriously harm the Conservatives in the general election.\n\nAs ever with the successors to Ukip, its campaigning is simultaneously energetic and somewhat freewheeling. On the day the Guardian joins it, a promised contingent of canvassers from the West Midlands has been decimated by food poisoning after an ill-fated trip to a rib restaurant. This leaves just two people, and the party\u2019s part-time press officer, to tour addresses in Rushden, near Higham Ferrers.\n\nWhat they lack in numbers they compensate for in fervour, at one point chasing Bone down the high street after he is spotted loping past carrying a clipboard. After he vanishes, one of the canvassers, a 76-year-old who wants to be known by just her first name, Ruby, talks a string of people into attending a party event featuring the former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe.\n\nView image in fullscreen Irene Yoong-Henery canvassing for the Reform UK party in Rushden. Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian\n\nSpeaking later to the Guardian, Habib said he hoped the party would do better than in Mid Bedfordshire and Tamworth, where it took 3.7% and 5.4% of the vote respectively, now that Reform is polling nationally at up to 10%.\n\n\u201cPeople then, I think, on the whole still hadn\u2019t heard of Reform,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with all the coverage we\u2019ve had over the past few months, there\u2019s a much broader recognition of who we are, and that\u2019s obviously a good thing as far as we\u2019re concerned. That level of support and recognition simply didn\u2019t exist in the last two byelections. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see if that transfers into votes on the day. I get a sense that people are angry about the state of the country.\u201d\n\nThere are a number of possible outcomes to all this, almost all of which feel unfavourable to the Conservatives, who are expected to lose another seat on the same night. Kingswood, on the edge of Bristol, lost its sitting Tory MP after the former energy minister Chris Skidmore, whose majority was 11,000, quit in dismay at the government\u2019s push to drill for new fossil fuels.\n\nAsked how they would vote on 15 February, Wellingborough constituents give different answers, but none seemed to involve definite support for Harrison.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably time for a change \u2013 I think she\u2019ll do a good job,\u201d Kenneth Horton, a retired accountant, said after chatting to Kitchen on her canvassing round. \u201cMy only problem is Keir Starmer. He doesn\u2019t impress me at all. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because he\u2019s not a very good speaker \u2013 which is surprising, considering he\u2019s a lawyer \u2013 but there seems to be no fire there. At all. Johnson was inspirational, but he was a fool to himself.\u201d\n\nJacqueline, out shopping in Wellingborough with her husband, Peter, said neither of them had yet chosen which of the 11-strong field to support. But even as a long-term Conservative voter, she had already made one decision: \u201cI know who I won\u2019t vote for: the Tories. It\u2019s mainly what has gone on locally. It\u2019s the way the new person, his partner, has got in. It\u2019s all a bit strange, isn\u2019t it?\u201d"}

He worked for Avianline Charters, one of the air taxi companies that shuttle people across Colombia\u2019s Amazon region, an expanse of rainforest roughly the size of California. The forest is dark, dense and often treacherous. There are no roads, much less commercial airports, and the meandering rivers teem with predators, including piranhas and anacondas. Violent rebel groups and drug smugglers hide out in the region.\n\nOn 1 May 2023, Murcia agreed to pilot a flight from the southern Amazon town of Araracuara to San Jos\u00e9 del Guaviare, a population centre connected to Colombia\u2019s road network. He was supposed to be carrying representatives of Yauto, a company brokering carbon credits between Indigenous populations and multinational firms, but sometime before takeoff, members of the Colombian military stationed in Araracuara approached Murcia. They told him that there was a change of plans: he needed to evacuate an Indigenous family.\n\nAs the family hurried to the rear of the plane, a blue and white Cessna, a local Indigenous leader named Herm\u00e1n Mendoza clambered up front next to Murcia; he said that he was there to ensure the other passengers arrived at their destination safely. Murcia added everyone\u2019s names to the flight manifest, radioed the information with the plane\u2019s registration number, HK2803, to Colombian air traffic control, then took off.\n\nAbout 30 minutes into the flight, as the Cessna approached the Colombian department of Caquet\u00e1, one of the densest, wettest, most remote corners of the Amazon, its engine failed. Over his radio, Murcia sent a mayday alert. To land, Murcia needed an opening in the landscape below him, but these are exceedingly rare in the Amazon. Air traffic control asked him to confirm his location.\n\n\u201cOne hundred and three miles outside San Jos\u00e9,\u201d Murcia responded. \u201cI am going to hit water.\u201d\n\nThese were the last words air traffic control heard from Murcia. Moments later, radar recorded the Cessna taking a sharp right turn. Then, about 7.50am, it disappeared.\n\nWord of the Cessna\u2019s disappearance spread quickly. By 8.15am, authorities had picked up a distress signal from the plane\u2019s emergency locator transmitter, a device triggered by impact from a crash. The Cessna appeared to be somewhere in an area of about 4 sq km, near a small community called Cachiporro along the Apaporis River.\n\nWhen a plane crashes in Colombia, the responsibility for finding it normally lies with the Civil Aviation Authority, which will arrange for the military and the air force to dispatch recovery teams. But the vast wilderness and unique dangers of the Amazon meant that it was initially deemed too risky to send anyone on foot. Only the air force was deployed, and it sent surveillance planes over the jungle near Cachiporro, hoping to spot the wreckage or possibly survivors.\n\nMeanwhile, Freddy Ladino, the founder of Avianline Charters, sent up several of his other planes to look for HK2803. But neither Avianline nor the air force saw any sign of the crash: no debris, no smoke, no conspicuous swath cut through the rainforest\u2019s canopy.\n\nBy 10.30am, the crash was making headlines. The last-minute change to the HK2803 manifest supercharged the media\u2019s interest. The Indigenous family on the flight included a woman named Magdalena Mucutuy Valencia (34) and her four young children: daughters Lesly (13), Soleiny (9) and Cristin (11 months), and son Tien (4).\n\nWithin hours of the Cessna vanishing, the fate of Magdalena and her children became an obsession in Colombia. In the weeks to come there would be breathless news segments, finger-pointing and dashed hopes. It would be 40 days until the world had answers.\n\nFor Magdalena, the jungle had always been home. A member of the Indigenous Witoto tribe \u2013 sometimes spelled Huitoto or Uitoto \u2013 she was the third of 10 siblings born to F\u00e1tima Valencia and Narciso Mucutuy. They grew up on the fringes of Araracuara, a place so remote that electricity must come from petrol generators or solar panels, and mobile phone service is only available at the small landing strip. Cocaine cartels operating nearby sometimes forcibly recruited local children to participate in illicit drug production. A rebel group calling itself the Carolina Ram\u00edrez Front was believed to be using Araracuara as a transfer point for cocaine shipments bound for Brazil.\n\nValencia, Magdalena\u2019s mother, was a village elder, and she instilled in her children a deep reverence for the forest. According to Witoto belief, everything in the Amazon, from the rivers to the plants to the animals, is imbued with a powerful spirit. Some spirits are good, others malevolent. The latter category includes duendes, which lurk in the jungle\u2019s shadows, looking to lead children astray. \u201cThey take out your voice,\u201d Valencia said, \u201cand you cannot scream.\u201d The Witoto claim to commune with jungle spirits through shamanic rituals and ceremonies.\n\nIn 2005, Magdalena fell in love with Andr\u00e9s Jacobombaire, and in 2010 they welcomed a daughter, Lesly, who inherited her mother\u2019s long brown hair and brown eyes. Lesly proved to be a natural athlete and was good at fishing. Her paternal grandfather, an Indigenous chief, taught her to hunt for monkeys. Lesly spent hours studying the sounds of birds and learning the names of trees and fruit. \u201cShe knew how to defend herself in the jungle,\u201d Jacobombaire said. \u201cWe prepared her from a very young age.\u201d\n\nFor 12 years, Magdalena and Jacobombaire had a good relationship. They had another child, Soleiny, in 2014. But in early 2017, Magdalena left with Lesly and Soleiny, and found work at an illegal mine in Araracuara, which is where she met Manuel Ranoque. A short, strong man, 26-year-old Ranoque didn\u2019t have a good reputation: some people considered him a bully who drank too much. But Magdalena fell for him, and they moved in together in the Indigenous reserve of Puerto S\u00e1balo, Ranoque\u2019s home. Magdalena gave birth to two more children, Tien and Cristin. Her mother didn\u2019t approve of Magdalena\u2019s new relationship.\n\nIn April 2023, Ranoque suddenly left the reserve. He said the Carolina Ram\u00edrez Front had threatened his life. From Bogot\u00e1, he contacted Magdalena and asked her and the children to join him. He said that they were in danger, too.\n\nMagdalena\u2019s parents told her not to follow Ranoque; they didn\u2019t trust him. So without telling her parents, Magdalena gathered her belongings and her children and moved into a little house next to the Araracuara air strip. Each day she begged Colombian soldiers to get her on a flight. The soldiers eventually agreed to secure the family seats aboard a plane leaving for San Jos\u00e9 del Guaviare, where they would be met by Ranoque, and together the family would travel by road to Bogot\u00e1.\n\nOn 1 May, after Magdalena settled on board the plane, she messaged Ranoque: \u201cWe are leaving now.\u201d As she typed, she cradled baby Cristin in her lap.\n\nAfter the crash, Magdalena\u2019s parents were shocked to learn that their daughter and grandchildren had been on the flight. As for Ranoque, when he got word about the downed Cessna, he immediately packed his bags and headed to Cachiporro. He planned to go on foot into the jungle to find his family, dead or alive.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone \u2013 other family members and friends of the missing passengers were anxious to start looking for them. In Araracuara, Herm\u00e1n Mendoza\u2019s sister and one of his cousins began rounding up volunteers for a search party. Meanwhile, Avianline organised two ground searches of its own, but one of the groups quickly became lost. They lit a fire to alert aircraft to their position and eventually stumbled on the jungle home of a man called Dumar \u2013 he didn\u2019t give his full name to the volunteers because he ran a clandestine cocaine operation.\n\nDumar\u2019s home, a wooden hut with a corrugated metal roof, became something of an informal headquarters for the civilian-led search teams. Ranoque arrived, as did Edwin Paky, another cousin of Mendoza, and the volunteers from Araracuara. The various searchers agreed to work together, and Dumar told them that on the morning of the crash, he had seen HK2083 flying over his hut, heading east at an altitude he estimated to be a few hundred feet. The next day, as the first rays of sunlight illuminated the jungle, Ranoque, Paky and other Indigenous volunteers began swinging their machetes, hacking a path through the vegetation in the direction Dumar had seen the plane go.\n\nThe military also decided to put together its own ground mission. Tasked to lead it was Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the head of Colombia\u2019s special operations joint command (CCOES), a group of highly trained soldiers who undertake the country\u2019s most dangerous and sensitive operations. S\u00e1nchez got to work drafting a search plan. The air force had spotted a plume of smoke near Cachiporro; assuming it came from a fire set by crash survivors, pilots dropped food rations nearby. Using this location as the starting point, S\u00e1nchez and his team mapped a search area of roughly 4 sq km. Only later would CCOES learn that the fire was the one set by the Avianline search team.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Amazon canopy in Colombia. Photograph: Sophie Dover/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nOn the morning of 6 May, five days after the crash, two commando groups, designated Dragon4 and Destructor1, rappelled into the jungle in the northern section of the search area. A third group dubbed Ares3 was dispatched to the banks of the Apaporis. They were accompanied by a search and rescue dog, a Belgian malinois named Wilson. Quadrant by quadrant, the CCOES soldiers did their painstaking work. They could only work from 6am until dusk, because night in the Amazon meant total darkness \u2013 the kind where a person can take a few wrong steps and find themselves lost, possibly for ever. Each man was required to walk as much as six miles a day through near-constant rain. In case there were rebels holed up nearby, the soldiers used hand signals to communicate.\n\nFamily members of the missing passengers put pressure on S\u00e1nchez to include Indigenous searchers in his operation. \u201cWe as Indigenous people know how to navigate the jungle and understand the unique spirits of each territory,\u201d Valencia said. But S\u00e1nchez resisted; he was concerned that Indigenous volunteers lacked military training and might not follow orders. Distrust ran in the other direction, too. Much of the violence between state forces and armed groups in Colombia has occurred in poor, rural areas, with Indigenous people disproportionately affected \u2013 many have been forced to flee their homes.\n\nAfter nine days and hundreds of miles of walking, the only thing the CCOES commandos had found was an abandoned camp that once belonged to members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or Farc, the notorious rebel group. Privately, Capt Ender Montiel, the leader of Dragon4, wondered whether HK2803 had sunk in the river. \u201cEvery day we would ask ourselves a lot of questions,\u201d he said.\n\nThen, early on the morning of 15 May, Dragon4 was searching its latest quadrant when Sgt Wilmar Miranda, Montiel\u2019s deputy, spotted something pink amid the foliage. It was a baby bottle. The soldiers took a photograph and sent it to S\u00e1nchez, who forwarded it to Valencia. She recognised the bottle right away. It belonged to Cristin.\n\nA few hours later, Miranda spotted some wild fruit with fresh bite marks on it, human ones. \u201cIt was happiness and joy to see that,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThere was life.\u201d He looked around for signs of trails, spots where human feet might have left prints in the soil. But the forest\u2019s unrelenting rain meant that everything was washed clean.\n\nSeveral miles south of where the CCOES was working, civilian rescuers weren\u2019t having any luck. Edwin Paky, whose navigation skills had made him the unofficial leader of the Indigenous volunteers, was growing anxious. He had injured his leg, and the group was running low on supplies.\n\nThen, on the afternoon of 15 May, one of the searchers spotted something blue through a cluster of trees: it was the plane. HK2803 was in a vertical, nose-down position on the forest floor. The Cessna\u2019s broken fuselage stuck out of the ground like a flagpole and the propeller had snapped off. Paky saw that the canopy, 45 metres above the wreckage, was somehow unbroken. No wonder aircraft had failed to spot the crash site.\n\nAs he approached the plane, Paky felt an ache in his stomach. \u201cAt first I thought nobody could have survived that crash,\u201d Paky said. He jotted down the coordinates of the site and went in search of help. He soon encountered some of the CCOES soldiers. They radioed the discovery through to S\u00e1nchez, who ordered Montiel\u2019s men in Dragon4 to the wreckage. En route the following morning, Montiel\u2019s team came across a crude shelter made of leaves freshly cut with scissors, which were lying nearby on the ground.\n\nAt the crash site, Montiel and his men lifted HK2803 up with a winch and found three bodies. Though Magdalena\u2019s remains were mostly bones, Montiel identified her by her long hair and body shape. He recognised Murcia because of his pilot\u2019s jacket. Mendoza was in the crushed nose of the plane.\n\nThe searchers noted that the cabin door was open; bags, clothes, and diapers were strewn about on the ground. Montiel realised it was possible that all the children had survived.\n\nView image in fullscreen The wreckage of HK2083. Photograph: Colombian army/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen Ranoque arrived at the scene he wept. \u201cThe only thing I thought was that that accident was my fault,\u201d he said. He was also convinced that the children were alive. But they could have been injured in the crash, and if they had wounds, infection was a real threat.\n\nThere were many others dangers. When she got word that her grandchildren might have survived the crash, Valencia thought of all the things that could have harmed or killed them in the days since: jaguars, snakes and duendes. \u201cThat jungle doesn\u2019t belong to us,\u201d she said.\n\nS\u00e1nchez estimated that if the children were alive, they had another three days, maybe four. It was time for a new search and rescue strategy. The military called the effort Operation Hope. More troops and dogs were brought to the search area. Aircraft flew low, dropping food, lighters and thousands of leaflets printed with survival tips. Pilots scanned the landscape with binoculars, searching for signs of life.\n\nS\u00e1nchez thought it was possible that the children had heard or even seen his soldiers, but were so scared of armed strangers that they hid. He suggested that someone in the family record a message telling them that it was safe to come out. Valencia made a recording on her phone. The military then attached a loudspeaker to a helicopter and flew over the jungle playing the message. \u201cI beg you, stay calm,\u201d Valencia\u2019s voice boomed over the trees. \u201cThe army is looking for you.\u201d\n\nOn 17 May, two soldiers from Destructor1 spotted a group of men in the jungle. The soldiers readied their weapons. If these were rebels or drug smugglers, violence was likely. But the men were the Indigenous searchers from Araracuara, Ranoque among them. He asked to use the soldiers\u2019 satellite phone and called a fortune-teller, who told him that if he headed west from his location for 245 metres, he would find a trail that would lead to the children. Capt Juan Felipe Montoya, the leader of Destructor1, was sceptical, but as Ranoque and the Indigenous searchers headed out of the military camp, he decided it couldn\u2019t hurt to send a few of his own men along. A short time later, the group returned with news: they had found footprints.\n\nMontoya decided to continue working with the Indigenous volunteers. Another development soon followed: Montiel\u2019s Dragon4 team found prints, too \u2013 fresh ones. The children had to be close.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all good news on 17 May, however. That evening Wilson, the Belgian malinois dog accompanying the Ares3 soldiers, chewed through his collar and ran into the jungle. He was declared missing, and all units were asked to be on the lookout for him.\n\nMeanwhile, the Institute of Family Welfare, Colombia\u2019s child-protection agency, released a statement on X, formerly Twitter, announcing that it had received information \u201cconfirming contact\u201d with the children. President Gustavo Petro tweeted that the children had been rescued \u2013 he described it as a \u201cjoy for the country\u201d. None of this was true. It isn\u2019t clear where the rumours began; perhaps it was inevitable that, amid the frantic, disjointed rescue efforts, misinformation would sprout somewhere.\n\nPetro retracted his tweet later that day, but his announcement had caught the global media\u2019s attention. Journalists from CNN, the New York Times and other outlets descended on Colombia to document the rescue mission in real time.\n\nBy then, S\u00e1nchez was getting frustrated. There were numerous signs that the children were alive, but his men still hadn\u2019t found them. On 19 May, he readied more troops and revised the required search patterns \u2013 each soldier would have to walk much farther each day.\n\nS\u00e1nchez also found himself wondering if native customs were the missing ingredients after all. Valencia was telling reporters that a duende must have captured the children, and S\u00e1nchez decided to consult an Indigenous woman he knew about the matter. He asked what might a person do about a duende. The woman gave Sanchez instructions for a ritual involving bottles of alcohol arranged beside the river at night. S\u00e1nchez dispatched the order to Montiel. \u201cI\u2019m a Catholic, so I don\u2019t believe in those things,\u201d Montiel said. Still, he did as he was told.\n\nView image in fullscreen Indigenous people and a member of the military during the search. Photograph: Juan Barreto/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe ritual didn\u2019t yield results, but it marked the start of closer collaboration between the military and Indigenous searchers. On Montoya\u2019s team, the soldiers initially slept with their guns by their sides at night, fearing Ranoque and the other civilians who had joined their camp might turn on them. But soon they were learning things from their Indigenous counterparts: how to drink water from tree roots, for instance, and build makeshift shelters from palm leaves. The volunteers\u2019 ability to spot things out of place in the jungle \u2013 human tracks, say, or the remnants of food packaging \u2013 was remarkable. They chewed mamb\u00e9, or crushed coca leaves, to sharpen their minds and give them energy, and some of the soldiers started using it, too.\n\nOn 21 May, S\u00e1nchez received a visit from Giovani Yule, a nationally respected Indigenous figure. The men hugged, and Yule told S\u00e1nchez that it was surely the first time in history that an Indigenous leader had embraced a Colombian general. President Petro had requested Yule\u2019s help in rounding up additional volunteers to help with the search, and Yule summoned members of various tribes: the Nukak, the Siona, the Nasa and the Witoto. S\u00e1nchez agreed to dispatch military aircraft to pick up the new volunteers and bring them to the search zone.\n\nOne of the new recruits was Eliecer Mu\u00f1oz, a 49-year-old farmer and a member of the Indigenous Guard, a network of volunteers who protect tribal territory from violence and environmental destruction. Jos\u00e9 Rubio, a 55-year-old shaman, also joined the search. Tall and handsome, with a steely demeanor, Rubio was often consulted when Indigenous people were lost in the jungle.\n\nBy 24 May, a total of 92 Indigenous volunteers had joined the 113 soldiers assigned to the search mission. S\u00e1nchez divided them into a dozen combined units. He ordered some of his soldiers to allow the volunteers to lead search efforts according to their beliefs.\n\nMu\u00f1oz and Rubio were both placed with Montoya\u2019s men in the Destructor1 group. Mu\u00f1oz headed to the crash site and conducted a cleansing ritual, burning sweet grass, cedar and sage to assure Mother Earth that the volunteers were only there to claim what was rightfully theirs. He also asked for better weather, to make the search easier. For the next three days there was no rain; the sky was a beautiful, rich blue.\n\nRubio consumed mamb\u00e9 and ambil, a thick tobacco paste used in Indigenous medicine \u2013 he hoped doing so would help him connect with the jungle\u2019s spirits. \u201cI asked them if it was OK for me to search for the kids, explaining that they were my family,\u201d he said. Rubio soon came to the same conclusion as Valencia: the children were being held captive by a duende.\n\nOver the next few days, the men turned up new clues: diapers, a pair of running shoes, more footprints. But no one found the children. On 26 May, the day Cristin turned one, the searchers sang Happy Birthday to her, wherever she was.\n\nMay turned to June. The children had been missing for a month. Many Indigenous volunteers were injured or severely ill, and some abandoned the search. By now some of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s commandos had walked more than 1,000 miles, and they too were exhausted.\n\nOn 4 June, Montoya and his men were preparing for an eight-day break. Moments before they boarded a helicopter, Rubio asked them to get him some yag\u00e9, a powerful psychoactive brew commonly known as ayahuasca. According to Witoto belief, consuming yag\u00e9 allows access to ancient wisdom that can solve complex problems. Rubio suspected that this was the only way the searchers could secure the children\u2019s release from the duende.\n\nIt was an unusual request. \u201cBut in this mission,\u201d Montoya said, \u201ceverything was a possibility.\u201d He agreed to have yag\u00e9 delivered to the searchers.\n\nOn 9 June, Rubio drank the yag\u00e9 and hallucinated for about 45 minutes. In his visions, he met the children and the duende who was with them. Rubio told the duende that he was there to take the children, and it agreed to return them on the condition that a spell be cast on the searchers. As Rubio sobered up, several of the Indigenous volunteers reported feeling flu-like symptoms, including body aches and high temperatures. He was sure that the ritual had worked, and he told the remaining searchers that they would find the children that day.\n\nAs the sun rose, Mu\u00f1oz set out with renewed conviction. He was joined by three other volunteers: Dairo Kumariteke, Edwin Manchola and Nicol\u00e1s Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. The men searched all day. They considered turning back at dusk, but they trusted Rubio\u2019s words. Ten minutes later they reached a clearing, and Kumariteke heard something nearby. He stopped and told the group to be still. Moments later he heard it again: the faint but unmistakable whimper of a baby.\n\nExactly 40 days after the children disappeared in the wilderness, the first person to set eyes on them was Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. He ran toward Lesly and Soleiny, shouting that he and the other volunteers knew their family. When the men finally managed to corral the girls, one of them was clutching Cristin. \u201cWhere is your little brother?\u201d Mu\u00f1oz asked. Lesly pointed at a makeshift shelter nearby. Inside, five-year-old Tien was lying on the ground, too frail to stand. \u201cMy mom is dead,\u201d he said with tears in his eyes.\n\nThe children were painfully thin and covered with scratches and insect bites. They sobbed and tried to pull away from the men. \u201cWe are family. We were sent by your father, your grandmother,\u201d Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez said. Finally, Lesly hugged him. He wrapped his arms around her tightly and told her not to be afraid.\n\nView image in fullscreen The children as they were discovered. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nNight was falling quickly, and it would take a few hours to get back to camp. Each man put a child on his back and moved as fast as he could through the jungle. Mu\u00f1oz found reserves of energy he didn\u2019t know he had. \u201cThe excitement was so overwhelming that I completely forgot about everything else,\u201d he said.\n\nFinally, the group reached their destination. \u201cI\u2019ve found the children!\u201d Mu\u00f1oz shouted.\n\nYeison Bonilla, a military sergeant, heard him, and his troops hurried to wrap the children in thermal blankets and checked them over. Bonilla didn\u2019t think they would have survived another day on their own.\n\nSome of the troops took photos of the children to send to their superiors, and a volunteer ran to find Ranoque. He rushed to the children. \u201cI felt like life was giving me a second chance to see my children alive,\u201d he said. He worried that they were too fragile to touch, so he stood nearby as Rubio blew tobacco smoke over them, to cleanse away any lingering jungle spirits.\n\nMeanwhile, Bonilla grabbed his radio and repeated the code word for a successful operation, the one everyone had waited so long to hear: \u201cMiracle, miracle, miracle.\u201d\n\nS\u00e1nchez cried when he heard Bonilla\u2019s words. He checked the coordinates of where the children were found \u2013 it was a little over three miles from the crash site. Rescue teams had almost certainly passed within yards of them, likely more than once.\n\nBy 8pm on 9 June, a Black Hawk helicopter was hovering over the children and their rescuers, its rotors spinning just feet above the treetops in the pouring rain. The vegetation was too dense to land, so the pilot, Juli\u00e1n Novoa, held the chopper steady for nearly an hour as soldiers rappelled down to the jungle floor and hoisted up the children and Ranoque one by one.\n\nOn board, doctors monitored the children as Novoa flew to the military base in San Jos\u00e9 del Guaviare, the town where the Cessna had been headed when it crashed. There the children were hooked up to IVs and then loaded on to a military plane bound for Bogot\u00e1. On the plane, Ranoque was finally able to give his children a hug. S\u00e1nchez was there, too, and Ranoque asked him to be Cristin\u2019s godfather. S\u00e1nchez accepted.\n\nView image in fullscreen Members of the Colombian army checking one of the four children before transporting them to hospital. Photograph: Colombian air force/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn a hastily convened press conference, President Petro lauded the children\u2019s \u201ctotal survival\u201d. He credited the unlikely collaboration of the military and Indigenous communities for the rescue. \u201cHere a different path is shown for Colombia,\u201d he wrote later on X.\n\nThe day after their arrival in the capital, the children were allowed to receive visitors at the hospital where they were recovering. When S\u00e1nchez came by, they were all sleeping, except Lesly. \u201cYou are brave,\u201d he told her. The children were pale, and Lesly wasn\u2019t talking, but at least they were alive.\n\nValencia said she was so overwhelmed when she visited the children in the hospital that she fainted. \u201cSeeing them in that state, suffering, without eating, exhausted, malnourished, covered in lice and thorns \u2013 it broke my heart,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Lesly and Soleiny\u2019s biological father, Andr\u00e9s Jacobombaire, came to visit, his daughters didn\u2019t recognise him \u2013 it was the first time they\u2019d seen him since their parents split up six years prior. Jacobombaire explained who he was, and Lesly burst into tears. \u201cI gave her a hug and started crying with her,\u201d he said.\n\nMedia weren\u2019t allowed to see or talk to the children, and as of this writing, that remains the case. But to family and friends interviewed for this story, the children relayed the details of their survival.\n\nAs they waited to board HK2083 on the morning of 1 May, the children were nervous \u2013 they had never flown before. But they were also happy. Lesly and Soleiny had told friends how excited they were to go to Bogot\u00e1. Magdalena had told her children that rebels were looking for the family, but soon, she assured them, they would all be safe.\n\nAn hour later, as the engine sputtered and the plane began to go down, Magdalena told her crying children to hold on tight. When the Cessna hit the canopy, Lesly banged her head and lost consciousness. When she came to, she could hear Cristin screaming. She saw that Magdalena was still holding the baby. \u201cMama! Mama!\u201d Lesly yelled over and over. Magdalena was motionless, and her eyes were rolled back in her head.\n\nLesly unbuckled her seatbelt and wrenched Cristin from her mother\u2019s arms. She used one of the baby\u2019s diapers to stem the flow of blood coming from her head. The smell of fuel filled her nostrils. Debris was scattered everywhere. Lesly saw that Herm\u00e1n Mendoza and Hernando Murcia were dead, but that Soleiny and Tien were unharmed.\n\nWith Cristin in her arms, Lesly led Soleiny and Tien out of the plane. A few yards away, she built a makeshift camp, stringing up a towel and a mosquito net. Tien kept asking when their mother would wake up. Lesly worried that her brother was too young to grasp the concept of death, so she said she didn\u2019t know.\n\nLesly knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before predators arrived, attracted by the bodies. So she gathered some of Magdalena\u2019s clothes, some farina she found in Mendoza\u2019s bag, and juice, soda and candy from elsewhere on the plane. She salvaged a few other items that seemed useful: scissors, a first aid kit, nappies, a baby bottle. Then she led her siblings west, using the sun as their guide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Soldiers of the Colombian air force give medical attention inside a plane to the surviving children. Photograph: Colombian air force/Reuters\n\nThe fact that it was the wet season in Colombia was a blessing. As they walked, Lesly collected rainwater in an empty bottle. The moisture also meant that the jungle was in full bloom, with fruit heavy and ripe on the trees. The children consumed juan soco, similar to passion fruit, as well as seeds from a palm tree called milpeso. Lesly chewed the hard seeds in her mouth, then fed the pulp to Tien and Cristin. She also gave Cristin water mixed with the farina from the plane.\n\nThe children moved locations every few days and hid in tree trunks to get out of the punishing rain. Lesly and Soleiny took turns carrying Cristin. Once, a poisonous snake came close to Lesly, and she killed it with a stick. She was desperate to find help, but she never saw a trail that might lead to civilisation, and eventually became disoriented.\n\nWhen they needed rest, Lesly sometimes made a shelter from branches bound together with hair ties. She used the scissors to cut the branches; after she lost the scissors, she used her teeth. At some point, the children found one of the emergency supply packages the military had airdropped, but most of the time they were hungry. At night they were also cold. When her siblings cried in pain, Lesly could only forage for food or wrap them in a piece of dirty fabric.\n\nDespite the hardship, Lesly said that she wasn\u2019t scared \u2013 not until she heard her grandmother\u2019s voice. It was loud, and she didn\u2019t understand where it was coming from. After that she sometimes heard soldiers in the jungle. But Lesly didn\u2019t trust men with guns. Her mother had warned her that rebels were threatening the family. When rescuers came near, the children ran away or hid. If she was holding Cristin, Lesly put a hand over the baby\u2019s mouth to muffle her cries.\n\nThe children kept moving for a few weeks, hoping to find help from locals who didn\u2019t carry guns, but by the middle of May their strength had waned. Then, as the children later told Valencia, a dog showed up. It stayed with them for several days; the children felt like it was protecting them. Then it vanished into the jungle again.\n\nIn the hospital, using crayons, Lesly drew a picture of the dog sitting under a tree next to a river, waving its paw as a yellow bird flies overhead. Soleiny drew a picture of the dog, too. In both images the animal is black and brown, with pointy ears. To the military it looked like Wilson, the missing search and rescue dog. Wilson became a hero overnight, figuring prominently in news stories about the rescue.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the children imagined the dog. Malnourishment and fatigue can play tricks on the mind. Lesly said that she started to lose her mental faculties and felt her memories evaporating.\n\nEventually, exhaustion prevented them from travelling any further. They huddled in one of the shelters Lesly built and prepared to die. When Lesly heard footsteps nearby, she was so depleted it was a struggle to breathe. Still, she was afraid and remained silent. Soleiny and Tien did, too. If Cristin hadn\u2019t whimpered, the children might never have been found.\n\nFew things in recent memory have brought Colombia\u2019s population together like the success of Operation Hope. President Petro, who is a leftist, and Iv\u00e1n Duque, his conservative predecessor, both tweeted in celebration. Even the Carolina Ram\u00edrez Front issued a rare statement: \u201cLike all Colombians, we rejoice that the four surviving children of the plane crash [in] May have been found alive.\u201d\n\nPetro invited military and Indigenous members of the rescue operation to the presidential palace to receive awards for their exceptional service. The government\u2019s highest honour went to S\u00e1nchez for his leadership. Wilson the dog was given a medal in absentia. Despite a month-long search effort by the military, he was never found.\n\nAt his home in Bogot\u00e1, Montoya keeps a bag of mamb\u00e9 from Eliecer Mu\u00f1oz and other Indigenous volunteers. \u201cWe figured out that we have a lot of things in common,\u201d Montoya said.\n\nView image in fullscreen The children and members of the rescue team after finding the children in the jungle. Photograph: Presidency/Reuters\n\nMu\u00f1oz is now close friends with Montoya\u2019s deputy, Sgt Juan Carlos Rojas; they talk on the phone and meet for dinner when they\u2019re both in Bogot\u00e1. \u201cOur traditions, thoughts, experiences, religions may be different,\u201d Rojas told me, \u201cbut in the end we united.\u201d\n\nLesly, Soleiny, Tien, and Cristin were discharged from the hospital on 14 July, just over a month after the rescue. By then the world was clamouring to hear their story. Film producers and agents were flocking to Colombia seeking access. The government created a trust for the children to manage any money generated by the attention.\n\nA version of this story scripted for Hollywood might end here. But as the kids recovered from their ordeal, a legal battle erupted over their future. Ranoque announced that he wanted custody of Tien and Cristin, his biological children, but Magdalena\u2019s parents insisted that all four kids should be placed in their care because they considered Ranoque dangerous. \u201cMy daughter died because of him,\u201d Valencia told me. Narciso Mucutuy, Valencia\u2019s husband, accused Ranoque of beating his family, telling reporters that the children sometimes fled into the jungle when the violence got particularly bad.\n\nJournalists from the Colombian television network Caracol travelled to Puerto S\u00e1balo to investigate the allegations, and they discovered a story about the events leading up to the crash that was different from the one Ranoque had told. Locals said that in April, Ranoque had flown to Bogot\u00e1, where he met up with his ex-wife and brought her back to the Amazon with him. Magdalena was devastated, and locals were appalled \u2013 by Ranoque\u2019s behaviour in Bogot\u00e1 and by his treatment of his family.\n\nOne evening, according to community leader William Castro, who has known Ranoque for years, Magdalena confronted Ranoque about the situation with his ex, and he responded by attacking her with a machete. \u201cShe had many scars from the fight,\u201d Castro told me. Elders came up with a punishment for Ranoque: he would consume a large amount of ambil, which in high doses can cause dizziness, nausea and even death. If he survived, it was because the ambil had cleansed him of evil; if he died, it would be just punishment.\n\nAccording to this account, rather than test his luck, Ranoque fled Puerto S\u00e1balo, claiming that the Carolina Ram\u00edrez Front was after him. The rebel group eventually denied threatening Ranoque and insisted that he retract his claim, lest it disrupt peace negotiations with the government. Castro told me that the idea that Ranoque or his family were being targeted by rebels was \u201ctotally false\u201d.\n\nOver the summer, Colombian authorities investigated Ranoque and uncovered more information related to potential domestic violence. In August, Ranoque was arrested on suspicion of sexual abuse. Legal documents also detail the alleged machete attack, during which Magdalena reportedly had Cristin in her arms.\n\nRanoque remains incarcerated and is awaiting trial. Writing to me from prison, he reiterated that rebels were after him, and he denied the machete attack and the allegations of sexual abuse. \u201cA father who rapes his family does not do what I did,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had something to hide, I would have let them rot in the jungle, but I was the first person who tried to look for them.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the custody dispute, which also came to include Jacobombaire, who wants to take his two daughters home with him, the Institute of Family Welfare decided to keep the children in its care for the time being. A decision on their future is expected in spring.\n\nAccording to family members and rescuers who\u2019ve seen the children, they\u2019re getting stronger every day. Cristin has started walking. Tien enjoys playing with Lego. Soleiny and Lesly are being homeschooled.\n\nStill, their sense of loss and dislocation is palpable. S\u00e1nchez and his family visited the children in December to bring them Christmas gifts. Afterwards, S\u00e1nchez told me that the kids are in good hands but miss the Amazon. \u201cThey would prefer to be eating farina and living in Araracuara,\u201d S\u00e1nchez told me.\n\nValencia believes that when Magdalena died, nature filled the void she had left in her children\u2019s lives, sustaining and protecting them until the moment they were set free by the spirit that had captured them. No matter who wins custody of the children, they will probably return to the Amazon. As it was for Magdalena, the jungle is for ever their home."}

The former X Factor contestant, Celebrity Big Brother winner, Radio 2 DJ, This Morning presenter, Gogglebox regular, podcaster and author couldn\u2019t be more clear about the distinction. Rylan is OTT, supremely camp, larger than life \u2013 the man who hysterically wept a show\u2019s worth of tears when Nicole Scherzinger put him through to the live finals of The X Factor in 2012. This is the Rylan whose dream was to be famous. And then there is Ross \u2013 quieter, super-smart, capable of trouncing politicians in debate and allergic to the idea of celebrity.\n\nWith such polarities, perhaps it was inevitable Clark would run into trouble. And sure enough he did. After finishing fifth on The X Factor, he became a TV fixture. He never stopped working. Then, three years ago, he had a breakdown from which he never expected to recover. But he has done \u2013 with style, and a huge amount of support from the public.\n\nThese days, there is still a distinction between Rylan and Ross. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see Rylan sitting there with no makeup on, with a beer in one hand and the other hand down his pants just to keep warm, watching the football. That\u2019s what Ross does,\u201d he says. But the two are getting closer. The pizazz of Rylan alongside the integrity of Ross makes for a formidable and foul-mouthed combination.\n\nWe meet at a central London hotel. Clark is dressed from head to toe in black \u2013 hair, beard, polo neck, trousers, shoes, the works. He could be a male model or a Doctor Who baddie. As a kid, he was an unconfident redhead, burdened with issues. I ask what he likes to be called: Rylan or Ross? \u201cWhatever you prefer,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat does he prefer? \u201cBaby!\u201d\n\nClark was the ultimate Marmite X Factor contestant. He had plenty of fans, and perhaps even more haters. In 2013, on Celebrity Big Brother, which he won, he had another tearful episode. \u201cI\u2019ve had worse press than Jimmy fucking Savile,\u201d he claimed. \u201cI even had death threats sent to my hotel and 24/7 security.\u201d It wasn\u2019t much of an exaggeration. Sure, he didn\u2019t have the greatest voice, but the level of hatred directed at him was shocking. And that wasn\u2019t the worst of it. It\u2019s only today that I discover the full extent of what he went through on The X Factor.\n\nView image in fullscreen On X Factor Live in 2012. Photograph: Ken McKay/Thames/Shutterstock\n\nWe are meeting to discuss a new Prime Video reality show, Hot Mess Summer. The concept is brutal and compelling: a bunch of spoilt, lazy narcissists are taken to the Greek island of Zante, thinking they are about to participate in a reality show for party animals. \u201cThey are all liabilities,\u201d Clark says. \u201cThey are selfish, so self-centred \u2026 I\u2019m trying to think of nice words that aren\u2019t derogatory, but they were everything you don\u2019t want on a night out.\u201d\n\nI try to help out. They\u2019re arseholes, aren\u2019t they? He smiles. \u201cYeah! They\u2019re that arsehole on a night out. That\u2019s exactly who they are.\u201d When they get to Zante, they are told that rather than spending the summer drinking at the bar they\u2019ll be working behind it. So far, so nasty. But it gets worse.\n\nThey are then shown videos in which their friends say why they have volunteered them for the show \u2013 because they ruin nights out, they\u2019ve never done a day\u2019s work, they don\u2019t think of anyone but themselves, and on it goes. The contestants watch the videos open-mouthed, horrified by their friends\u2019 betrayal. It\u2019s a wonder that only one threatens to leave the show. But gradually Clark wins them over: he tells them the show could make them better people, that they will learn new skills and values, and best of all there is a pot of money to be won at the end. Ultimately, they all decide to stay.\n\nWhat would have happened if they\u2019d refused to take part? \u201cThe worry was that none of them would want to do it and from a duty-of-care point of view we would have stopped the production there and then. We would have booked eight flights home \u2013 thank you, everyone; sorry, guys, we\u2019ve not got a show to make; let\u2019s stay for a couple of days, lap up a bit of the beach and go home. But the risk paid off.\u201d\n\nAnd if the contestants had been seriously traumatised by the experience? \u201cOh my God, I\u2019ve worked on reality shows for 12 years now. And from being a contestant myself I\u2019ve seen the change in duty of care. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s priority now.\u201d\n\nWhenever Clark has been asked about his time on X Factor in the past, he has been generally positive about the support system that was in place. But he\u2019s never told the full story. As he tells me now, he has never been in a position to.\n\nClark, who grew up in Essex, was 23 when the show started. He had been a bright child who went to one of the country\u2019s best state schools, and left with a stash of GCSEs. He\u2019s not sure how many exactly, he says \u2013 somewhere between 12 and 15. Despite his academic prowess, he was unhappy: bullied for his campness until he decided to fight back, and an eternal outsider. He didn\u2019t bother with A-levels, and went off to Ibiza to perform in Take That and Westlife tribute bands.\n\nAnd then came The X Factor. He says he knew what he was up to \u2013 they always want a joke act, so he hammed it up to the max. He looked as if he was having the time of his life, and he was to an extent. But there was also something else going on. He and fellow contestant Lucy Spraggan were portrayed as trouble-makers, with the press reporting unauthorised breakouts from the luxury London hotel where they were being housed. One night, as apparent punishment, they were exiled to a hotel away from the other contestants. In the next episode Spraggan was absent. We were told she was sick. She then left the show.\n\nLast year Spraggan wrote a memoir in which she revealed what actually happened. That night a hotel porter broke into her room and raped her, after she had passed out following a drunken night out with Clark celebrating his birthday. The porter was later jailed after admitting the crime. In her book, Spraggan reveals how supportive Clark was. Although the production team called the police and an arrest was quickly made, she suggested they were \u201cunprepared\u201d to deal with what had happened.\n\nI have also heard that Spraggan\u2019s legal team believes Clark played a vital role in securing the conviction. It was Clark who preserved the scene, prevented others from entering the room before the police got there, and gave impressive evidence about what had happened, despite being the worse for wear.\n\nWhen I mention this to Clark, he is surprised that I know about it. \u201cThis is so weird we\u2019re having this conversation because for 11 years I\u2019ve kept it all quiet.\u201d He starts to dab his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m getting emotional. That was a really, really tough time. It was horrendous and I\u2019ve still not spoken about it because it\u2019s not my story to tell, even though I was part of it.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian\u2019s Saturday magazine, last year, Spraggan told Joe Stone why she had finally decided to go public about the rape. \u201cFor years I was terrified of being known as the girl that that happened to. I was deeply, chronically ashamed. Now I understand that what happened wasn\u2019t my decision \u2013 it was out of my hands. And in order for me to rebuild myself and move on, I needed to tell the truth.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Clark and Spraggan in 2012, the year they became The X Factor\u2019s \u2018wild childs\u2019. Photograph: Niki Nikolova/FilmMagic\n\n\u201cLucy called me,\u201d Clark recalls, \u201cand said, \u2018I\u2019m going to put it in the book.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019ll support you if you want to do that. Whatever you want to do, we do that.\u2019\u201d Clark says he\u2019s going to check in with Spraggan, after our interview, to make sure she\u2019s happy with him talking about the attack.\n\nIt says a lot about your character, I tell him, that you acted so responsibly that day. \u201cThank you. As a 24-year-old \u2013 it was the night of my birthday \u2013 to wake up to your friend saying, \u2018I was raped last night,\u2019 while being on the biggest show in the country, while being followed by the press wherever you go \u2026 I don\u2019t know how I did it. I don\u2019t know what happened. Lucy calls me Jessica Fletcher because I came over all Angela Lansbury.\u201d\n\nIn what way? \u201cThe first thing I did was say to one of the researchers, \u2018Go and get the bosses,\u2019 and they said, \u2018They\u2019re busy,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Go and fucking get them!\u2019 I think it\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve ever spoken to somebody like that.\u201d\n\nHow did he preserve the crime scene? \u201cI said, \u2018You need to call the hotel and tell them you don\u2019t want the room cleaned.\u2019 And they were like, \u2018What d\u2019you mean?\u2019 and I was, \u2018Don\u2019t \u2026 fucking \u2026 tell them \u2026 what\u2019s happened. Just tell them you don\u2019t want the room cleaned \u2013 you\u2019re working in there. Say that.\u2019 If someone goes in that room and it\u2019s cleaned, we\u2019re fucked: that was my first thought. I became like a crime detective and I don\u2019t know why that was.\u201d He laughs, still dabbing away the tears.\n\nA few minutes later he was doing a recording session with Robbie Williams. \u201cI knew I had to carry on. That Saturday Lucy was having a week off for \u2018illness\u2019 and they said to me, \u2018If you want we\u2019ll give you this Saturday off too,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I can\u2019t because if we both take this Saturday off, the two \u201cwild childs\u201d of X Factor, she\u2019s going to get shit and she can\u2019t have that right now.\u2019\n\n\u201cI went out and during that performance if you watch it back, halfway through I go, \u2018This one\u2019s for you, Spraggan.\u2019 I knew she was watching back at the apartment. She then had to quit because she had to go for treatment, and I had to carry on.\u201d\n\nDoes he think if something like this happened today, production teams would be better equipped to deal with it? \u201cThat\u2019s a really difficult question because back then no one expected any of us to get raped on the show. There was a lot that could have been improved. I think everyone learned loads from those kind of mistakes, but I don\u2019t think it was anyone\u2019s fault other than the man who raped Lucy.\u201d\n\nI had to get up in front of 12 million people singing Madonna while I\u2019m dealing with that. I hope you feel ashamed of yourselves\n\nSpraggan has said that moving her and Clark to another hotel made them more vulnerable. He nods. \u201cI don\u2019t think that should have happened. We didn\u2019t have as much security as we were used to. Me and Lucy have had this conversation for years because we\u2019re the only two who can talk to each other about it.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for The X Factor says: \u201cTo our knowledge, the assault was an event without precedent in the UK television industry. While we believed throughout that we were doing our best to support Lucy in the aftermath of the ordeal, as Lucy thinks we could have done more, we must therefore recognise this. For everything Lucy has suffered, we are extremely sorry. Since then, we have done our very best to learn lessons from these events and improve our aftercare processes.\u201d\n\nClark is still emotional \u2013 about what happened to Spraggan, their friendship and the public hostility towards him back then. \u201cA lot of people were judging me when I was on The X Factor. Prick. Idiot. And I suppose from a selfish point of view all these years on, someone reading this, I\u2019m like, \u2018Fuck you, you bastard. You had no fucking idea. You. Had. No. Fucking. Idea. I had to get up on stage in front of 12 million people singing fucking Madonna while dressed as a drag queen while I\u2019m dealing with that. I hope you feel ashamed of yourselves, you bastards.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe thing is, Clark did get his revenge on the trolls. And in the best possible way \u2013 by becoming a huge success. Even the way he became a success was surprising: it wasn\u2019t by being outlandish, but by being kind and empathic. I\u2019ve heard lots of nice things about you, I say. He smiles. \u201cOooh, fucking hell, that\u2019s nice to hear.\u2019 It\u2019s quite unusual to hear this about someone in your world, I say. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much nasty shit I\u2019ve done. I think I\u2019ve always been nice to people and that showed when I came back from being ill. I didn\u2019t lose any of my jobs. I could have lost my Radio 2 show. I\u2019d had fucking six months off.\u201d Loyalty pays both ways, he says. Clark points out that his former Big Brother runner is now the director of his management company.\n\nView image in fullscreen With his then husband, Dan Clark-Neal, on This Morning. Photograph: S Meddle/ITV/Shutterstock\n\nWhen it came, his breakdown was extreme. He attempted suicide and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. The catalyst was splitting from his husband, Dan Neal, in 2021. Years after being unfaithful to Neal, he fessed up. Neal couldn\u2019t forgive him, and that was it. For a long time, Clark says, he questioned why he felt the need to tell Neal about it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why I pressed the nuclear button on my seemingly perfect life. And it\u2019s only now I\u2019m better that I realise it was the ejector seat I needed. Now I just wish I\u2019d pressed that escape button earlier.\u201d\n\nBut for a long time he was just struggling to stay alive. \u201cI got so ill to the point where I knew I couldn\u2019t get any iller.\u201d He says he simply couldn\u2019t function. \u201cI couldn\u2019t speak. I had to learn to speak again, I had to learn to move again. It was like I\u2019d had a stroke. I couldn\u2019t understand anything. Nothing made sense to me. I couldn\u2019t have the TV on and I couldn\u2019t listen to music. All I could do was sit in silence. TV and music\u2019s my job! I was fucked.\u201d\n\nHaving survived his breakdown, he says it\u2019s the best thing that could have happened to him. \u201cIt\u2019s made me who I am now. My only regret is I had to put my friends and family through it, and they had to watch me turn to nothing. Horrendous.\u201d\n\nHow did he come through it? \u201cI don\u2019t know. There wasn\u2019t a lightbulb moment. It sounds silly but I think the turning point was the fact that I didn\u2019t die. I wish I could give a better answer because if there was a turning point, I\u2019d bottle it and dish it out free of charge.\u201d\n\nWhat has become clearer than ever is how much he struggled with the reality of fame. \u201cI thought the celebrity was what I wanted. I wanted to be known. I didn\u2019t want to queue. I didn\u2019t want to be ignored. I wanted every fucker to know who I was, and then if I earned money out of it and got a job, great.\u201d His sole dream was fame? \u201cYeah, and I got it and very soon realised, \u2018No, it\u2019s the job I wanted, not the fame.\u2019 But then it was too late. If people want to see that as ungrateful, so be it.\u201d\n\nHe mentions the Pet Shop Boys song Flamboyant. \u201cIf the boys knew me I would genuinely go to a court of law to say they wrote it about me. There\u2019s a line that sticks with me every day and it\u2019s, \u2018Just crossing the street, well, it\u2019s almost heroic.\u2019 That\u2019s how I feel a lot of the time. \u2018I can\u2019t go there, I can\u2019t go there, I can\u2019t go there.\u2019 because I just get the fear a lot of the time.\u2019\n\nThen there\u2019s dating. It\u2019s a nightmare, he says. Clark has been thrown off dating apps because they think he\u2019s catfishing. And most people who realise he is for real struggle to treat him normally. Has he met anybody who didn\u2019t know who he was? \u201cYeah, I went to Barcelona a couple of years ago. I was like, \u2018My name is Josh and I\u2019m a family lawyer.\u2019 Great night.\u201d He grins. \u201cUntil a hen party walked in, went \u2018Oh my God, Rylan!!\u2019 and asked for a photo. Then the game was up.\u201d\n\nHe has still got to work out how to make peace with fame. One way is to remind himself how much he\u2019s loving his work \u2013 as well as the reality show, he\u2019s just made a documentary about homophobia in football. Another is to accept the industry for what it is and stay true to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s cut-throat. Cut-throat. You think people care about people? Not really.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut you know what? I earn a living from it and as long as I can sleep well at night knowing I haven\u2019t fucked people over, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nHot Mess Summer is on Prime Video from 7 February.\n\nInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Standing on stage in a sports stadium on the outskirts of Antakya, a city once rich in history now all but levelled by the quakes, the Turkish president continued to offer bold promises for reconstruction at break-neck speed, just as he had a year ago.\n\n\u201cNo matter what difficulties we encounter or we experience due to reasons beyond our control, there is no stopping or resting for us until we make Antakya a more magnificent, safer and more vibrant city than before,\u201d he declared.\n\nHad the presidential sedan travelled deeper into the city, the challenges wrapped up in these promises would have been made clear. Where whole neighbourhoods once stood, there is now block after empty block.\n\nAt the city\u2019s covered market, a few determined residents have in recent weeks begun returning to restart their businesses, but behind a man selling piles of daffodils in front of an intricate stone archway, piles of rubble and stone were still visible.\n\nView image in fullscreen Residents shop in the partially damaged but still functioning covered market in downtown Antakya. Photograph: David Lombeida/The Observer\n\nAt the destroyed entrance to the market, banners displayed images of the area\u2019s future, where a new glass roof would top gilded wooden shopfronts. Locals were unconvinced by the promise of the projects, said G\u00fcl\u015fah Alkaya, as she and her husband set up hair bands and bows inside their shop. They had little information, she explained, and had interpreted the glossy new designs for the market area \u2013 less like a market for Antakya residents and more like a location for high-end boutiques \u2013 to mean what remained was due to be torn down and rebuilt, when their aim was simply to return to work.\n\n\u201cThese projects look good, but the issue is they are slow,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like we just got back on our feet, so just let us get on with it. If they tear this place down again, we\u2019ll go back to square one.\u201d\n\nEven among the shards of tower blocks and towering piles of rubble that lined towns across south-eastern Turkey, the scale of the destruction remains difficult to comprehend. The World Bank estimated last February that the earthquakes caused $34bn (\u00a327bn) in damage. A Turkish parliamentary inquiry later estimated $148.8bn, almost 10% of the country\u2019s GDP.\n\nTo many, there was a clear culprit for the enormous death toll: corruption in the construction industry that is a powerful segment of society where the largest construction firms with deepest ties to the state are referred to as \u201cthe big five\u201d. Evidence for this was claimed in those towns and places where rows of tower blocks stood upright despite heavy damage while others had fallen entirely.\n\nSome buildings like the Renaissance in Antakya, an apartment block formerly known for its grandeur, became instant symbols of such destruction when many of their residents were killed as they slept. The Renaissance\u2019s developer, Mehmet Ya\u015far Co\u015fkun, was later arrested at Istanbul airport and remains a defendant in a case in which an expert report prepared as part of the indictment cited poor quality concrete as among the causes of the collapse. Co\u015fkun has said the fact the building fell on its side rather than collapsed in on itself was evidence it had been built solidly.\n\nParsing the results of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s sweeping promises on reconstruction have become tricky. \u201cWe will rebuild these buildings within one year and will hand them back to citizens,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said on a visit to the destroyed town of Kahramanmara\u015f just days after the quakes. He later pledged that 319,000 new homes would be constructed \u201cwithin a year\u201d of the quakes, and another 331,000 the following year. He promised on his recent visit to Hatay that \u201cwe will complete the delivery of 75,000 houses throughout the earthquake zone within two months\u201d, adding that 200,000 houses \u201cwill be delivered in the earthquake zone by the end of the year\u201d.\n\nAlthough construction is evident across a broad swath of the south-east, data on the results is opaque. A spokesperson for the Turkish presidency said in late January that \u201cthe construction of a total of 307,000 houses has started. The delivery of a total of 46,000 houses \u2026 has started gradually.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen The rubble-strewn site of a hotel in Ad\u0131yaman that collapsed during the quake, killing dozens of people. Photograph: The Observer\n\nAmid the promised construction boom, trials of developers and other industry figures are beginning. In early January, the first hearing of a trial where 11 are accused of \u201cconscious negligence\u201d took place in the city of Ad\u0131yaman, for their role in the building of a hotel that collapsed during the quakes killing 72 people.\n\nBut such cases are so far limited and there are questions over a 2019 government amnesty for illegal construction, which drew fears from engineers at the time. Human Rights Watch has called for efforts to examine the relationship between figures in the construction industry and the local officials who provided their building permits.\n\n\u201cTrials of real-estate developers, building controllers, and technical personnel have opened in recent months. But not a single public official, elected mayor, or city council member has yet faced trial for their role in approving numerous construction projects that fell far short of safe building standards or for failing to take measures to protect people living in buildings known to have structural problems in a region with a high risk of seismic activity,\u201d the group said.\n\nBeyond the widespread physical destruction, the scale of nationwide human suffering is equally difficult to grasp, magnified for many by the pain of the destruction of entire communities. Reconstruction can produce glistening new towers, but the restoration of communities is a different challenge entirely."}

However, the party was blocked from taking power by unelected senators, who are considered part of the military royalist establishment. The party\u2019s liberal agenda and huge appeal among young and urban voters is seen to represent a threat to the status quo in Thailand.\n\nOn Monday, a district court in Bangkok gave a four-month prison sentence, suspended for two years to six leading figures of Move Forward\u2019s predecessor \u2013 the now defunct Future Forward Party (FFP). Two other activists were also sentenced.\n\nThe charges relate to a protest in 2019, led by the Future Forward Party, urging reform and calling on former prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to quit. The case concerns a protest held on 14 December for 40 minutes at a key Bangkok intersection, months before a court would dissolve the FFP, of which Pita was a member.\n\n\u201cA court ruled that the protest was organised without permission, blocked public space, and was within 150 metres from Pathumwan palace,\u201d lawyer Krisadang Nootjaras told AFP.\n\nThe eight people sentenced, including business executive Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit and member of parliament Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, all plan to appeal against the verdict, their lawyer said.\n\nPita, the former leader of Move Forward was only recently reinstated as an MP, but could be disqualified from parliament if his appeal fails and courts uphold the verdict. Thai law does not allow people convicted of serious crimes to hold parliamentary seats.\n\nThe party now faces potential dissolution and its executives a ban from politics after lawyers and opponents launched more legal challenges in the wake of the constitutional court ruling last week.\n\nCriticism of the lese-majesty law, and of the royal family, has long been considered taboo in Thailand, but in 2020 mass youth-led protests demanded changes to the role of the monarchy, including an end to lese-majesty. Their protests dwindled after the authorities launched a legal crackdown, charging the main protest leaders.\n\nSince then more than 260 people, including children, have been prosecuted under lese-majesty, also known as article 112 of the criminal code. Cases can be filed by anyone, and the law is interpreted broadly.\n\nLast year, a man was given a reduced sentence of two years for selling satirical calendars featuring cartoon rubber ducks that a court said defamed the king. Another activist was sentenced in 2022 to two years for wearing fancy dress, which was deemed to be mocking the queen. Both are on bail while appealing against their convictions.\n\nReuters and Agence France-Press contributed to this report"}

Having resources and information readily available is imperative. I know between my experience and other care partners that I have spoken to; our stories are unfortunately similar. We left that office with close to no resources or support and with a diagnosis that I could hardly pronounce.\u201d\n\nWillis\u2019 condition was first made public in March 2022, when his family announced he would be retiring from acting due to aphasia, a disorder that causes difficulty with language or speech. A year later, it was announced that he had been formally diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Symptoms of FTD include emotional problems, trouble communicating, struggles with walking and difficulty working, according to the National Institute on Aging.\n\nWhen his diagnosis was made public, actors and directors who worked with Willis revealed they had been quietly voicing their concerns about his cognitive state for years, as he struggled to remember dialogue, needed lines rewritten to be shorter, expressed confusion at his surroundings and required shortened work days. The Razzie awards, which recognise the worst films and performances and had created a prize just for Willis\u2019 many appearances in films in 2021, withdrew the category after his condition was revealed.\n\nIn September, Heming Willis revealed she had become Willis main caregiver and said it was \u201chard to know\u201d if the 68-year-old actor fully understood his diagnosis.\n\nOn Monday, Heming Willis told the Sunday Paper that she has \u201cso much more hope today than I did after Bruce was first diagnosed. I understand this disease more now, and I\u2019m now connected to an incredible community of support. I have hope in having found a new purpose \u2013 admittedly one I never would have gone looking for \u2013 using the spotlight to help and empower others.\u201d\n\nShe said she hoped her book would help \u201ccare partners, but especially new care partners, who have just received this life-changing news \u2026 they should know they are not alone and there is support, even hope. In a perfect world, I envision this book in that doctor\u2019s office, and he or she, puts it in their hands to bring home.\u201d\n\nHeming Willis and Willis married in 2009 and have two daughters together."}

Instead, ministers will set out \u201cinitial thinking for future binding requirements\u201d for advanced systems and discuss them with technical, legal and civil society experts.\n\nThe government is also giving \u00a310m to regulators to help them tackle AI risks, as well as requiring them to set out their approach to the technology by 30 April.\n\nHowever, the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent AI research body, said the government should not wait for an impasse with tech firms or errors on the scale of the Post Office scandal before it acted.\n\nMichael Birtwistle, an associate director of the institute, said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be waiting for companies to stop cooperating or for a Post Office-style scandal to equip government and regulators to react. There is a very real risk that further delay on legislation could leave the UK powerless to prevent AI risks \u2013 or even to react effectively after the fact.\u201d\n\nThe potential for misuse of technology and its impact on people\u2019s lives has been thrown into stark relief by the Horizon scandal, where hundreds of post office operators were wrongfully pursued through the courts due to a faulty IT system.\n\nThe government has so far used a voluntary approach to regulating the most advanced systems. In November it announced at a global AI safety summit that a group of major tech companies, including the ChatGPT developer OpenAI and Google, had agreed with the EU and 10 countries, including the US, UK and France, to cooperate on testing their most sophisticated AI models.\n\nIn its response to a consultation on the AI regulation white paper, the government is sticking to its framework of established regulators \u2013 such as the communications watchdog, Ofcom, and the data regulator, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office \u2013 regulating AI with reference to five core principles: safety, transparency, fairness, accountability and the ability of newcomers to challenge established players in AI.\n\n\u201cAI is moving fast, but we have shown that humans can move just as fast,\u201d said the technology secretary, Michelle Donelan. \u201cBy taking an agile, sector-specific approach, we have begun to grip the risks immediately, which in turn is paving the way for the UK to become one of the first countries in the world to reap the benefits of AI safely.\u201d\n\nThe government is also expected to confirm that talks between copyright holders and tech companies over treatment of copyrighted materials to build AI tools have failed to produce an agreement. The Intellectual Property Office, the government agency charged with overseeing the UK\u2019s copyright regime, had been attempting to draw up a code of practice but could not broker an agreement. The failure of the talks was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nThe use of copyright-protected content in building AI tools such as chatbots and image generators, which are \u201ctrained\u201d on vast amounts of data culled from the internet, has become one of the most legally contentious aspects of the boom in generative AI, the term for technology that instantly produces convincing text, image and audio from hand-typed prompts.\n\nMatthew Holman, a partner at the UK law firm Cripps, said: \u201cUltimately, AI developers need clarity from UK government about how they can safely conduct data collection and systems training without being constantly at risk of a copyright claim for countless rights holders.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, copyright proprietors require help protecting their valuable intellectual property, which is being routinely copied without permission.\u201d"}

During their seven-month long inquiry, witnesses repeatedly called for a cross-industry battery health testing standard to provide \u201cclear information and reassurance to consumers\u201d.\n\nThe study raised concerns over the secondhand market as most vehicles available for resale are sports utility vehicles (SUVs) or cars costing more than \u00a340,0000 sold on by businesses and early adopters of EVs, meaning they are \u201cout of reach of most consumers\u201d.\n\nThe peers said grants should be awarded to bring down costs to make the purchases cheaper and stimulating an \u201caffordable\u201d market, before the subsidies are then tapered away when electric- and fossil fuel-powered cars reach the same price.\n\nThere were 35.1m cars on UK roads in 2022, of which 650,000 were pure electric, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Monday, as the all-time number of electric cars sold in the UK passed 1m.\n\nEfforts to reach net zero appear to have been undermined by a series of moves by the governing Conservatives as the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, vows to end \u201canti-car measures\u201d. Last year, Sunak delayed the ban on new petrol and diesel car sales from 2030 to 2035, a major U-turn on previous climate commitments.\n\nAnnouncing the move, Sunak said that achieving net zero \u201cis going to be hard\u201d. The Lords said: \u201cBy emphasising the costs while failing to stress the benefits and robustly counter misinformation, the government is not building public confidence.\n\n\u201cThe concern the government expressed to us about the scale of misinformation has not been matched by commensurate urgency in tackling it. Faced with conflicting claims and alarmist headlines, consumers need a go-to source of comprehensive, clear and balanced information.\u201d\n\nConservatives have also opposed the expansion of London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone and low-traffic neighbourhoods.\n\nThe Lords report also recommended: planning regulations should be reviewed to \u201cturbo-charge\u201d the rollout of charging infrastructure; VAT rates should be cut for public charging to help those without access to off-street parking; and investment should made into UK battery recycling facilities.\n\nLady Parminter, the chair of the inquiry, said: \u201cThe evidence we received shows the government must do more to get people to adopt EVs. If it fails to heed our recommendations the UK won\u2019t reap the significant benefits of better air quality and will lag in the slow lane for tackling climate change.\u201d\n\nThe government has been approached for comment."}

Research last week found young men from generation Z \u2013 many of whom revere social media influencer Andrew Tate \u2013 are more likely than baby boomers to believe that feminism has done more harm than good.\n\nMeanwhile, the mother of murdered teenager, Brianna Ghey, called for social media apps to be banned on smartphones for under-16s after hearing evidence about the online activities of her daughter\u2019s killers.\n\nThe UCL/Kent study, called Safer Scrolling, argues that harmful content is presented as entertainment through the algorithmic processes of social media. Toxic, hateful or misogynistic material is \u201cpushed\u201d to young people, with boys who are suffering from anxiety and poor mental health at increased risk, it said.\n\n\u201cHarmful views and tropes are now becoming normalised among young people,\u201d said principal investigator Dr Kaitlyn Regehr (UCL Information Studies). \u201cOnline consumption is impacting young people\u2019s offline behaviours, as we see these ideologies moving off screens and into schoolyards.\u201d\n\nResearchers interviewed young people engaging with and producing radical online content to help create a number of archetypes of teenage boys who might be vulnerable to becoming radicalised. Accounts were set up on TikTok for each archetype, each with specific interests \u2013 they might be seeking content on masculinity or loneliness \u2013 and researchers then watched more than 1,000 videos that TikTok suggested on its \u201cFor You\u201d page over seven days.\n\nThe initial suggested content was in line with the stated interests of each archetype, but after five days researchers said the TikTok algorithm was presenting four times as many videos with misogynistic content including objectification, sexual harassment or discrediting women, which increased from 13% of recommended videos to 56%.\n\n\u201cAlgorithmic processes on TikTok and other social media sites target people\u2019s vulnerabilities \u2013 such as loneliness or feelings of loss of control \u2013 and gamify harmful content,\u201d said Regehr. \u201cAs young people microdose on topics like self-harm, or extremism, to them, it feels like entertainment.\u201d\n\nResearchers also interviewed young people and school leaders about the impact of social media and found that hateful ideologies and misogynistic tropes have moved off screens and into schools, and have become embedded in mainstream youth cultures.\n\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, which collaborated with the research, said: \u201cUCL\u2019s findings show that algorithms \u2013 which most of us know little about \u2013 have a snowball effect in which they serve up ever-more extreme content in the form of entertainment.\n\n\u201cThis is deeply worrying in general but particularly so in respect of the amplification of messages around toxic masculinity and its impact on young people who need to be able to grow up and develop their understanding of the world without being influenced by such appalling material.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m pleased we have passed the Online Safety Act over the last year and that means the regulator now has tough new powers to control what is exposed to children online.\n\n\u201cAnd if the big social media companies do not comply with that, the regulator is able to levy very significant fines on them and the priority now is making sure that act is up and running.\u201d\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said: \u201cMisogyny has long been prohibited on TikTok and we proactively detect 93% of content we remove for breaking our rules on hate.

Much of the rise was the result of inflation driving up the value of goods being sold, masking a drop in sales volumes and a collapse in online spending.\n\n\u201cWhile the January sales helped to boost spending in the first two weeks, this did not sustain throughout the month,\u201d said the BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson.\n\n\u201cLarger purchases, such as furniture, household appliances, and electricals, remained weak as the higher cost of living continued into its third year.\u201d\n\nThe latest snapshot follows a disappointing Christmas for retailers after official figures showed a 3.2% monthly decline in December, marking the sharpest plunge since shops were forced to close during the Covid pandemic in 2021.\n\nConfirming a lacklustre start to 2024 as households continue to face sustained pressure on living costs, separate figures from Barclays showed consumer card spending grew 3.1% year on year in January \u2013 below the current headline rate of inflation of 4%.\n\nThe bank, which processes almost half of UK credit and debit card transactions, said there were some signs of strength amid an increase in consumer confidence.\n\nThe latest figures showed resilient demand for digital content and takeaway meals as consumers saved money by staying in and watching new TV releases such as Fool Me Once on Netflix and Mean Girls on Amazon Prime. Growth in supermarket spending also increased to 5.2% in January, up from 2.8% in December.\n\nIn contrasting claims about the health of the retail sector, the BRC suggested warm periods in January had hit spending on winter clothing and footwear, while Barclays blamed the fact consumers stayed away from the shops on cold weather.\n\nSeparate figures from S&P Global and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply showed a solid increase in business activity in the UK\u2019s services sector in January.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While not a legal document, some treaty principles have been developed and included in legislation. The treaty covers issues including land and cultural rights and M\u0101ori relations with the Crown.

For buyers, a purchase could mean their first leg up on the housing ladder, as well as finding more space and a better location. For sellers, a sale could mean downsizing from a large house, upgrading to a home with more space due to a growing family or even having to sell due to the \"three D's\": death, divorce and debt.\n\nBuyers, in particular, would be most interested in finding a home they consider undervalued for a variety of reasons, such as an up-and-coming location not yet on the radar of real estate agents, a well-designed home in need of some TLC or even a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) suffering through job losses. If they do opt for a home considered overvalued, that could be due to a rare find in a great neighborhood or school district in which they plan to spend many years.\n\nSometimes, however, undervalued homes are located in a MSA with a healthy job market, plenty of interesting cultural opportunities and other amenities. For our analysis, we're focusing on those MSAs with home prices and rents below what they should be based on local incomes, which could mean further upsides for homebuyers and investors.\n\n\n\nWhat Does Undervalued Mean?\n\nA general rule from the Department of Housing and Urban Development states that households spending more than 30% of their gross monthly incomes on a place to live are \"cost burdened.\" This burden has become even more important given the inflation spike U.S consumers have experienced over the last 2.5 years and leaves even less room for spending on other necessities of life, such as food, clothing, transportation and health insurance.\n\nFor our rankings of overvalued and undervalued markets, instead of household income we look more closely at local per capita incomes since that's considered by some to be a better measure of an area's wealth. Overvalued and undervalued markets are those in which households are respectively paying far more or less on their housing costs compared with the national per capita income.\n\nAs these are national figures, these ratios can vary widely between markets, with some homeowners paying up to two-thirds or more of local per capita incomes for principal and interest alone, and renters paying well over half.\n\nAlternatively, some homeowners and renters are paying less than one-quarter of local per capita incomes on principal and interest or rent. As a result, with many homeowners and renters paying much less than the ratio of housing costs to U.S. per capita income, a number of MSAs are undervalued based on local earnings.\n\n\n\nHow Home Prices Changed During and After the Pandemic\n\nIn the pre-pandemic days of late 2019 and early 2020, on a national level the U.S. housing market was still fairly balanced. With a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rate of 3.6%, the typical homeowner was paying just 22% of monthly per capita income on mortgage payments. At the same time, the typical tenant was paying a much higher 33% of monthly per capita income in rent, thereby providing a great incentive for them to dive into homeownership.\n\nHowever, by the end of 2023, while the share of monthly per capita incomes paid by tenants to landlords edged up to 34%, for homeowners it soared to 39%. This rise was mostly due to mortgage rates briefly jumping to nearly 7.8% before gradually falling and recently ranging from 6.6% to 6.9%.\n\nNotably, new markets added to the Housing Market Index since last November include Albuquerque, New Mexico, and two MSAs in Hawaii, including Kahului-Wailuku-Lahaina and urban Honolulu.\n\nFor this analysis, monthly housing costs below the national median per capita income for owning (39.1%) or renting (34.4%) indicate an undervalued market. Our data for these rankings are primarily sourced from the U.S. News Housing Market Index, an interactive platform providing a data-driven overview of housing markets nationwide.\n\nThese rankings are based on data from November 2023, which is the most recent and comprehensive data from the index. If you're following various housing markets, check back with the online interface for updates at least once per month. See the methodology here.\n\n\n\nUndervalued Homes for Sale\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market to purchase a home, the following five MSAs are the most undervalued, with a payment-to-per capita income ratio below 26% and as low as 18%. This ratio is well below the national average of just over 39%:\n\n\n\nDetroit: 18.0%\n\nCleveland: 20.6%\n\nPhiladelphia: 20.8%\n\nSt. Louis: 21.0%\n\nOklahoma City: 25.5%\n\nEven if former Rust Belt cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis and Oklahoma City are again topping the list of the most undervalued markets in which to buy a home, in more recent years some of them have successfully revitalized their economies and attracted new businesses due to relatively low costs of doing business. For the Detroit MSA, the median payment-to-income ratio of 18% is less than half the 39% ratio for the overall U.S.\n\nThe Most Undervalued MSA to Buy a Home\n\nThe Detroit MSA has a variety of strengths, such as a low unemployment rate, few foreclosures and the country\u2019s lowest mortgage payment-to-per capita income ratio. However, weaknesses include a low ratio of building permits to household growth and a sharp jump in the rental vacancy rate, which more than doubled from 5.2% to 11.4% in the 12 months prior to September 2023.\n\nAccording to an economic forecast through 2028 by the University of Michigan, Detroit's economy will continue to see steady growth in the years ahead with more jobs and higher wages for area residents. Although job growth won't rival fast-growing regions in states such as Texas and Florida, steady growth year after year is still a testament to the city's economic strategy to diversify and move away from mostly being known as the Motor City.\n\nDetroit may not be the most undervalued area for long, given the MSA had the highest year-over-year price gain through November, according to the widely followed 20-city S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index in a Jan. 30 report.\n\n\"Once again, Detroit reported the highest year-over-year gain among the 20 cities with an 8.2% increase in November, followed again by San Diego with an 8% increase,\" the report said.\n\nThe following is a deeper look at the various data points regularly tracked by the Housing Market Interface for this MSA:\n\nU.S. News\n\nThe overall Housing Market Index of 61.1 for the Detroit MSA fell by 2.3 year-over-year through October and is comprised of three subindexes on a 1-100 point scale, with 100 being the healthiest.\n\n\n\nDemand HMI \u2013 53.9\n\nSupply HMI \u2013 36.9\n\nFinancial \u2013 92.5\n\nLearn more about these subindexes and the data points they track.\n\nThe median price in the Detroit MSA fell 1.2% over the past year to $172,000, which is the lowest among the MSAs currently tracked by the Housing Market Index. Despite falling prices, housing supply has fallen by 0.5 months over the last year to 2.7 months. This level of supply is at least one-half of what is generally considered a balanced housing market.\n\nFor now, the rates of mortgage delinquencies in the Detroit area nearly match those at the national level, although these rates could rise if homeowners begin to struggle with higher bills for property taxes and property insurance. However, foreclosures remain at low levels which are also half the national average.\n\nU.S. News\n\nU.S. News\n\nOnce totaling over 1,000 and even sometimes 1,500 units per month 20 years ago, single-family detached building permits have ranged from 400 to 600 per month. Looking ahead through the first two months of 2024, they're forecast to range from 250 to 350 per month.\n\nPermits for multifamily homes, which typically ranged 300 to 400 units per month 20 years ago, plummeted to well under 100 per month in the wake of the financial crisis. In more recent years, multifamily permits have risen to as high as 400 per month, but totals can be volatile from month to month. Peering ahead further into 2024, multifamily permits activity is forecast to hover close to 150 per month.\n\nU.S. News\n\nU.S. News\n\nUndervalued Homes for Rent\n\nIf you\u2019re among the growing number of potential buyers waiting to decide on the right time to jump into the housing market, you may live in an MSA with a rent-to-income ratio far below the national median of 34.4%. In terms of undervalued rental housing markets, this list is led again by several markets in the Midwest in which this ratio ranges from about 24% to 26% of local per capita incomes:\n\n\n\nOmaha, Nebraska: 21.0%\n\nSt. Louis: 21.3%\n\nIndianapolis: 23.9%\n\nCleveland: 24.0%\n\nOklahoma City: 24.4%\n\nWhile Detroit is ranked as the 10th most undervalued market for buying a home, the lowest ratios for renting one are found in the greater Omaha (21.0%) and St. Louis (21.3%) areas. Other MSAs with rent-to-per capita income ratios below the national average of 34.4% include the other Midwest regions of Indianapolis, Cleveland and Oklahoma City. Interestingly, San Jose, California, also ranks as a relatively low-cost market for renters due to a high per capita income and a rent-to-per capita income ratio of 25.2%.\n\n\n\nThe Most Undervalued MSAs to Rent a Home\n\nThe Omaha MSA is ranked as one of the most undervalued regions to rent a home because its rental rates remain a bargain even after increases over nearly 6% from the past year.\n\nThe following is a deeper look at the various data points regularly tracked by the Housing Market Interface for this MSA:\n\nU.S. News\n\nThe overall Housing Market Index of 64.1 for the Omaha MSA edged up 2.22 year-over-year through October, with the subindexes ranging from 41.1 to 95.6 on a scale of 1-100:\n\n\n\nDemand HMI \u2013 55.5\n\nSupply HMI \u2013 41.1\n\nFinancial HMI \u2013 95.6\n\nBesides its low payment- and rent-to-income ratios, Omaha\u2019s strengths also include a low rental vacancy rate of just 3.1%, making it potentially attractive to investors. However, some of its weaknesses include housing permits not keeping up with household growth and low housing supply for sale of just 2.0 months.\n\nBy November 2023, even though the median observed rent price in the Omaha MSA rose 5.9% year-over-year to $1,293, it was still the lowest rent of the MSAs currently tracked by the Housing Market Index and compares with a median monthly mortgage payment of $1,961.\n\nOwning Vs. Renting\n\nFor those potential homebuyers looking for the best time to purchase a home, another metric to study is the difference between the cost of owning versus renting in a particular MSA. Whereas the difference between these ratios at the national level is about 4.7% (and up from just 0.9% a year ago) for the most undervalued market the cost to own can be up to 8% less than renting.\n\nThe following five MSAs are markets in which the cost to own is about 2% to 8% less than renting:\n\n\n\nDetroit: -8.1%\n\nPhiladelphia: -7.8%\n\nCleveland: -3.5%\n\nChicago: -2.4%\n\nColumbia, South Carolina: -1.7%\n\nMethodology\n\nThe U.S. News Housing Market Index is the most comprehensive collection of data points for the country\u2019s largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas also easily available for free on the Internet. This data is sourced from a variety of government and private sources and is referenced by clicking the i button next to an interface heading.\n\nThe overall index includes four subindexes:\n\nThe Demand HMI includes government data on employment, unemployment, household growth, consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, median home sales prices from Redfin and observed, smoothed housing rental prices from Zillow.\n\nThe Supply HMI includes government data on housing supply, rental vacancy rates, construction costs, construction jobs, builder sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders and architectural billings from the American Institute of Architects.\n\nThe Financial HMI includes government data on interest rates and access to credit, delinquencies and foreclosures from Black Knight, and ratios of monthly mortgage and rental payments to per capita incomes calculated by the index. Monthly mortgage payments assume conventional financing with 20% down at the average monthly 30-year fixed rate reported by Freddie Mac."}

(ZIM)\n\nZim Integrated Shipping Services is an Israeli shipping and logistics services company. Zim has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of rising tensions in the Middle East since Hamas attacked Israel in October. Slumping shipping rates and concerns over Zim's large debt load weighed on the stock in early 2023. However, outbreaks of violence in Red Sea shipping lanes in recent months have sent shipping rates sharply higher. On Jan. 29, Jefferies upgraded Zim from \"hold\" to \"buy,\" arguing improved shipping rates will shift the company's cash flow from negative to positive. Zim shares are up 51.9% in 2024.\n\n9. Rumble Inc. (RUM)\n\nRumble is a video streaming platform that emphasizes a commitment to free speech and has a large conservative user base. Back in 2021, Rumble partnered with former President Trump's Truth Social to provide video hosting services for the social media platform. Trump's victory in the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary triggered a rally in Rumble shares in January. A new partnership between Rumble and sports media company Barstool Sports, announced on Jan. 22, added fuel to the fire. Rumble shares are up 52.6% so far in 2024.\n\n8. Dyne Therapeutics Inc. (DYN)\n\nDyne Therapeutics is an early clinical-stage drug developer targeting muscle diseases, including myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. The company's leading experimental therapies are DYNE-101 and DYNE-251, targeting DM1. In early January, Dyne's share price spiked when it reported promising trial data for DYNE-251 in treating DMD. Dyne's therapy reportedly involves a lower dose and higher efficacy than competitor Exondys 51, produced by Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (SRPT). The stock's momentum continued later in the month amid reports that larger pharmaceutical companies are interested in a takeover of Dyne. The stock was up 60.9% in January.\n\n7. Edgewise Therapeutics Inc. (EWTX)\n\nEdgewise Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on treatments for rare muscle disorders. The company's lead therapy is EDG-5506, an oral, small molecule drug used to treat both Becker and Duchenne muscular dystrophies. On Jan. 19, Edgewise announced it priced a $240 million stock offering at $11 per share, raising money the company needs to fund a potential U.S. commercial launch of EDG-5506, complete its remaining late-stage trials testing EDG-5506 in treating DMD and continue to develop its other assets. Edgewise shares gained 62.9% in January, propelled by investor optimism surrounding EDG-5506.\n\n6. NewAmsterdam Pharma Co. NV (NAMS)\n\nNewAmsterdam Pharma is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapies to treat metabolic diseases. The company's lead experimental therapy is obicetrapib, a selective cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor. The global heart disease and cholesterol markets are massive, and investors are betting big on NewAmsterdam. The stock got a boost in January when Piper Sandler initiated coverage of NewAmsterdam with an \"overweight\" rating and $37 price target. At the time, the stock was trading for less than $18 per share. Even after gaining 83.3% in January, NewAmsterdam's share price is still well below Piper Sandler's target, suggesting the rally could continue.\n\n\n\nREAD 5 of the Best Stocks to Buy Now\n\n5. Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI)\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a tech company that produces a wide range of computer hardware products, including servers, networking equipment, motherboards and chassis. As the broad tech sector recovered in 2023, investor enthusiasm for stocks exposed to cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and autonomous vehicles has surged. Super Micro Computer shares jumped last year, and that momentum has carried over into 2024. Given the company's exposure to several high-growth technology fields, it's understandable why investors are buying the stock. Super Micro Computer shares are up more than 545% since the beginning of 2023 and up 86.3% already in 2024.\n\n4. Kaman Corp. (KAMN)\n\nKaman designs and manufactures aircraft and aircraft parts, including proprietary aircraft bearings, spring energized seals, and complex metallic and composite structures. On Jan. 19, Arcline Investment Management announced a $1.8 billion buyout of Kaman priced at $46 per share, a roughly 105% premium to its previous day's closing price. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of the year. The stock more than doubled the day the buyout deal was announced and is now trading within $1 of the $46 buyout price. Kaman's 88.1% January gain makes it one of the top-performing stocks of 2024.\n\n3. Ambrx Biopharma Inc. (AMAM)\n\nAmbrx Biopharma is a drugmaker targeting multiple forms of cancer using antibody-drug conjugates, which are specialized treatments that directly target and kill cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. On Jan. 8, pharma giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) announced a $2 billion buyout of Ambrx priced at $28 per share, more than double the stock's closing price of $13.63 on the previous day. Johnson & Johnson said it expects to close the deal in the first half of 2024. The takeover news understandably sent Ambrx shares ripping higher by 95.2% in January to within cents of the $28 buyout price.\n\n2. Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC)\n\nDigital World Acquisition is a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, that plans to take Donald Trump's media company, Trump Media & Technology Group, public. Investors seemingly saw Trump's victories in the Republican Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary as good news for Trump's business and the SPAC that intends to acquire it. Trump will likely be the Republican nominee for president in the 2024 election, which means plenty of social media engagement. Digital World shares are already up 116.9% this year on Trump's political momentum.\n\n1. Vera Therapeutics Inc. (VERA)"}

But I will see the fans sooner than later,\" he said via Instagram. \"I can\u2019t wait.\"\n\nAnd Keith kept his word.\n\nIn November 2022, Keith was awarded the 2022 BMI Icon Award at the BMI Country Awards, an event celebrating the songwriters and music publishers behind the 50 most-performed country songs of the year.\n\nIn June, he hosted a live auction as part of the 19th annual Toby Keith & Friends Golf Classic weekend.

The shows would be the final performances before his death.\n\nHere is what we know about about his battle with stomach cancer.\n\nToby Keith dies at 62:Bobby Bones, Stephen Baldwin, more pay tribute\n\nWhat is stomach cancer?\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, stomach cancer begins when cells in the stomach start to grow out of control. Stomach cancer is different from other cancers that can occur in the abdominal region, like colon, liver, or pancreas cancer. These cancers can have different symptoms, outlooks and different treatments.\n\nStomach cancers tend to develop slowly over time. Before a true cancer develops, pre-cancerous changes can occur in the inner lining of the stomach. Because these changes rarely cause symptoms, they often go undetected.\n\nWhat causes stomach cancer?\n\nThere are many risk factors that increases the chances of getting cancer, such as age, sex, diet, and alcohol and tobacco use, among others. While some factors can be controlled, others can not. The American Cancer Society says it's not often clear exactly how different factors might affect how cells in the stomach become cancer cells.\n\nThe subject is still being researched.\n\nIs there a cure for stomach cancer?\n\nThe main stomach cancer treatments involve surgery, chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, immunotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\nThe American Cancer Society says that often the best approach uses 2 or more types of treatment. The treatment received will depend on factors like the location and the stage of the cancer.\n\nWhat did Toby Keith say about his cancer treatment?\n\nKeith told The Oklahoman in June that he was continuing with chemo and his blood tests have looked good.\n\n\"Basically, everything is in a real positive trend. You never know with cancer, so you have to prepare. But my goal is, I feel better; I've got more wind. And I'm thinking about bringing the band in and setting up, playing two or three days somewhere just to see if I can get through two hours,\" Keith said.\n\n\"And if I do, (I'll) be out on the road this fall.\"\n\nToby Keith,country singer-songwriter, dies after stomach cancer battle\n\nContributing: Kristin M.

On their way to school, they hurry past Tom the Troll, a leaf-covered, fang-toothed monster who holds up handmade signs with insults directed at Lola.\n\nHer hair is too big. Her smile looks funny. Her voice is too loud.\n\nLola, terrified, begins to change until she no longer recognizes herself in the face of Tom\u2019s taunting.\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\nAnd while \u201cLola and the Troll\u201d is likely to be a child\u2019s birthday present this year, it seems just as likely to be given as a graduation gift, or a gift to a friend at the office. There\u2019s a reason Lola\u2019s story feels relevant to a lot more people than those in elementary school. After all, Schultz knows a thing or two about trolls.\n\nHow to fight a troll\n\nSchultz, a liberal and a feminist writer, has 500,000 followers across social media platforms.\n\nShe was one of the early columnists to take a stand on calling Donald Trump\u2019s untrue statements \u201clies.\u201d She writes about access to abortion; fair wages for women; medical care for transgender teens.\n\nShe also shares her favorite books, photos of her grandchildren and observations about finding beauty in the world. Either way, she isn\u2019t one to back down.\n\nIn return, too often, the trolls arrive. They\u2019re usually anonymous. But let\u2019s be realistic: They are men. And they are mean.\n\nThe comments are about her words but also her appearance.\n\nSchultz long ago stopped wavering on how to respond.\n\nIf a poster unintentionally shares incorrect information, she corrects it. But if a follower willfully spreads false information, she blocks them and deletes their comments. If a comment goes after a reader, she blocks them.\n\n\"I don't need everyone to agree with me,\" she says, \"but I need them to refrain from personally attacking fellow commenters or trying to misinform the public on my very public page.\"\n\nOne day in summer 2021, after blocking someone, she commented: \u201cTom the Troll has been blocked!\u201d\n\nAnother reader saw Schultz\u2019s response and commented that \u201cTom the Troll\u201d would make a great children\u2019s book.\n\nSchultz went to what was then known as Twitter and jokingly said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking of writing a children\u2019s book titled, Tom The Troll Has Been Blocked.\u201d\n\nIt was just a good Tweet. Yet within 24 hours, an editor with a division of Random House contacted her agent.\n\nInitially, Schultz was hesitant about the idea of writing a children\u2019s book.\n\nThis is a woman who wrote the New York Times bestselling novel \"The Daughters of Erietown,\" has written two memoirs, won a Pulitzer prize for criticism, wrote a weekly column for USA TODAY and now writes a wildly popular Substack column.\n\nBut a children\u2019s book was different.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had such reverence for children\u2019s books, and children,\u201d she says. \u201cI was worried about writing this.\u201d\n\nSchultz talked with the woman who contacted her agent and who would later become her editor for \u201cLola and the Troll.\u201d They walked through what goes into a children\u2019s book and how it wouldn\u2019t contain 1,000 words, shorter than her weekly newspaper columns. Yet each one counts.\n\nSchultz thought, maybe.\n\nInspired by Walter and Ela\n\nHer love of children is evident throughout the Cleveland home she shares with her husband, Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio. The walls are filled with colorful art by their eight grandchildren. A basket of dozens of fabric mice dressed in clothes sits next to a small cardboard house. And photos, so many photos.\n\nIt is a house that feels filled with love and life, even when Schultz is the only one at home.\n\nPicture books are stacked on the coffee table, where Schultz places her water glass as she explains how, as a single mother, she loved to buy children\u2019s books when her two were young. At the bookstore, they knew her by name. Now the bookstore has become a favorite place with her grandchildren.\n\nGood children\u2019s books were so very good. And bad ones? She didn\u2019t want to write one of those.\n\nWalter jumps up, a tiny sliver of fluff in a red sweater, his ear cocked. It is as if on cue. Actually, Walter makes lots of appearances on the sofa on this day. So maybe this isn\u2019t on cue.\n\nWalter is ever-present in the book as Tank, the little dog who follows Lola everywhere. Lola is inspired by Schultz\u2019s granddaughter Ela.\n\nSchultz remembers when her youngest was little. It wasn\u2019t easy to find books centered on brave girls.\n\nIf she was going to write this book, there was no question the main character would be a girl.\n\nShe thought about a time almost 20 years ago when she was giving a speech and a woman asked her how she dealt with the haters who go after her personally, often first targeting physical appearance. Sometimes they even went after her ability as a mother.\n\nAt first, Schultz said, she told the woman they didn\u2019t faze her. The woman said she wished she could be as brave as Schultz was.\n\nAnd Schultz realized her answer hadn\u2019t been the whole truth.\n\nShe used to question herself when readers were mean. It hurt. Sometimes it even scared her.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said that night, that the comments could be hurtful. \u201cI just don\u2019t let them stop me.\u201d\n\nShe thought about this as she began writing \u201cLola.\u201d If she was going to ask others to be brave, she needed to be too.\n\nAs she started writing, she felt less nervous and more excited in a new way about work.\n\n\u201cI felt like it was something new and I loved it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was something to look forward to.\u201d\n\nTo inspire, not to preach\n\nThe book had to be more than a story. It needed to mean something, but not be preachy or tell people how to parent. \u201cI would never do that,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to help start conversations.\u201d\n\nShe tried out drafts on some of her grandchildren, including a then 6-year-old Caroline and 4\u00bd-year-old Ela.\n\nShe thought about how a troll would appear to children and settled on one that made handwritten signs mocking Lola. Illustrator Sandy Rodriguez brought Tom to life. Schultz picked Rodriguez after seeing her work and falling in love with it. Schultz sent her photos of Ela and Walter for inspiration. Rodriguez is the one who decided Tom would have fangs and birthday hats as horns.\n\nWhen Schultz got to the part of the book where Lola begins to question herself \u2013 when she wants to change herself because of what Tom the Troll has said \u2013 her grandchildren stopped her.\n\n\u201cWhy would Lola think she has to be someone else?\u201d they asked.\n\n\u201cAnd that is exactly what I wanted. I wanted them to notice this before Lola does,\u201d Schultz says.\n\nSchultz felt like it was working.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be able to show girls this,\u201d she says. \u201cThat they don\u2019t need to change who they are. So much happens to women. People comment on their appearance and make us feel we don\u2019t measure up to their standards.\u201d\n\nThe troll in this book is meant to be a little funny, with a homemade costume and leaves draped over him.\n\nBut Schultz is aware of the trolls that have crept or leapt into her life, and those of other public figures. Some have threatened her or her husband, and that has resulted in higher security.\n\nShe still shares stories and posts photos. She isn\u2019t going to let them take away her belief in herself.\n\n\u201cI post these because I want every woman who sees them, including my granddaughters who might stumble upon them many years from now, to know what took me too long to learn,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEvery time someone stoops to attacking our looks, our age, or our gender, we win. They are unhappy people leading with their injuries, and they want us to feel demoralized and ashamed.\u201c\n\nAnd so \u201cLola and the Troll\u201d is a book about a child. But it really is a book about a teenage girl questioning the comments on her Instagram photo. And about a woman who keeps her opinions to herself because people mock her appearance in return. And about a national columnist and bestselling author who might feel vulnerable \u2013 but doesn\u2019t give up.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t let them tell you who you are. I want for us to be brave and not let the trolls in,\u201d she says.\n\nThe heroes in real life\n\nLike all those real-life women, Lola needs somebody to look up to. So while Lola is the hero of the story, her hero is a woman named Ms. Sneesby.\n\nMs. Sneesby, one day, wants to know why Lola's beautiful hair is hidden in a bun, why her lovely voice is now just a whisper. She asks, \u201cWhere is my friend?\u201d She helps Lola see that she doesn\u2019t need to hide who she is.\n\nIn a book by Schultz \u2013 who loved to buy her children books and makes the bookstore her favorite destination with her grandchildren \u2013 is it any wonder that Ms. Sneesby is a bookseller?\n\nBookstores championed Schultz\u2019s first novel, which debuted in June 2020 at the start of the pandemic. She couldn\u2019t do in-person events, but booksellers recommended her book and it soon was on the New York Times bestseller list.\n\n\u201cI love what bookstores stand for in the community,\u201d she says.\n\nNow her fourth book is headed to their shelves. Published by Razorbill, it\u2019s set to be released Tuesday.\n\nHer now 8-year-old grandson Milo took an early copy of the book, with simple black and white illustrations, back to his house during a visit just over a year ago.\n\nHer daughter called recently with a revelation. She said it would be best shared with a photo. In it, Milo proudly holds a book, his classmates all around it smiling. That book was \u201cLola and the Troll\u201d and the teacher said it was the children\u2019s favorite. The advance copy was a hit.\n\nSchultz calls it her first picture book. She chooses her words carefully and intentionally.\n\nHer first novel, she mentions, came out when she was 62.\n\nSchultz is 66 now.\n\nShe has another novel in the works, and it\u2019s not time to share the details, but for fans of \u201cErietown,\u201d it\u2019s not the sequel.

They're beautiful \u2013 or they're repulsive? They're giving you hope \u2013 or they're making you feel lonelier than ever?\n\nWhen happy couples hold hands, share a smooch, make heart hands and more, people on the sidelines form opinions about their interactions. Some are positive and supportive. But often people pass judgement and have negative thoughts while watching a happy couple be, well, happy. Why?\n\n\"She\u2019s a woman supporting her boyfriend, just as he\u2019s supported her,\" one mom of a Swiftie wrote in a public Facebook post. \"Maybe it\u2019s love that will last, maybe it won\u2019t, but can\u2019t we be hopeful and happy for someone else\u2019s happiness?\"\n\nExperts say your take on happy pairs, like Swift and Kelce, may reveal way more about you than the couple in question.\n\n\"Our tendency to be happy for others or experience jealousy is strongly related to how we are experiencing our lives and relationships in the present,\" says Miranda Nadeau, a licensed psychologist.\n\nTaylor Swift, Travis Kelce and finding joy in 'Swelce'\n\nMaybe you're one of those people who can't stop gushing over Swelce or a couple more close to home.\n\n\"How people react to seeing other's joy and happiness is very telling,\" says Maryanne Fisher, a psychology professor at St. Mary's University in Canada. \"Some people are genuinely happy at seeing other's (including celebrities) happiness.\" You might be feeling \"freudenfreude,\" or \"a vicarious experience of another's joy \u2013 think opposite to schadenfreude, where one gets pleasure from another person's misfortunes,\" Fisher adds.\n\nIf you are a Swiftie, you may feel this more pronounced. \"It is likely that the effect is increased when we feel a connection with the person involved, which fans may certainly experience with celebrities,\" Fisher says. \"This sharing of joy has all sorts of positive effects; it makes us believe things are positive and good, and relatedly decreases stress and the associated cortisol hormone.\"\n\nAre you 'unconsciously projecting?'\n\nOn the flip-side: Finding yourself feeling bitter?\n\n\"It could stem from displeasure in one's own life \u2013 for example, secretly thinking that one's own relationship is unsatisfying may lead to them feeling deep-seated envy toward those who express affection, and this envy may be presented as low-grade anger, or displeasure,\" Fisher says. You may also experience fear of never finding love of your own, or fear of betrayal from a now-distracted friend.\n\nDig deeper:The Taylor Swift jokes have turned crude. Have we learned nothing?\n\nIt's easy to see yourself in other people \u2013 especially when they're as famous as Swift and Kelce, who likely have no connection in your life beyond the parasocial. Maybe you're a Swiftie, but in one of your sad girl eras.\n\n\"A lot of people may be unconsciously projecting,\" says Cecille Ahrens, a licensed clinical social worker. \"We often project our fears and desires out into the world. We also tend to displace our feelings, our unmeet needs, our grievances onto the wrong people. (Swift and Kelce) are great targets for these defense mechanisms.\"\n\nThese reactions, too, could mean you're living with a scarcity or abundance mindset. \"With a scarcity mindset, we may believe on some level that happiness or love are finite and limited, and that someone else being happy means we're that much more unlikely to experience similar joy ourselves,\" Nadeau says. Social or financial circumstances might affect how you look at the world and prompt this attitude.\n\nAs for an abundance mindset: \"We're more likely to be happy for others in their contentment,\" Nadeau adds. \"There's no threat to us or our attainment of love and satisfaction. And it's a lot easier to be happy for others when we're in loving, generous, exciting relationships ourselves.\"\n\nCuffing season has arrived.Don't jump into a relationship just because it's here.\n\nOr maybe it's not that serious\n\nIt's possible to oscillate between feelings \u2013 to begin accepting others' love stories even when you are jealous \u2013 though it's easier said than done to adjust your mindset. \"Still, we can deepen our sense of what we do have in our lives and grow our abundance mindset by practicing gratitude,\" Nadeau says. \"Feeling deep appreciation for what we already have helps us to want the best for others too.\"\n\nYour feelings may not signal any kind of deeper trauma to work through, either.\n\n\"Someone who does not really care about someone could just think it's sweet to see happy people and leave it at that,\" Fisher says. \"Also, we need to remember that it can also mean that they really did not like the person to start with, and the change of events has just simply given them a way to express this dislike. It's hard to believe, but not everyone is a Swiftie.\"\n\nSeriously:The Taylor Swift jokes have turned crude. Have we learned nothing?"}

Adams is out for the season after sustaining a knee injury last season that required surgery. Adams last played Jan. 22, 2023, but he is expected to make a full recovery and be ready for the 2024-25 season. Adams averaged 8.6 points, 11.5 rebounds and 1.1 blocks and shot 59.7% in 42 games last season. Oladipo hasn't played this season after tearing the patellar tendon in his left knee during the playoffs with Miami in April.\n\nHornets trade Terry Rozier to Heat for Kyle Lowry\n\nJan. 23: The Charlotte Hornets traded guard Terry Rozier to the Miami Heat for Kyle Lowry and a protected 2027 first-round drat pick. This helps the Heat on two fronts. They get a scoring guard in Rozier, who averages 23.2 points, 6.6 assists, 3.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals and shoots 45.9% from the field and 35.8% on free throws, and shedding Lowry's contract will save the Heat $15.4 million luxury taxes, according to ESPN front office insider Bobby Marks. The deal also signals Charlotte's plans to amass draft picks. The pick is lottery protected in 2027 and becomes unprotected in 2028.\n\nPacers land Pascal Siakam in deal with Raptors\n\nJan. 17: Toronto traded Pascal Siakam to Indiana for three first-round draft picks, Bruce Brown, Jordan Nwora and Kira Lewis Jr., who the Pacers acquired from New Orleans in exchange for cash considerations to faciliate the deal. It's actually a good move for both teams.\n\nPistons get veterans Danilo Gallinari, Mike Muscala from Wizards\n\nJan. 14: The Detroit Pistons acquired Danilo Gallinari and Mike Muscala from the Washington Wizards for Marvin Bagley, Isaiah Livers and two second-round draft picks. The Pistons get two veterans on expiring deals to help with a young squad this season, and the Wizards take on two team friendly contracts and draft capital.\n\nRaptors send OG Anunoby to the Knicks\n\nDec. 30: The Toronto Raptors traded OG Anunoby, Precious Achiuwa and Malachi Flynn to the New York Knicks for RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley and a 2024 second-round draft pick. The Raptors get scoring (and a hometown star in the Toronto-born Barrett), and the Knicks acquire more defense in Anunoby, who the Knicks believe can expand his offensive game.\n\nClippers land James Harden from Sixers\n\nNov. 1: The Philadelphia 76ers sent James Harden, P.J. Tucker and Filip Petrusev to the Los Angeles Clippers for Nic Batum, Robert Covington, Kenyon Martin Jr., Marcus Morris Sr., two first-round picks (2026, 2028), a first-round pick swap and two-second round picks in a deal that also included the Oklahoma City Thunder. OKC received the rights to a pick swap and cash considerations from the Clippers who added Harden to a roster that features Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and Russell Westbrook.\n\nKings get Filip Petrusev from Clippers\n\nNov. 1: The Clippers traded Filip Petrusev and cash considerations to the Sacramento Kings for the draft rights to Luka Mitrovic, the 60th pick in 2015 draft who plays in Serbia."}

This is the fourth installment of the series.\n\nIn the 1970s, years before Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed character would lose to Rocky Balboa, he was a member of the Oakland Raiders. Not in a movie. In real life.\n\nWeathers played defensive end at San Diego State and went undrafted by the NFL but was signed as a free agent by the Raiders. He played in seven games in the 1970 season and as Weathers recounted to Sports Illustrated, one day he was called into the office of legendary coach John Madden, and told to bring his playbook.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know what he meant by it, but I know how I took it,\" Weathers explained. \"He said to me, 'You\u2019re just too sensitive.' What the (expletive) do you mean I\u2019m too sensitive? Not that it\u2019s not true.\"\n\nWeathers would go on to play in the Canadian Football League for the BC Lions but that comment from Madden would impact Weathers in a huge way.\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t let it go, man,\" he said. \"It kind of put a chip on my shoulder on one hand and it was like a wound on the other because as a football player, certainly, as a professional football player, the last thing you want to hear is that you\u2019re too sensitive. On the other hand, without that sensitivity, how could I be an actor? How could I be an actor of any worth, really?\n\n\"That\u2019s what we trade on. We trade on performances that delve into the humanity of us all. So on one hand, it felt like an indictment, like I committed a crime. And on the other hand, I guess it reminded me of something that was actually necessary in me to succeed and what I envisioned doing with my life as a performer, as an artist. So, God bless John Madden for seeing something in me and naming it what it actually is: a certain amount of sensitivity.\"\n\nWeathers died in his sleep last week at age 76. His role in the \"Rocky\" movies is well chronicled, and his football life, while not as well known, was also impressive. But there's something else Weathers did that was just as important.\n\nThe movie \"Predator\" would make the top 20 or even top ten list of many science fiction fans. This is particularly true if you were a Black, hardcore sci-fi nerd like me, in my early 20s, watching the movie in all of its campy glory.\n\nEven in 1987, when the movie debuted, there were few Black film stars in science fiction and Weathers' character, Dillon, was an equal to Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s Dutch. The infamous handshake between the two characters has since become a goofy meme but at the time it was a symbol of their equality.\n\nHe'd go on to a role in the \"Star Wars\" spinoff \"The Mandalorian\" where he played the leader of a sort of bounty hunter union. He was really good in the series but it was his \"Predator\" role that put Weathers into science fiction high orbit. That's how good the movie was. That's how good Weathers was."}

Taylor Jr.\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr. tackles your human resources questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society and author of \"Reset: A Leader\u2019s Guide to Work in an Age of Upheaval.\u201d\n\nHave a question? Submit it here.\n\nQuestion: Though I have had positive feedback on my performance since starting my job, I was recently laid off for performance reasons. In fact, this is the first time I've been singled out for substandard work, and they didn't provide any specific detail on the standard or my work. Are employers required to give a reason for a layoff? Do I have any recourse if they provide a false reason? \u2013 Maya\n\nAnswer: I am genuinely sorry to hear about your recent layoff. It must be incredibly jarring to learn about perceived substandard work for the first time in the midst of being laid off. Unfortunately, I don't have the best news for you. While there are some states where your employer may be required to provide an explanation pursuant to state law, an employment contract, or a collective bargaining agreement, generally speaking, employers can terminate your employment for any nondiscriminatory reason and they don't have to give you the reason.\n\nLayoffs are often driven by broader business pretexts, such as cost-cutting or organizational restructuring, and may not necessarily reflect on the performance of individual employees. Employers should utilize nondiscriminatory criteria when conducting layoffs, considering factors like seniority, job skills, and performance. It is worth noting that employers must also avoid discrimination and ensure fair treatment in the selection process.\n\nYou may have legal recourse if you suspect the layoff decision was discriminatory or based on false reasons. Unlawful reasons for layoff can include factors like pregnancy, age discrimination (for those 40 or older), or issues related to religion or disability. You may also have legal options if the layoff occurred because you exercised your rights to certain employment protections, such as workers' compensation or paid sick leave.\n\nBefore considering legal action, I recommend contacting your former human resources department to gather more details about the layoff. Understanding the specific reasons behind the decision can provide clarity. Additionally, you may contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the government agency responsible for enforcing workplace discrimination laws, to discuss your situation.\n\nThere is a marked difference between illegal and poor business conduct. While you have recourse when impacted by an unlawful employer action, your options are limited when such employer behavior falls short of being illegal. Though a layoff may hurt in the short term, in the long run, you'll be better off in an employee-employer relationship based on mutual respect.\n\nI sincerely hope you have found new opportunities since your layoff. If you are still in the job market, I wish you the best of luck in your search for stable and meaningful work.\n\nRecordings on the jobIs it illegal to record a conversation at work? Ask HR\n\nA graphic design company just offered me a new job, and I'm leaning toward taking it, but they don't offer any health insurance benefits. Is that legal? \u2013 Dorian\n\nCongratulations on receiving a job offer. That's fantastic news. Regarding your concern about health insurance benefits, whether it's legal for an employer not to offer them depends on certain factors.\n\nIf the company has fewer than 50 full-time employees, they are not subject to the Affordable Care Act, which mandates employers to provide health care benefits or face penalties. For smaller businesses, offering health insurance may be challenging due to budget constraints. In 2023, the average health benefit cost per employee was $13,800, making it a significant expense. Providing such benefits might only be feasible for a smaller employer or startup with limited resources once they grow and become more established.\n\nOn the other hand, if the graphic design company has more than 50 full-time equivalent employees, they fall under the ACA regulations and may choose to offer health insurance or pay a penalty to the IRS. The penalty for 2024 is $2,970 per full-time employee (minus the first 30 full-time employees), which is substantially less than the average cost of health care.\n\nIf health insurance is a priority for you, there are options available. Many health insurance companies offer standalone plans for individuals and families. Additionally, you can explore purchasing health insurance through HealthCare.gov or your state exchange. I recommend comparing different options to find a plan that fits your budget.\n\nUltimately, if this job opportunity excites you and aligns with your career goals, don't allow the absence of health insurance benefits to be the sole deterrent. Alternative solutions are available to ensure you have the coverage you need while pursuing this exciting opportunity.\n\nBest of luck in your decision-making process, and I hope this new job brings you fulfillment and success!\n\nMoving for work?How do I ask an employer to pay for relocation costs?

While it may seem strange to think of a world without ecological awareness, there was once a time when Americans were even less unaware of their consumption's impacts on Earth.\n\nFollowing the publication of \"Silent Spring\" by Rachel Carson in 1962, public concern began to grow for the environment and the links between pollution and health.\n\nThough Earth Day is just one day, many take the initiative throughout the year to better our planet. To see how it started, here is the history of Earth Day and when it falls in 2024.\n\nWhen is Earth Day?\n\nEarth Day 2024 falls on Monday, April 22.\n\nWhy do we celebrate Earth Day?\n\nEarth Day is celebrated in the U.S. on April 22 every year. While it is not a federally recognized holiday, many celebrate the day through environmental education, awareness and action.\n\nEach Earth Day can \"drive a year of energy, enthusiasm, and commitment to create a new plan of action for our planet,\" according to earthday.org.\n\nEarth Day 2024 focuses on eliminating plastic usage \"for the sake of human and planetary health.\" There is a goal to decrease plastic production by 60% by 2040 through shopping sustainably voting, participating in cleanups and practicing climate literacy.\n\nWhen did Earth Day start?\n\nThe first Earth Day was celebrated in 1970 thanks to Sen. Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin.\n\nNelson had been concerned about the environment for years and sought to educate people and raise public consciousness in the U.S. toward his cause, earthday.org reports. Along with Rep. Pete McCloskey, a California congressman, and Denis Hayes, an activist, they organized campus teach-ins on April 22.\n\nHayes helped grow their staff to promote events nationwide. The name \"Earth Day\" was then adopted, and media began to cover the cause, according to earthday.org.\n\nThat first Earth Day, 20 million Americans participated in various efforts to bring awareness to environmental causes, such as fighting pollution, oil spills and pesticides.\n\nThe first Earth Day sparked further conversation in politics, leading to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of first-of-their-kind environmental laws, such as the National Environmental Education Act and the Clean Air Act.\n\nBy 1990, Earth Day went global as 200 million people in 141 countries celebrated by calling attention to various environmental issues. Today, Earth Day is one of the largest secular observances in the world with over 1 billion people participating each year.\n\nJust Curious for more?

Hint: She's like us", "domain": "usatoday.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMI7D-wowkqT0Ag", "text": "COLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2014 Maybe you have to witness the Caitlin Clark Experience in person to truly comprehend it.\n\nFrom floor level, you see it all closer: the behind-the-back dribbles, the flying rebounds and coast-to-coast layups before the other team can get settled on defense. You see the twisting, slashing moves to the basket and the 3-pointers that go down after you think a defender has her smothered.\n\nYou see the smile, too. It can come in the huddle with teammates, or sitting at the podium with one of them after a game, or looking back at you when you ask her a question.\n\n\"I came to Iowa with huge aspirations and now I\u2019m getting to play in front of 15,000-plus every single night and that\u2019s so cool,\" Clark said Saturday night after scoring 38 points to help beat Maryland and get within 66 points of the NCAA women\u2019s scoring record. \"Those are moments that you really can only dream of and now I\u2019m living it every single day of my life and that\u2019s really special.\"\n\nWhen No. 4 Iowa hosts Penn State on Thursday, the 6-foot senior point guard can put a significant dent in, or may even break Kelsey Plum\u2019s women's scoring record (3,527). You wonder if there was a moment when everyone \u2013 her parents, her coaches, her fans - realized Clark was capable of an achievement such as this. Few parents, even the most optimistic ones, start kids out with such lofty goals.\n\nDickson Jensen, Clark\u2019s former AAU coach for the All Iowa Attack in her home state, describes her rise to superstardom as a \u201cstepping process.\u201d Jensen, who met Clark when she was in sixth grade, says she could take older kids to the rim as a young player. She scored 60 points in a game as a high schooler. She averaged 26.6 as a freshman at Iowa and has come back even better each season.\n\nAs you speak to those close to her, you understand something deeper about Clark, too: Through it all, she has remained Caitlin, the daughter, the teammate and the engaging personality. She\u2019s driven to succeed, yes, but she\u2019s always had a healthy understanding of herself.\n\n\"My wife and I say this a lot: she\u2019s almost a natural at this stuff,\" her father, Brent Clark, tells USA TODAY Sports. \"She doesn\u2019t ask me for advice and I\u2019m not telling her how to handle it. On the podium, no one is telling her what to say, that\u2019s just her. If anything I just tell her, with all her accolades, to stay humble and stay hungry because there\u2019s always someone else out there working hard.\"\n\nIt takes more than just being a superior player to be a star. It takes effervescence, for sure, and some humanity \u2013 a feeling he or she can instill in us that they are like us in some ways.\n\nThree reasons why we all \u2013 whether fans, sports parents, young athletes or even someone who doesn\u2019t fit into those categories - can relate to Clark.\n\n1. Caitlin Clark once got cut, and she used the experience to get better\n\nIt happened when Clark was 16, when she had already played against kids a few years older than her in AAU ball. Clark and her father were in Colorado Springs at tryouts with Team USA\u2019s U17 World Cup squad in 2018.\n\n\"I got the phone call,\" Brent says. \"She was crying and just said, \u2018I got cut.\u2019 And it wasn\u2019t even the last cut, it was the second-to-last cut! And she had been on the team the previous year, the summer before was the qualifying team.\n\n\"So I drove over, picked her up \u2212 they basically put you on a plane and send you home right away \u2212 and she cried for about five minutes straight and I let her. Then I just told her, \u2018From here on out, you need to put that away and just use it as motivation,\u2019 and that\u2019s exactly what she did. That summer, playing with the All Iowa Attack, they won the national championship.\"\n\nJensen, her coach on that team, saw an opportunity. It was tough for Clark to get to the rim against girls 6-2 and taller that she faced in the Team USA camp. She realized she needed a pull-up jump shot. She started taking hundreds upon hundreds of shots per day, moving as far back as the logo on the court.\n\n\"That was about the time that she developed her step-back,\" Jensen says. \"She became a much, much better shooter and a deep shooter.\"\n\n2. Caitlin Clark's parents allow her to be herself\n\n\"There are a lot of parents that ruin young players,\" says Jensen, whose program has sent kids to Division I programs all over the country and to the WNBA. \"I\u2019m not gonna quote names but I know multiple examples of kids that could have been terrific young players and the parents just don\u2019t have it in perspective and it\u2019s disappointing. Social media is a large part of it. The NIL is becoming a huge part of it and, also, just the transfer portal, and the ability that, if Mom and Dad don\u2019t like it, they can just leave.\"\n\nClark hasn\u2019t gotten caught up in her success because her parents, Brent and Anne, haven\u2019t let her.\n\n\"You\u2019ll never hear from her parents that, \u2018Oh, boy, isn\u2019t Caitlin Clark the greatest thing in the world?\u2019 \" Jensen says. \"They\u2019re continuing to keep her grounded and they\u2019re grateful for everything that Caitlin has been able to receive. They don\u2019t think they deserve anything. Everything\u2019s earned and nothing\u2019s promised.\"\n\nHer former coach describes her as fun, playful and a little sarcastic, even when the joke\u2019s on her. Near the end of a game against Kansas State, one of Iowa\u2019s two losses this season, Clark front-rimmed a 3-point attempt when Iowa still had a small chance of coming back. She has since joked with Jensen about her bad shot. In the final seconds of the game against Maryland, when Iowa had things in hand, she took a long baseball pass from a teammate and blew a layup.\n\nShe had a big smile after she missed.\n\n\"She\u2019s still playing,\" Jensen says. \"She\u2019s playing a game, and a lot of these college athletes, it turns into a job and when it\u2019s your job, some days you enjoy it and some days you don\u2019t and, over time, you probably don\u2019t enjoy it as much as you should.\"\n\n3. Caitlin Clark inspires in more ways than just scoring points\n\nEveryone on Iowa\u2019s team is in a fast, continuous motion on offense until someone is inevitably open. They rely on each other, trust each other. It doesn\u2019t matter who gets the shot.\n\nDuring stoppages of play, they often smile, laugh, and soak in the moment.\n\nYou saw similar joy on the faces of kids who lined up about three hours early to watch Clark play against Maryland. There were girls and boys wearing her No. 22 jersey.\n\n\"She is a really good player and she\u2019s a really, really good athlete and she has such great sportsmanship,\" says Karmella Moore, who traveled to the game from Pittsburgh with her school-aged basketball teammates Callie Krabetsky and Sawyer Smith.\n\nMatt King and his high school-aged daughter, Riley, flew in from Georgia. Other fans came from North Carolina and Iowa. Clark said after the game she is aware of the fans, especially the kids, who root for her and of the larger responsibility she carries.\n\n\"I think that\u2019s one of the privileges of being in the position that I am is I get to be a role model and our whole entire team gets to be role models,\" she says. \"People look up to us \u2013 young girls, young boys, no matter who they are and I think the thing I would just say to them is the same thing I\u2019ve said all my career is just dream big.\"\n\nContributing: Lindsay Schnell\n\nSteve Borelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

The Super Bowl party, the USA\u2019s great secular gathering, might be the ultimate m\u00e9lange of awkward connections, from the super fan annoyed they don\u2019t have anyone with which to talk Cover 2 or 12 Personnel, to the cultural wiseacre who somehow knows the backstory of every celebrity in every commercial, to the book club coordinator wondering why color of jersey doesn\u2019t factor into the final score.\n\nAnd then Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes will drift back to pass, perhaps scramble out of trouble and sling the ball to No. 87 in red, and suddenly, everybody is in on the bit.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nSee, Swift didn\u2019t just collide her own brand into the cultural behemoth that is the NFL; she also dragged Kelce right into the country\u2019s withering monoculture. And when the camera zooms in on an exultant Kelce and cuts to a cheering Swift in a private box (assuming she returns from a Tokyo tour date in time), the audience will be strangely united in a way no other player on the field or influencer in a commercial can do in the four hours surrounding that moment.\n\nEverybody will know their names.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s become a cultural touchstone, a kind of lingua franca topic that everybody can discuss safely and energetically,\u201d says Brian Donovan, an associate chairperson of sociology at Kansas University who teaches The Sociology of Taylor Swift at the university in Kelce\u2019s backyard. \u201cI lived in Chicago in the 1990s during the height of the Bulls era and I remember talking to complete strangers about them. The Bulls provided that cultural glue to everyone living in Chicago.\n\n\u201cI feel like Taylor Swift is doing the same thing \u2013 everybody has some kind of purchase on her celebrity. Everybody can talk about Taylor and Travis. It's remarkable having not experienced this in decades.\u201d\n\nFor America\u2019s ultimate power couple, owning the Super Bowl stage will mark a high point \u2013 though perhaps not the apex \u2013 of their household recognition.\n\nA steady climb into \u2018the stratosphere\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly two decades since Swift\u2019s self-titled major-label debut was released in 2006, beginning an evolution from country singer to pop star to multi-generational global powerhouse. Kelce\u2019s rise to notoriety was far more deliberate: On Sept. 12, 2009, he caught the only pass of his freshman season at the University of Cincinnati, a 3-yard reception against Southeast Missouri State.\n\nOne night later, Swift\u2019s infamous imbroglio with Kanye West unfolded after the rapper stormed the stage at MTV\u2019s VMAs while Swift accepted an award.\n\nKelce simply went merrily about his business, missing his sophomore season due to a marijuana suspension that fortuitously made him a tight end for life, reveling in nap time and growing into an unstoppable pass-catching force.\n\nA decade later and Kelce \u2013 born in 1989, just like Swift \u2013 has scored 93 touchdowns for the Chiefs, 19 in the playoffs, more than any active player. The Chiefs are aiming for their third Super Bowl title in the past five years and Kelce\u2019s already been a Madison Avenue smash.\n\nHe\u2019s often playing Robin to Mahomes\u2019 Batman, such as in spots for State Farm Insurance and Subway. Yet even before Swift stepped onto his stage, Kelce had grown into a leading man, hosting Saturday Night Live last winter, appearing solo in ads for DirecTV and Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, while co-starring with brother Jason and mother Donna in a Campbell\u2019s Soup campaign.\n\nThe Kelce family has resonated from coast-to-coast, Travis often citing their modest Cleveland Heights upbringing and riffing relatably with Jason on their \"New Heights\" podcast.\n\nNowadays, the podcast is practically de rigueur for elite or notorious athletes, from Tom Brady to Draymond Green to Mookie Betts. But Kelce has something else in his corner, and we\u2019re only now experiencing the Swift effect on his celebrity.\n\nAccording to Edison Podcast Metrics, \"New Heights\" did not rank among the USA\u2019s top 100 podcasts in the second quarter of 2023. By the fourth quarter \u2013 by which time Kelce and Swift had been shipped \u2013 it ranked No. 6 and was No. 1 and 2 last week on Apple and Spotify, respectively.\n\nAnd Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl may elevate Kelce beyond any old Gronk and project him permanently into our living room.\n\n\u201cI do think this takes it to a completely different level,\u201d says Charles R. Taylor, professor of marketing at Villanova\u2019s School of Business. \u201cEven though there seem to be people out there who don\u2019t like seeing Taylor Swift at the football games, nonetheless she\u2019s an absolute mega star, the top music star of this generation.\n\n\u201cLinking to that level of attention and a different fan base than is traditionally associated with hard core NFL fans \u2013 that level of intensity with which a lot of young female viewers watching Chiefs games is something different.\n\n\u201cI think this puts him into the stratosphere.\u201d\n\nNo matter who loses their minds along the way.\n\n\u2018This is a love story\u2019\n\nNobody knows if the \u201cT&T\u201d union will endure six more months, six years or six decades. If it is measured in years rather than months, the romance will have survived an initial trial by fire that has ranged from doubts about the relationship\u2019s veracity to theories far less grounded in reality.\n\nSure, it seems a little convenient: A global star aligning with the NFL, her country\u2019s most unstoppable entertainment entity (haven\u2019t you seen the Nielsen ratings?), while canoodling with the sport\u2019s dudeliest dude, an everyman with a penchant to reach the end zone and the Super Bowl.\n\nIt is a significant coup for the NFL, which reported its strongest viewership among female fans \u2013 up 9% \u2013 since the league began tracking that metric in 2000. It has connected elusive Gen Z and millennial fans to the game, no small feat for a global behemoth that nonetheless is obsessed with \u201cfuture-proofing\u201d its industry.\n\nWhen the symbiosis is too perfect, people will wonder.\n\n\u201cIf you could draw the playbook of how to generate young female interest, this is what you would do,\u201d says Kim Whitler, associate professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business. \u201cIt just so happens to be a fortuitous situation for the NFL. For them to end up in the Super Bowl \u2013 what are the odds of that?\n\n\u201cThis is a tailor-made way to drive affinity among young women. I tend not to think it was that manipulated; it just turned out that way.\u201d\n\nVeteran Swift watchers are convinced this thing is real.\n\nDonovan, the Kansas professor who is writing a book tentatively titled Swiftie: An Anatomy of Fandom, acknowledges that going steady with Swift \u201cwill catapult (Kelce) to a new level.\u201d But he\u2019s observed the courtship and the romance from a close distance, beginning with Kelce\u2019s attempts to get a friendship bracelet with his phone number to Swift when the Eras tour came to Kansas City, to their postgame dates around town, to the \u201cTnT\u201d tennis bracelets (surprisingly affordable!) they exchanged and that Swift wore to the AFC championship game.\n\nSwift, believed to have reached billionaire status in recent months, could have spent Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve in any corner of the globe. Yet the Chiefs\u2019 schedule had them playing home games on both occasions.\n\nAnd so Swift was spotted not in New York or Rio or Milan for the holidays, but rather Arrowhead Stadium, with its picturesque view of 18-wheelers whizzing past on I-70 in Missouri.\n\n\u201cLittle details like that make me think it\u2019s a real relationship,\u201d says Donovan. \u201cThis is a love story.\u201d\n\nIt is a far simpler explanation than many kicking around various news ecosystems. That Taylor Swift is a psy-op. That a presidential endorsement is forthcoming. That the NFL is rigged. (If so, how much did they pay Buffalo Bills kicker Tyler Bass to push his game-tying field goal attempt wide right?)\n\nIt\u2019s all a little extra, particularly given Swift\u2019s relatively anodyne political stances. And it\u2019s perhaps a little ironic, given that the Swift-Kelce pop singer/football star union would seem to be the heteronormative Super Bowl for a political faction keen on rolling back rights for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n\u201cI think the right-wing political figures criticizing Taylor sound like the so-called 'beta males' they allegedly abhor,\u201d says Donovan. \u201cThat the 25 seconds they show Taylor on TV is causing this meltdown that\u2019s all out of proportion to the actual influence she has \u2013 on the game, the viewership.\u201d\n\nStepping into this maelstrom is Kelce, who in addition to blocking out that exterior noise must also not run afoul of the Swifties, who are most protective of their idol. Kelce is faster than any linebacker and bigger than any defensive back yet would be powerless to get bodied in song should the Swift union dissolve poorly.\n\nYet the upsides certainly outweigh the risk of an ignoble exit.\n\nElusive fame\n\nIn any celebrity pairing, there\u2019s almost always a power dynamic based on their relative fame. Whitler likens Swift-Kelce to the Tom Cruise-Nicole Kidman pairing, which bloomed out of their starring roles in 1990\u2019s \"Days of Thunder\" and subsequent marriage.\n\nWhile Kidman had a burgeoning and established acting career to that point \u2013 perhaps not fully analogous to Kelce\u2019s NFL exploits - her decadelong marriage to Cruise certainly amplified her reach.\n\nIn this modern era, the Swift Effect on Kelce is more measurable \u2013 and eye-opening.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened since September, when Taylor was first spotted at one of his games has really shot him into a new stratosphere as a celebrity,\u201d says Charles Rolston, senior consultant of client strategy at Navigate, a Chicago-based sports marketing firm.\n\nAs January turned to February, Rolston tracked a pair of 137-day time spans that we\u2019ll call Before Swift and After Swift, marked by the time she first showed up at a Chiefs game:\n\nBefore Swift: Kelce had 2.7 million Instagram followers and averaged 3,000 mentions a day across all media \u2013 TV, radio, online and social.\n\nAfter Swift: Kelce\u2019s Instagram following more than doubled to 5.7 million and he has averaged 35,000 mentions per day across media.\n\nIt also vaulted Kelce into an exclusive recognition rent district. A YouGov fourth-quarter survey placed Kelce\u2019s fame \u2013 or percentage of people who\u2019d heard of him \u2013 at 72%. That trails only Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (77%) and teammate Mahomes (75%) among active NFL players and puts him just behind NBA superstars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant (both 76%).\n\nIt\u2019s a particularly impressive feat given that Kelce\u2019s largest brand-building has occurred in the era of utter cultural stratification.\n\nRemember Snooki and Mike aka \"The Situation\" from the MTV hit Jersey Shore?\n\nRolston is quick to note that they haven\u2019t been relevant in roughly a decade, yet The Situation equals Kelce\u2019s 72% recognition rate while Snooki\u2019s 81% ranks higher than any active athlete besides LeBron James (94%) and Tiger Woods (93%). All trail Swift\u2019s 96%.\n\nYep, it\u2019s actually hard to be famous in the 21st century \u2013 but Kelce has a fighting chance.\n\n\u201cIn reality, there\u2019s still a long way to go to break through and get into that full A-list status. There\u2019s a big difference between where Kelce\u2019s at and where Taylor\u2019s at,\u201d says Rolston. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t hurt Taylor and in turn get the Swifties unleashing on him, I think he does have that cultural blank check.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s done all the right things already.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, get ready to adjust those numbers. The Super Bowl will almost certainly surpass the record 115 million who watched the 2023 game. With the rest of the NFL in hibernation, Kelce will surpass more peers in recognition, what with the Eras Tour returning stateside, Swift's new album due in April and the tight end exchanging his red jersey for the red carpet.\n\nAnd come fall, it will be even harder to get into Donovan\u2019s class at Kansas, the pop star still not finding her ceiling \u2013 while raising it for the local hero.\n\n\u201cI think ambitious people find other ambitious people attractive,\u201d he says, \u201cand they are combining their joint cultural capital into something huge. And I think he is pondering life after the NFL.\n\n\u201cAnd having the world\u2019s most famous person as your girlfriend can only help you in whatever career you decide to go into.\u201d"}

But he can\u2019t expand the operating room to provide those services without more money.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a surgeon that\u2019s willing to do it. My facility isn\u2019t big enough,\u201d Stansbury said. \u201cAnd urgent services like obstetrics I can\u2019t do in my hospital, because my facility won\u2019t meet code.\u201d Locals currently must travel 100 miles to deliver babies.\n\nRural hospitals throughout the nation are facing a similar conundrum. Most were opened with funding from the Hill-Burton Act, passed by Congress in 1946. By 1997, that and its successor program had funded the construction of nearly 7,000 hospitals and clinics. Now, many of those buildings, particularly those in rural areas, are in dire need of improvements.\n\nBut rural hospitals don\u2019t have the resources of larger hospitals, particularly those in hospital chains, to fund billion-dollar expansions.\n\n\u201cMost of us are operating at very low margins, if any margin at all,\u201d said Stansbury, who is also board chair of the Colorado Hospital Association. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling to find the money.\u201d\n\nRural hospital closures dropped during the pandemic, from a record-high 18 in 2020 to eight in 2021 and 2022 combined, according to the University of North Carolina\u2013Chapel Hill, as emergency relief funds kept them open. But that life support has ended.\n\nThose financial headwinds will likely push more rural hospitals out of business. At least nine more rural hospitals closed in 2023. Harold Miller, CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, said closures are reverting to pre-pandemic rates.\n\nThe challenges: time, Medicare, loans\n\nIncreased costs \u2013 payroll, inflation \u2013 amid lower payments from insurance make it harder for small hospitals to fund capital improvements. And rising interest rates are making it tougher for aging facilities to qualify for loans to upgrade their facilities to meet ever-changing standards of medical care.\n\nMiller said the biggest problem for small rural hospitals is that private insurance is no longer covering the full cost of care. Medicare Advantage, a program under which Medicare pays private plans to provide coverage, is a major contributor, he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re basically taking patients away from what may be the best payer that the small hospital has,\u201d Miller said. The private plan pays less and \u201cends up also using a variety of techniques to deny claims.\u201d\n\nRural hospitals must staff their emergency rooms with physicians round-the-clock, but the hospitals get paid only if someone comes in.\n\nNow what?What if the ambulance doesn't come? Rural America faces a broken emergency medical system\n\nScarce careInside America\u2019s rural maternal health care crisis: Why are women of color most at risk?\n\nThen there\u2019s the time crunch. Rural hospital CEOs must search for funding while running a hospital, said Kristin Juliar, a capital resources consultant for the National Organization of State Offices of Rural Health.\n\n\u201cA lot of times when there are funding opportunities, for example, the timing may be just too tight for them to put together a project,\u201d Juliar said. Some opportunities require hospitals to raise matching funds, which may be difficult in distressed rural communities.\n\nRural hospitals might not be very attractive to private lenders because of their financial constraints, and thus may have to pay higher interest rates, said Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer for the National Rural Health Association.\n\nAnother concern is that hospitals might invest in new facilities and end up shutting down anyway. Miller said only a small portion of rural hospitals might be able to make a meaningful difference to their bottom lines by adding services.\n\nPolicy solutions to help rural hospitals in progress\n\nLawmakers have tried to help. California, for example, has loan programs charging low to no interest in which rural hospitals can participate. Hospital representatives are urging Colorado legislators to approve similar support.\n\nAt the federal level, Rep. Yadira Caraveo, a Colorado Democrat, has introduced the bipartisan Rural Health Care Facilities Revitalization Act, which would help rural hospitals get more funding for capital projects through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA has been one of the largest funders of rural development through its Community Facilities Programs. In 2019, half of the more than $10 billion in outstanding loans through the program helped health care facilities.\n\nCaraveo\u2019s bill would also allow hospitals to refinance loans at lower interest rates, and would cover more categories of medical equipment, such as telehealth devices and technology.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep these places open, even not just for emergencies, but to deliver babies, to have your cardiology appointment,\u201d said Caraveo, who is also a pediatrician. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to drive two, three hours to get it.\u201d\n\nNo time to wait\n\nLincoln Community Hospital opened in 1959 after soldiers coming back from World War II decided they needed a hospital. They donated money, materials, land and labor. The hospital has added four family practice clinics, a skilled nursing facility and an assisted living center.\n\nStansbury would like to build a new hospital roughly double the size of the current 45,000-square-foot facility. With inflation easing and interest rates likely to go down, Stansbury hopes to get financing lined up in 2024 and to break ground in 2025.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, every day I wake up, it gets more expensive,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen officials first contemplated building a new hospital three years ago, they estimated the cost at about $65 million. Now the estimate is $75 million.\n\n\u201cIf we have to wait another couple of years, we may be pushing up closer to $80 million,\u201d Stansbury said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it. I can\u2019t wait five years.\u201d\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2013 an independent source of health policy research, polling and journalism."}

The days get longer, the Earth gets warmer and a rodent in Pennsylvania does or does not see its shadow. Presidential election years have their own set of signs.\n\nThere have already been three statewide primaries this year. Iowa's Republican caucuses, New Hampshire's primaries and South Carolina's Democratic primary have all had their say. Nevada's holding both Democratic and Republican primaries Tuesday, with the Palmetto State's GOP primary following on Feb. 24.\n\nThose primaries and Super Tuesday, March 5, were to be the first big milestones of this election to get us excited. Except that isn't happening.\n\nIt doesn't feel like an election year at all \u2013 not yet at least. It all seems like a foregone conclusion. For millions of people, it is easy to turn off the television, log off social media and completely ignore the certainty of a Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden rematch in November. Voters are either bracing for that or avoiding reality entirely.\n\nRepublican voters decided early\n\nOn the Republican end, there should be legitimate competition. Instead, it's been all over the place, with Trump clearly taking precedent over candidates who aren't in the midst of gargantuan legal battles.\n\nIowa exemplified how people are feeling: 15% of Republican voters \u2013 about 110,000 people, less than the population of Cedar Rapids \u2013 showed up in record-breaking temperatures to cast their votes. It was the lowest turnout since 2000.\n\nNew Hampshire was a drastically different story. A record number of Republican ballots were cast in the late January election, and Trump performed better than he had in 2016. He actually set a new record, more than 166,000 votes \u2013 the most of any candidate in the history of the Granite State's primaries (the record was previously held by Sen. Bernie Sanders's 152,000 votes).\n\nAt this point, Nikki Haley is the only Republican going against Trump, and he's soaring past her in every poll. It doesn't mean she should drop out, but the writing is on the wall. The majority of Republicans want to see Trump as their presidential nominee in spite of the turmoil he has created, and there isn't any stopping his return to the presidential race.\n\nMAGA and Taylor Swift:Really? With all the problems this country is facing Taylor Swift is what's angering MAGA?\n\nDemocrats are still holding primaries\n\nWhile Republicans accept the reality of Trump, the Democratic Party is either collectively sleeping or patting themselves on the back for just getting through the next few months. They've only had two primaries, but you're lying to yourself if you believe anyone but Biden was going to be the nominee.\n\nYes, there have been countless articles over the past few years as to whether it would be wise for the president to seek reelection in 2024. He told donors back in December that he wasn't even sure he would be running again if not for The Trump Thing.\n\nBiden wasn't even on the ballot in the New Hampshire primary after a dispute over the day of the election. A write-in campaign secured him the nomination there, with about 80,000 votes. He won South Carolina with more than 96% of the vote.\n\nLike it or not, it's happening:Biden vs. Trump inevitable rematch will test the strength and patience of America\n\nIs the average voter paying attention yet?\n\nBoth nominees could be picked without the average American even noticing.\n\nIt's not like 2020, where a crowded Democratic primary kept the nation engaged every step of the way. Biden is simply going to be the nominee, and we're all aware of it.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has reshaped the GOP until it no longer can exist without him. He's been victorious in spite of his legal troubles and will continue to be victorious because of the cult of personality he has amassed over a lifetime, and especially in the past eight years.\n\nIf it feels like the election year isn't in full force yet, it's because it isn't. We still have 47 states to go, plus South Carolina Republicans and Iowa Democrats who still need to cast ballots. But let's not kid ourselves \u2013 we know who the two nominees are going to be at this point and people have just accepted it.\n\nA recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that more than half of U.S. adults would be \"dissatisfied\" with either Biden or Trump as their respective party nominees. Unfortunately, the rematch nobody wanted is the rematch we're all about to get.\n\nIn the meantime, we can watch Haley and Trump exchange insults until she drops out. We will look for Biden as he begins to think about how he wants to attack the upcoming election as an incumbent, albeit an unpopular one. Then, all we can do is wait for the real battle.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Sara Peque\u00f1o on X, formerly Twitter, @sara__pequeno and Facebook facebook.com/PequenoWrites"}

Meanwhile, Swifties are wondering whether Taylor Swift will make it to the championship game to cheer on the Chiefs' Travis Kelce after she wraps up tour dates in Japan.\n\nCelebrities aside, Nevada voters will also make their voices heard in February. The state will have two presidential nominating contests this week \u2013 a primary on Tuesday required by state law and a caucus on Thursday organized by the Nevada GOP.\n\nFor Democrats, with an incumbent president on the ballot, it will be a straightforward and likely low-drama affair.\n\nThe Nevada GOP, meanwhile, will honor only the winner of the caucus with delegates. The party has said any candidate who signs up for the primary would be barred from the caucus.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIf you're confused about the dueling Republican races, don't worry. The elections have prompted confusion and criticism from many corners, but here's what you need to know:\n\nWhen is the Nevada caucus?\n\nThe Nevada Republican Party will hold an in-person caucus Feb. 8 at various precinct locations around the state.\n\nGet details on how to participate in the Republican caucus at nevadaGOP.org/2024-presidential-caucus.\n\nWho\u2019s running in the Nevada caucus?\n\nRepublican candidates who have registered for the caucus include former President Donald Trump and several candidates who have long since dropped out of the race, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Only Texas Pastor Ryan Binkley is going up against Trump.\n\nWhen is the Nevada primary?\n\nThe presidential preference primary is Feb. 6, with early voting starting Jan. 27. Only registered Republicans and Democrats can particiapte.\n\nIt will be structured like a typical election with sample ballots mailed out, mail-in ballots as the default and electronic voting at many of the usual vote centers.\n\nWho\u2019s on the Nevada primary ballot?\n\nOn the Republican side, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is on the ballot, along with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and former Vice President Mike Pence, both of whom have dropped out of the race. John Castro, Heath Fulkerson, Hirsh Singh and Donald Kjornes round out the Republican ballot.\n\nIf you're registered as a Democrat in Nevada, your ballot will include President Joe Biden, challenger Marianne Williamson and less-well-known candidates Armando Perez-Serrato, Brent Foutz, Stephen Lyons, Jason Palmer, Donald Picard, Stephen Leon, John Haywood, Gabriel Cornejo, Frank Lozada, Superpayaseria Crystalroc and Mark Prascak.\n\n\u201cNone of these candidates\u201d will also be a choice on statewide primary ballots.\n\nWhy is Trump not on the Nevada primary ballot?\n\nTrump registered to run in the Nevada caucus, rather than the Nevada presidential preference primary, after the state's Republican Party announced it would not send delegates to the Republican National Convention based on results from the primary.\n\nThat means only the GOP caucus has the power to move a candidate closer to winning the Republican nomination.\n\nWhy does Nevada have a caucus and a primary?\n\nIn 2021, the Nevada Legislature approved a change to make way for a presidential primary. It was intended to be a simpler way to pick the preferred presidential candidates for the two major parties.\n\nHowever, the Nevada Republican Party balked at the new format and went in another direction. Instead of sending delegates to the GOP National Convention based on primary results, the party will consider only results from its Feb. 8 caucus, which it will host and pay for itself.\n\nThe party says the caucus embodies the election reforms it seeks, such as the use of voter ID, a single election day with no early voting, paper ballots and less influence from super PACs.\n\nIs it too late to register to vote in Nevada?\n\nFortunately, no. Nevada allows same-day voter registration and registration changes. To do either of these, you will need to vote in person at a vote center. If you haven't voted before, you will need to provide a government-issued ID and cast a provisional ballot that won\u2019t be counted until it\u2019s verified that you meet the requirements of voter registration."}

Chapman\u2019s self-titled new album was on heavy rotation in stereo stores. The crisp, clean sound she created was everything you wanted out of a speaker.\n\nHer music \u2013 especially \"Fast Car\" \u2013 sold me on that stereo. And that stereo\u2019s speakers sold me on Chapman\u2019s CD.\n\nIt wasn't just sound. It was the words.\n\nI had recently finished an African American literature course at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. Our professor frequently underscored the prevalence of \u201cflying away\u201d in Black authors\u2019 works. With what little I knew of Black Americans\u2019 experiences, I could still understand why you would want to take flight.\n\n\u201cIs it fast enough so we can fly away,\u201d Chapman sang so soulfully about a different, hopeful life in that car.\n\nFlash-forward a couple decades to 2012 or 2013. I pulled out that same CD and shared it with my youngest son. I found it funny how frequently he asked to replay \"Fast Car\" and wanted to know more about the album.\n\nHis musical tastes broadened. His friends turned him on to Top 40 country music. And before long he was trying to get me to listen. Alternative music and rock were my thing. I laughed at him, but I gave country a shot during a few car rides.\n\nBefore long, I started really listening. Underneath the catchy melodies were wildly creative and fun plays on words.\n\n'Fast Car' in country music:Could a Black, queer woman top country music charts? She didn't \u2013 but her song did.\n\nIn his song \"Whiskey Glasses,\" Morgan Wallen paints a picture of a forlorn guy sitting at a bar hoping to drink away his girl problems. He sets up several great lines, but this phrase says it: \u201cI'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof. And see the world through whiskey glasses.\u201d\n\nEscape, again. Perhaps a hope for a new future.\n\nAnd then Wallen didn\u2019t make his \"Saturday Night Live\" gig because he flaunted COVID-19 protocols. And then he said some racist things. And then I couldn\u2019t admit to listening to him anymore. And then I didn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s through that lens I heard two people in recent weeks on NPR discussing the scarcity of Black voices \u2013 especially Black women \u2013 in country music. The discussion turned to Wallen\u2019s racism and to Combs. They said they felt like Combs completely co-opted Chapman\u2019s song. Had he also muscled away a longtime LGBTQ+ anthem, too?\n\nAt that moment driving in my car, I took those music experts for their words: that a daunting, racial barrier exists between Black artists and the country music industry. A barrier that's not unlike those remaining in many other Americans' lives.\n\nReally? Taylor Swift is angering MAGA?Donald Trump can't help being jealous of Taylor Swift \u2013 and it shows.\n\nWatching Chapman and Combs sing offers some hope\n\nBut then Sunday night, Combs starts talking about his childhood in an introductory video. He said \"Fast Car\" was his \u201cfavorite song before I knew what a favorite song was.\u201d\n\nA kid just listening to a good song.\n\nAnd then there they were on the stage: Chapman and Combs.\n\nWas every racial or socioeconomic issue solved in those few minutes? Of course not.\n\nBut a Black woman and a white man sang together about people down on their luck and dreaming of better lives. Maybe we saw that our troubles and dreams can connect us, how much more we could accomplish together. And maybe the politics and other divisions faded \u2013 at least for those few moments.\n\nI hope my tears Sunday night were of joy for what potential still lies ahead and not that common ground is so far gone I just want to fly away.\n\nJim Sergent is a USA TODAY graphics editor."}

The exact match structure depends on company policy, and employees would have to certify annually they made qualifying student loan payments.\n\nA simple example is if your company offers a 4% 401(k) match for contributions, you could make a student loan payment and get a dollar-for-dollar match up to 4% of your salary.\n\nKeep in mind the student loan matching program mirrors the 401(k)-match benefit, so the match percentage, eligibility, and vesting rules are the same. Vesting means that you may have to stay at your company for a certain length of time or risk losing some or all your match from your employer. If all your retirement savings are from matching and you\u2019re not fully vested, you could lose some or all of those savings.\n\nWill more companies offer student loan matching in 2024?\n\nAs we move further into 2024, Voya's Armstrong said he expects more companies to consider this benefit. \u201cThere\u2019s not massive adoption, but there\u2019s increasing levels of interest,\u201d he said.\n\n\"If the student debt crisis continues to be a crisis, student loan benefits of some type will be common at companies, but I'm not sure it will be this one,\" said Stacey MacPhetres, senior director of education finance at Bright Horizons, which provides educational advisory services to organizations and families.\n\nAvoidance may be the best strategy:Student loan debt: How 5 people went to school and avoided it\n\nCompanies offer other student loan help\n\nSome companies already help employees pay down student loans and don\u2019t feel the need to change their benefits. Others say their employees want immediate help paying down their student loans and prefer direct payments to whittle down their balances instead of a retirement match, MacPhetres said.\n\nThrough 2025, employers can offer up to $5,250 in student loan repayment benefits tax free, thanks to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. Last October, 34% of employers offered student loan benefits, up from 17% in 2021, according to human resources software company Paycor.\n\nSome businesses also offer student loan payment counseling and third-party, low-interest or interest-free educational loans along with debt consolidation and refinancing services.\n\nCompanies like Staples, Fidelity, Chegg, Connelly Partners, ChowNow, and First Republic Bank offer some of these options.\n\nHow many people can benefit from corporate student loan assistance?\n\nAbout 45 million Americans have student loans collectively worth $1.75 trillion.\n\nOf the 22 million borrowers who had payments due in October after the student loan payment pause ended, 60% missed their payments, according to the Department of Education.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

And Israel must also undergo its own \u201cregime change\u201d \u2014 a repudiation of not only Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but also his far-right government. Netanyahu and his government presided over what nearly became a civil war over democracy, left the country vulnerable to the worst slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust, propounded racist rhetoric that gave Israel\u2019s enemies a toehold to accuse it of genocide in the International Criminal Court, failed to perform basic social services and lost the confidence of the country in management of the war.\n\nA poll taken in January showed \u201cthe Likud Party would drop to an unprecedented low of only 16 seats if elections were held today,\u201d the Jerusalem Post reported. Since then, protests against Netanyahu and the government have only increased.\n\nAs the Times of Israel reported, \u201cSpeeches at the weekly Tel Aviv rally demanding the return of hostages held in Gaza took a more strongly political tone than ever before on Saturday night, with speakers accusing the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being indifferent to the hostages\u2019 fate and Netanyahu of being guided by personal considerations and stalling to avoid investigations and elections.\u201d Ronen Manelis, a reserves brigadier general and former Israel Defense Forces spokesperson, was quoted as saying, \u201cThe discourse taking place in recent days, the leaks, the manipulations, the lack of leadership, the inability to make difficult decisions, is leading to some difficult questions about the loss of commitment by the state to its citizens; [about whether] considerations outside this commitment are influencing the decision-making, or the absence thereof.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOusting Netanyahu and his even-more-extreme coalition partners (who have taken to condemning President Biden, who remains popular with Israelis for his self-described pro-Zionism outlook and support during the war) is no easy matter. As long as Netanyahu\u2019s coalition sticks together, he will remain in power. The notion that he would step down voluntarily after Oct. 7 has faded. Even the harsh judgment of a postwar investigatory commission might not dislodge him.\n\nAside from a vote of no confidence, there are only a handful of mechanisms that would eject him from government. His corruption trial might result in a criminal verdict or a plea bargain that requires him to step down. The entire military and intelligence community leadership could resign, leaving him as the sole person responsible for Oct. 7 still in power. Alternatively, intensified public protests culminating in a general strike might finally force him to step down.\n\nFollow this author Jennifer Rubin 's opinions Follow\n\nThere are serious limitations with each. None is likely to happen immediately, certainly not while the war is ongoing. Moreover, there is no guarantee that Netanyahu would leave voluntarily or that his coalition would crumble even if everyone else in the national security apparatus steps down and a general strike proceeds. And the progress of the much-delayed criminal trial remains uncertain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question then remains whether the United States can hasten Netanyahu\u2019s removal. The U.S. record of ousting hostile regimes by military power or secret coup is atrocious, but the Biden administration and Congress can assist domestic forces in Israel to accelerate Netanyahu\u2019s departure.\n\nCutting off aid to Israel is a poor tool to obtain this result. Such action would allow Netanyahu to play the victim and seek refuge with his far-right allies. However, slowing aid delivery could make clear that Netanyahu\u2019s presence harms Israel\u2019s essential relationship with the United States. NBC News recently reported, \u201cAfter weeks of private administration requests produced fewer results than the White House wants \u2026 the U.S. is considering slowing or pausing the deliveries in the hope that doing so will prod the Israelis to take action, such as opening humanitarian corridors to provide more aid to Palestinian civilians.\u201d\n\nThe report continued, \u201cThe effort comes after weeks of President Joe Biden and his national security team failing to convince Netanyahu and other Israeli officials to dramatically change tactics in Gaza and to take more steps to minimize civilian casualties, officials said. It marks a potential shift in Biden\u2019s approach by going beyond rhetorical pressure, largely behind the scenes, and to making tangible policy changes aimed at getting Israel to act.\u201d Making clear that Netanyahu\u2019s policies necessitate this might sharpen the divide between him and military commanders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Biden administration also could increase consultation with and lift up the voices of opposition figures, hostage families and protesters (engaging in publicly announced meetings with them, for instance) to emphasize that the United States stands foursquare behind efforts to bring fighting to an end, obtain return of the hostages, prevent Israeli \u201cresettlement\u201d of Gaza and support regional peace efforts by Israel\u2019s neighbors. And, conversely, the administration could step up criticism of the racist rhetoric from Netanyahu\u2019s coalition partners and decline to block any Security Council resolutions condemning such remarks."}

It\u2019s more than creativity, adaptability, drive, intangibles or trust. It\u2019s more than confidence, which allows him to break so many conventional rules of playing quarterback (and so many records). Sometimes, when words aren\u2019t enough, we turn to video; maybe analyzing will help us understand. But in this case, even the flashiest highlights are insufficient. What makes Mahomes great is more than even his acts of greatness themselves.\n\nThe most impressive thing about Patrick Mahomes isn\u2019t what he does. It\u2019s what he doesn\u2019t do.\n\nSkip to end of carousel Super Bowl LVIII Follow our coverage, everything to know. Sunday, Feb. 11, kickoff: 6:30 p.m. ET (CBS) End of carousel\n\nMahomes rarely makes negative plays. He does bad things at a lower rate than just about every other quarterback in the NFL, which unlocks everything else. That might sound elementary, but it\u2019s remarkable given all the chances he takes and all the Kansas City Chiefs ask of him. Ultimately, his superpower is on-the-run risk management, maximizing his immense natural talent while minimizing the ways his gun-slinging can burn the team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gift,\u201d Chiefs right tackle Jawaan Taylor said.\n\nThe Chiefs\u2019 run this postseason is a perfect example. Mahomes hasn\u2019t vanquished foes with physical brilliance. In three games, he has topped 300 total yards once (barely) and scored just four touchdowns. But he has complemented the Chiefs\u2019 dominant defense by protecting the ball and battling for field position. He has dropped back 112 times and has had zero interceptions and zero fumbles and taken two sacks for a grand total of 11 yards.\n\nIn the run-up to Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl against San Francisco and Brock Purdy, his counterpart on the 49ers, the wrong quarterback might be getting the label of \u201cgame manager.\u201d\n\nYet this is who Mahomes has always been. He has had one of the lowest rates of negative plays (interceptions, sacks and fumbles) every season since he became the starter in 2018. In 2023, it was 6.8 percent, the lowest in the NFL, and even when Mahomes did make mistakes, the advanced stats suggest they hurt less than the average negative play. This Chiefs team, with the feeblest offense of his era, has taught him the value of patience, of sometimes playing for field position rather than points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have that mentality where I want to score every single time,\u201d he said after beating Miami in the first round of the playoffs. \u201cI played in the Big 12 [Conference]; I want to score every single time. But when your defense is playing [well] like that, you have to find the best way to win the football game.\u201d\n\nBy now, defensive coordinators have a standard game plan for Mahomes: They mostly play zone coverage, often with two high safeties, and don\u2019t blitz. The conservative approach aims to slow Mahomes, not beat him. If he grows impatient, if he tries to play hero ball, defenses can create a negative play. The ploy worked for the 49ers in Super Bowl LIV; Mahomes had two fumbles and two picks and was sacked four times. But the Chiefs won anyway, which was an anomaly; when Mahomes has had negative plays in the postseason, they\u2019ve historically been his team\u2019s kryptonite.\n\nIn 17 playoff games, Mahomes has had five or more negative plays four times. He has lost every game except that Super Bowl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Kansas City signed journeyman Blaine Gabbert to back up Mahomes. Gabbert spent the previous three seasons in Tampa with Tom Brady. But during his first practice with the Chiefs, Gabbert saw what made Mahomes special.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cHe has a very unique ability to see the field outside the pocket; he\u2019s one of one with the ability to do that,\u201d Gabbert said. \u201cHis field of vision is phenomenal; his play-extending ability is phenomenal.\u201d\n\nOne day, Gabbert said, he asked Mahomes how he saw passing windows on the run. The best Mahomes could say was that he \u201cfeels space,\u201d that breaking the pocket turns football into basketball, that he\u2019s essentially running pick and rolls with tight end Travis Kelce. Gabbert called Mahomes \u201ca unicorn\u201d \u2014 not just for his vision but for how he\u2019s able to use it.\n\nMaybe the best way to capture Mahomes\u2019s magic is during broken plays. He\u2019s calm in chaos, avoiding defenders by sprinting, juking, spinning, stepping up or rolling out. He can look like a contortionist with 360-degree vision. But Washington Commanders right tackle Andrew Wylie, who blocked for Mahomes for five seasons, said it starts with understanding what the defense wants to do before the snap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe would go into the blitz meeting and essentially run the show,\u201d Wylie said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool. His ability to recognize coverages, pressures, certain alignments by different guys lets him get the ball out quick, like he knows where his [answers] are.\u201d\n\nMahomes\u2019s spatial awareness and athleticism allow him to extend plays without taking many sacks. Sacks are subtler negatives than turnovers but torpedo drives. Mahomes dances away from pressure by pump-faking rushers or jumping to buy himself an extra split second \u2014 and then he has the arm fluidity and core strength to complete a pass.\n\nIn the past decade, no quarterback has been better at avoiding sacks when pressured, per data from TruMedia.\n\n\u201cThe tough part about Patrick Mahomes is it\u2019s not the first three seconds of a play,\u201d Denver safety Justin Simmons said. \u201cYou can probably cover that. It\u2019s the next three seconds, when he extends it and keeps it alive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the last time Mahomes lost in the playoffs, in the AFC championship game against Cincinnati in January 2022, he has dramatically cut down on negative plays. In six games \u2014 223 dropbacks \u2014 he has five sacks, one fumble and no interceptions. It has been a key part of his growth and of taking this Chiefs team this far.\n\nIn the locker room after beating Miami, Gabbert said Kansas City\u2019s game plan emphasized field position because the wind chill was minus-30. The Chiefs struggled in the red zone but made field goals from 21, 26, 28 and 32 yards. On that day, it was enough.\n\n\u201cPart of playing the position of quarterback is not to take negative plays, especially in the game that we just had,\u201d he said."}

Am I bored or sad? How will eating that food make me feel? Judson Brewer, a psychiatrist, neuroscientist and director of research and innovation at Brown University\u2019s Mindfulness Center, offers this guidance as part of a 21-day strategy to conquer habitual eating and instead learn to listen to your body\u2019s cues. These questions, Brewer says, help people focus on what they actually need, vs. what they want.\n\nThe Washington Post recently spoke with Dr. Brewer about his new book, \u201cThe Hunger Habit: Why We Eat When We\u2019re Not Hungry, and How to Stop.\u201d We spoke about how his plan can help with habits like stress and binge eating, as well as the role of willpower and curiosity in changing habits. Here\u2019s what he had to say.\n\nWhat role does willpower play in the effort to improve eating habits?\n\n\u201cFrom a neuroscience standpoint, willpower is not even part of the equation when it comes to behavior change,\" said Brewer.\n\n\u201cThe dominant paradigm is that people feel like they just need more willpower,\" said Brewer. \u201cAnd so every six months, there\u2019s a new theme, whether it\u2019s a new diet or a new plan or a new this or that that requires willpower. People feel ashamed of themselves because they feel like there\u2019s something wrong with them.\u201d\n\nSimply knowing what we \u201cshould\u201d be doing is also often not enough to make us change behavior either. Brewer notes that we\u2019ve all been inundated with messages that fresh, whole, minimally processed foods and regular exercise are the foundations of health, yet so many of us continue to struggle. \u201cThe knowing is not enough because that\u2019s not where behavior change happens,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cThe feeling is where behavior change happens and so we have to actually get reacquainted with \u2014 I would say, reconnected with \u2014 our bodies and then start listening to them.\u201d\n\nHow can mindfulness help?\n\nMindfulness is a term that essentially means bringing awareness to the present moment without judgment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would start with the why,\" said Brewer. \u201cWhy am I reaching for food? Am I actually hungry or is it something else? And if it\u2019s not hungry, it\u2019s indicating some type of a habit that we can then delve into.\"\n\nThe early science evaluating the approach is limited. A small study of 104 overweight and obese adult women showed a 40 percent decrease in craving-related eating among overweight or obese women who followed his month-long, mindfulness-based program on their smartphones.\n\nAmong those who completed the program in three months, having fewer cravings resulted in weight loss. The study was small and far from conclusive. (Brewer disclosed that he owns stock in Claritas MindSciences, the company that produced the app used in the study.)\n\nWhile the evidence is still out on how effective mindfulness interventions might be, Brewer notes that some people find it enormously helpful and a better approach than restrictive diets. And while it may not result in significant weight loss, it can give people the tools they need to cope with cravings and change unhealthy habits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had a patient who used to eat an entire bag of potato chips every night,\" Brewer said. \u201cAnd so I had her pay attention. I said, \u2018just pay attention as you eat and see how many potato chips are enough.\u2019 She stopped at two. I was blown away. I call her my two potato chip lady.\u201d\n\nHow can we change our eating habits?\n\nBrewer calls part of the brain\u2019s reward system, notably, the workings of a region called the orbitofrontal cortex, \u201cthe decider.\u201d If you feel bad, the brain can remind us that eating can feel good, and blot out bad feelings, if only temporarily. In this system, \u201ccake beats broccoli; cake beats boredom; cake beats bad feelings.\u201d\n\nBut Brewer says we can change our habits by changing their position in the reward hierarchy through experience. Essentially, his plan involves three steps:\n\nShare this article Share\n\nMap out your eating patterns and habit loops\n\nChange the \u201creward value\u201d of eating behavior in our brains\n\nFinding more rewarding behaviors that make the body feel content.\n\nAs an example, Brewer offers his own addiction to gummy worms, which he downed by the bagful. After many years, he finally began thinking about their feel and taste, and realized they were sickly sweet and tasted like rubber. He replaced that long-entrenched habit with blueberries. For others, he suggests, a replacement habit might be enjoying a few squares of dark chocolate.\n\nHow do you change the reward value of food?\n\n\u201cBrains are prediction machines,\u201d he said. Our brains review the past to navigate the future. Pause and ask yourself: What happened the last time I ate the pint of ice cream, the whole pizza or chocolate cake? Remembering, in detail, the stuffed gut and visceral unpleasantness will help to develop a sense of disenchantment and over time, as we catalog the uncomfortable physical sensations associated with overeating, its reward value drops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s ever come back to me and said, \u2018Boy, I didn\u2019t realize how great it feels to overeat,\u2019\u201d Brewer said. \u201cNobody has ever said that.\u201d\n\nBrewer says this kind of focus is the beginning of disrupting a pattern. \u201cIt only takes 10 to 15 times of doing that for us to build up enough of a database to remember that for the next time,\u201d he said. After becoming disenchanted with a certain food or pattern of behavior, the brain is ready for a change.\"\n\nHow do you cope with food cravings?\n\nOver time, as you become more aware that cravings and urges are simply sensations in the body, Brewer says, you can learn to ride them out. To do this, Brewer developed a practice known by its acronym, RAIN:\n\nRecognize and relax into the cravings you are feeling\n\nAccept and allow those feelings to be there\n\nInvestigate your physical sensations, emotions and thoughts with curiosity and kindness\n\nNote what is going on in each moment\n\nHe says in his years of research, the longest craving anyone has reported was 12 minutes.\n\nHow does using curiosity help?\n\nA typical pattern when it comes to binge or stress eating is to beat oneself up after an episode, and frame it as a screw-up, Brewer says:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrewer suggests flipping the paradigm to embrace a \u201cgrowth mind-set.\u201d \u201cInstead of saying, \u2018Oh, no, I screwed up.\u2019 I go, \u2018Oh, well, that didn\u2019t work.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat allows for curiosity to proliferate and creates space to learn from the experience, he asys. \u201cOften we learn more from tripping up than when things go well, and so we can actually shift our mind-set to like, \u2018I\u2019m going to learn from everything, no matter what.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat role can mindfulness play when using a weight loss drug?\n\nBrewer\u2019s book doesn\u2019t discuss the new \u201cGLP-1\u201d drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, which can drastically suppress food cravings and drive dramatic weight loss. But, he says, his mindfulness-based approach remains a readily accessible tool that can be used in conjunction with medication if needed.\n\n\u201cWhat I would say with the GLP -1 drugs is the jury is still out in terms of long-term effects,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the jury is not out on is how our brains learn. So regardless of whatever the GLP -1 or the next generation of drugs are going to be, we still have to know how our brains work, and we still have to learn to work with our brains.\u201d"}

Choose your plan ArrowRight \u201cI don\u2019t wanna embarrass this young lady,\u201d he said, referring to Queen B, who sat nearby in the audience. \u201cBut she has more Grammys than anyone, but never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn\u2019t work. Think about that: the most Grammys, never won album of the year.\u201d\n\nJay-Z\u2019s remarks are a reminder that despite a blockbuster album and a six-month-long, 56-stop world tour, Beyonc\u00e9 once again did not receive album of the year. She has been overlooked eight times for record of the year, and four times for album of the year. On Sunday, Taylor Swift took home the best album honor for the fourth time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s latest snub is also a painful reminder that despite Black women\u2019s huge influence in music and culture, no Black woman has won album of the year since Lauryn Hill in 1999. That\u2019s 25 years.\n\nFollow this author Karen Attiah 's opinions Follow\n\nPeople disagree about whether Black artists should care about Grammys, Oscars or any other markers of success given by majority-White institutions. Either way, though Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s achievements as a musician and businesswoman are obvious, she remains an symbol of White limits on Black female success.\n\nI\u2019ve written before about these limits on Beyonc\u00e9, about how though her music carries the aesthetics of liberation and capitalistic success, and despite her silence on big issues, she remained underlauded. Last year, a group of anonymous Grammy voters said that Beyonc\u00e9 got passed over for album of the year because she wins too much, and when \u201cshe does something new, it\u2019s a big event and everyone\u2019s supposed to quake in their shoes \u2014 it\u2019s a little too portentous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes this bother her? Apparently so, as she has mentioned how tough it is to be a Black woman in the industry. And yet Beyonc\u00e9 is usually silent about specifics.\n\nOther Black female celebrities have lately been vocal about their mistreatment by the entertainment industry. Actor Taraji P. Henson went public, breaking down in tears as she described being paid much less than their peers and offered less roles. Viola Davis has also talked about having similar career trajectories as Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Sigourney Weaver, but being paid a fraction of what they are paid.\n\nSo, the question is: will Beyonc\u00e9 herself ever say \u2014 or do \u2014 anything about it? It\u2019s probably time, no?\n\nCertainly, her husband didn\u2019t hesitate on Sunday. Nor did Kanye West, during that famous moment at the 2009 Video Music Awards when he interrupted Swift and stated that Beyonc\u00e9 deserved the award for best video by a female artist instead. West was roundly criticized at the time, accused of stealing Swift\u2019s moment. It would be understandable if Beyonc\u00e9 personally doesn\u2019t want any of that smoke \u2014 especially from Swift\u2019s powerful, mostly White fanbase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe part of Brand Beyonc\u00e9 is staying silent and gracious, while other men speak onstage in her defense. I get it, I suppose. But I can\u2019t help but think it would be far more powerful if Beyonc\u00e9 herself called out the industry, or boycotted the Grammys, as other Black artists have done.\n\nJay-Z boycotted the Grammys for a long time over its treatment of hip-hop music. In 1989, after winning the first-ever rap Grammy, Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff decided to boycott the show when they learned that their acceptance wouldn\u2019t be broadcast live. \u201cThey said there wasn\u2019t enough time to televise all of the categories,\u201d Jazzy Jeff told the media at the time. \u201cThey televised 16 categories and, from record sales, from the Billboard charts, from the overall public\u2019s view, there\u2019s no way you can tell me that out of 16 categories, that rap isn\u2019t in the top 16.\u201d\n\nThis year, rapper Meek Mill took to social media to express his disappointment in the Grammys. \u201cGrammys is not the play!\u201d he said in a tweet. Other artists have charged that the academy has both ignored and exploited hip-hop for 50 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlways stay gracious/Best revenge is your paper\u201d is the last line from a Beyonc\u00e9 song titled \u201cFormation.\u201d Which I think is a clear signal that says she has the ticket sales, the cultural firepower and the bank accounts that serve as revenge of sorts. But when part of your brand and success is based on being personally silent about systemic injustice, she\u2019s between a rock and a glass ceiling. Is that a good place to be?"}

The contest, organized by the island of Gotland in Sweden, rewards those who turn over their yards to nature to save water and change the world\u2019s perception of the ideal lawn.\n\nIt also raises an important question: Who wants an ugly lawn, really? An admirable, dedicated contingent embracing ugly lawns\u2019 ecological bona fides is willing to draw \u201cdisgusted glances from neighbors \u2013 and a round of applause from around the globe,\u201d as the contest organizers put it.\n\nBut far more people just want a nice yard that won\u2019t provoke their neighborhood homeowners association (HOA).\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re saying we\u2019re all going to have the ugliest landscape in the world, that\u2019s not going to catch on,\u201d insists Doug Tallamy, an entomologist at the University of Delaware who\u2019s proposing a different approach. \u201cI\u2019m trying to reduce the area of lawn and do it in an attractive way so you\u2019re not thrown out of your neighborhood.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTallamy is part of a growing movement to create ecological Edens out of yards while keeping them palatable to society. Want an unruly meadow? Carve a path inviting you in. Planting a profusion of native trees and shrubs? Border it with a strip of manicured grass.\n\nThese subtle but crucial signals differentiate a mess from a \u201clawn.\u201d That might be enough to move wildlife conservation beyond public lands to the backyards \u2014 and even balconies \u2014 of millions of people, propagating tidy wildlands across the country.\n\n\u201cWe need ecosystems to function everywhere, not just in parks and preserves,\u201d he argues.\n\nHere\u2019s how to create a yard \u2014 or container garden \u2014 that\u2019s good for nature while making you the envy of your neighborhood.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve lost\n\nAmericans have transformed 95 percent of the natural landscapes in the country. Around half the Lower 48 states are now cities and streets, infrastructure such as airports and shopping centers, or isolated habitat fragments, with farms covering much of the other half.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly about 13 percent of the United States enjoys some form of protection.\n\nThat\u2019s hardly enough to sustain wildlife. If nearly three-quarters of habitat is lost, ecologists say, then we\u2019re likely to lose three-quarters of species as well. In just half a century, for example, a staggering 3 billion breeding adult birds, or nearly 30 percent of their populations, have disappeared.\n\nTo save America\u2019s biodiversity, Tallamy wants us to share the land. To do this, he\u2019s enlisting private owners of more than 83 percent of the United States to create what he calls \u201chomegrown national parks\u201d from tiny city plots to corporate campuses. He envisions turning over half of the 40 million acres of lawns in the United States \u2014 an area roughly the size of New England \u2014 to imperiled native plants and trees, embracing what Aldo Leopold, widely regarded as a father of modern conservation, called the \u201cland ethic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us,\u201d Leopold wrote in his 1949 book, \u201cA Sand County Almanac,\u201d popularizing the idea that healthy ecosystems are vital to humanity\u2019s survival. \u201cWhen we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect.\u201d\n\nThat means restoring four ecological functions that healthy landscapes perform: nourish the food web, supply clean water, pull carbon out of the air, and feed and shelter native insects and pollinators.\n\n\u201cLawns do none of them,\u201d says Tallamy. But they could, on almost any scale, including a tiny side yard or even a container.\n\nImagine your yard as a buffet. Insects evolved over millions of years to feast on hundreds of regional cuisines made up of native plants from Florida to the Pacific Northwest. Some, such as the monarch butterfly larvae, depend on a single endemic plant species. If all you have to offer are turf and ornamental plants, mostly from Asia and Europe, you might as well be growing AstroTurf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat leaves insects and everything that depends on them \u2014 including the roughly three-quarters of all the flowering plants on Earth they pollinate \u2014 out of luck. A 2019 study by Tallamy and others found hedgerows infested with invasive shrubs and trees supported 96 percent fewer caterpillars, by weight, than those dominated by natives\n\nSince so many animals eat caterpillars, says Tallamy, without them you have a failed food web.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nTidy wildlands that even the most conservative neighbor could celebrate could restore nature\u2019s banquet table, and all the wildlife that relies on it, across U.S. cities and suburbs.\n\nWhat the new yard could look like\n\nThe typical objection to \u201cnatural\u201d yards and native plants boils down to one word: \u201cmessy,\u201d says Haven Kiers, a landscape architect at the University of California at Davis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public perception of lawns is binary: clipped and manicured or abandoned and ugly. Kiers is charting a third way, transforming her own scraggly grass lawn in Davis into an explosive profusion of native plants combined with a few ornamentals that people and pollinators love.\n\n\u201cIt would be great if everyone planted only natives,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I\u2019m also dealing with a public that wants to do well and wants gardens to look good.\u201d\n\nSo she\u2019s designing native landscapes as formal gardens. Her students lay out elaborate botanical landscapes that draw on ordered garden styles while using only plants from the West. Ironically, this may mean reintroducing them to Americans in a new light. Our native plants such as pokeweed, American sweetgum and Virginia creeper are fixtures in formal gardens in Paris, and elsewhere in Europe. We just need to learn to love them as much they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe key is a landscape philosophy called \u201ccues to care.\u201d First introduced in a 1995 paper called \u201cMessy Ecosystems, Orderly Frames,\u201d it argued that intentionally-designed elements \u2014 mowed grass margins, flowering plants with crisp edges or trimmed shrubs \u2014 should delineate larger \u201cmessy\u201d wildness such as a meadow or prairie gardens. These signs of human presence make the landscapes socially acceptable, while preserving their ecological value, which is often invisible.\n\nUltimately, the lack of social acceptance is what makes the \u201cugly\u201d frame such a hard sell. Yards are not afterthoughts for most people. They are status symbols and artistic expressions. To make native landscapes acceptable, we need to marry human touch with ecological function.\n\nHow to create a tidy wildland\n\nTake it one small patch at a time. Kiers recommends slowly replacing strips of lawn with native (or a few suitable ornamental) plants that can support pollinators and local fauna. For Kiers, the backyard is a work in progress. With each passing year, her grass recedes as her garden beds and natives grow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you\u2019re worried about HOA restrictions, most rules are about preserving property value. The \u201ccues to care\u201d mean your HOA may accept your native yard \u2014 or you can join your HOA to ensure it changes its rules.\n\nHOAs are also losing their clout: a low-impact landscaping law passed in Maryland prevents homeowners associations from prohibiting environmentally friendly yards. Florida, Utah, Arizona, California and other states and cities have similar laws on the books or under consideration.\n\nGo native \u2014 but no need to fear all ornamentals. Native plants will give you the biggest ecological bang for your buck. Typically, they won\u2019t need water after they get established. Start by asking your native plant society or nursery. There\u2019s one in every state, or search for master gardener groups and extension services online in your area who can answer your questions (for free!).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding ornamentals to the mix can add appeal without losing much ecological value. \u201cThere\u2019s so much pressure to only go native,\u201d says Kiers. \u201cThat\u2019s silly.\u201d Just prioritize natives and avoid invasives.\n\nPlant keystone species, feed the food web. These plants support the most wildlife. White oaks and relatives, for example, are exemplary trees for wildlife in 84 percent of U.S. counties. But every region is different so find your ecoregion here, and Backyard National Parks lists the top plants for your area.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to leave areas under trees and shrubs with leaves, logs or small native seedlings. More than 90 percent of the caterpillars drop off their host plant and need ground cover to finish their life cycle.\n\nSpread seeds for an instant flower garden. Any clearing at the edge of a path, around a tree or even a sidewalk can become a thriving garden with a few seeds and some occasional watering. If you do buy potted plants, use small pots (1 gallon vs. 4 gallon), as the plants are more likely to thrive.\n\nDon\u2019t have a lawn? Plant a balcony or become a guerrilla gardener. Biodiversity can thrive on your balcony, terrace or rooftop. Find keystone plant species appropriate for container gardening (and tips) here for ecoregions across the United States and Canada. Containers are \u201crefueling pit stops\u201d for native pollinators, says Homegrown National Park. Large pots are best, and some perennial species will return year after year.\n\nAnd there are plenty of forgotten spaces where a wildflower garden can take root \u2014 you don\u2019t even need to own it. Throw a few \u201cseed bombs\u201d on bare ground, and after some initial watering, a native garden can bloom almost anywhere from a Brooklyn sidewalk to back alleys.\n\nExpress yourself. The natural world has a nearly infinite variety of species for you to grow into. After some trial and error, you may find yourself as more than a gardener, but the creator of your own tidy wilderness.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that we can fix our ecological problems by indulging rather than sacrificing,\u201d says Tallamy. \u201cIt has been very difficult to address environmental issues by asking people to give up something.\u201d"}

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight On Thursday the justices will hear oral arguments about a Colorado Supreme Court decision that found Trump engaged in insurrection before and during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and is, as a result, disqualified from running under the 14th Amendment. The provision was initially adopted to keep Confederates from returning to power.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have raised concerns about Thomas\u2019s ability to remain impartial in this and several other Jan. 6-related cases given the involvement of his wife, Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, in the movement to overturn the 2020 election results. The ballot disqualification case, which is likely to be decided quickly, is a test of the court\u2019s recently released code of conduct and recusal guidelines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhy might a justice recuse from a case?\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s newly adopted ethics code asks the justices to disqualify themselves if their \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned, that is, where an unbiased and reasonable person who is aware of all relevant circumstances would doubt that the Justice could fairly discharge his or her duties.\u201d\n\nThe code suggests recusal if a justice or their spouse has \u201can interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding\u201d or is \u201clikely to be a material witness in the proceeding.\u201d Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who previously served on Harvard University\u2019s Board of Overseers, notably recused herself from one of two cases examining the constitutionality of race-conscious admissions practices in 2022 because Harvard was the defendant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the decision to recuse is up to the individual justice \u2014 a point of contention among critics including Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who is sponsoring legislation to impose an enforceable ethics code on the justices.\n\nWhen they do sit out a case, justices do not have to say why; Justice Neil M. Gorsuch gave no reason when he recused himself this year from an Oklahoma death penalty case, although it was probably related to his time as a judge on an appeals court that covers Oklahoma.\n\nRecusals are rare at the high court, in part because unlike in lower courts, no other judge can fill in for an absent justice. When the Supreme Court is shorthanded, it can result in a 4-4 tie. Justices recused themselves in about 3 percent of appeals between 2018 and 2022, with Justices Samuel A. Alito and Elena Kagan doing so most often, according to a 2023 Bloomberg Law analysis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas didn\u2019t sit out any case between 2018 and 2021, but recused himself from 3 percent of cases in 2022, according to the analysis. When the high court accepted the Colorado case, there was no indication that Thomas would recuse from it.\n\nHow was Ginni Thomas involved in Jan. 6?\n\nGinni Thomas pressed the Trump White House and lawmakers to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory, exchanging more than two dozen text messages with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in the weeks after the vote.\n\nShe corresponded with lawyer John Eastman, a former Thomas clerk who had advocated a fringe legal theory that Vice President Mike Pence could block the certification of Biden\u2019s electoral college win.\n\nThomas also attended the Jan. 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally before the Capitol attack and told the House committee investigating the attack in 2022 that she still believed the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nArguments for Justice Thomas to hear the case\n\nMark Paoletta, the D.C. lawyer and former White House aide who helped with Thomas\u2019s confirmation, said Ginni Thomas is allowed to express her opinion on matters that come before the court, and \u201cthose opinions do not constitute an \u2018interest\u2019 that requires recusal.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs there is no basis whatsoever for Justice Thomas to recuse from Trump v. Anderson, Justice Thomas has a duty to sit on this case,\u201d Paoletta said in an email.\n\nRetired federal judge Jeremy Fogel said Thomas doesn\u2019t necessarily need to recuse if the Supreme Court plans to approach Thursday\u2019s case through the lens of whether Trump\u2019s ballot status should be up to Congress \u2014 instead of debating whether the Jan. 6 attack was an insurrection.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThat\u2019s because the justices will be asking technical, procedural questions about the very first court hearing on the matter in Denver. Fogel said the justices could ask questions such as, \u201cWhat is the power of the states [with] respect [to] this particular constitutional amendment?\u201d They could also ask \u201cWas the hearing conducted fairly?\u201d and \u201cWas it an adequate process of fact-finding?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor that reason, \u201cthe specific issues that [they\u2019d be] deciding in the insurrection case [would] not implicate the interests of [Thomas] or anyone to whom he\u2019s close,\u201d said Fogel, who is now the executive director of the Berkeley Judicial Institute.\n\nThomas could also argue that the ballot disqualification case, the outcome of which could change the landscape of the 2024 presidential election, requires input from all nine justices, said Gabe Roth, executive director of the transparency group Fix the Court.\n\nArguments for Thomas to recuse\n\nLast month, seven Democratic lawmakers led by Rep. Hank Johnson (Ga.), the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s courts subcommittee, sent a letter to Thomas urging him to recuse himself from the ballot disqualification case, citing dwindling public confidence in the Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFewer than half of all Americans trust the Supreme Court, and that number will fall even lower if you rule in this case,\u201d the eight Democrats warned. \u201cTo protect the Court\u2019s integrity and the legitimacy of its decision in this monumental case, you must recuse yourself.\u201d\n\nFogel said Thomas should also weigh how his decision to hear the case will affect the public\u2019s perception of the court and its eventual ruling.\n\nGinni Thomas\u2019s involvement \u201craises the question of whether he can fairly assess the gravity of the conduct that President Trump is accused of,\u201d Fogel said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not the precise issue that the court is deciding, it [may create] the appearance that he is going to try to find a way to rule in President Trump\u2019s favor because of his wife\u2019s affiliations and advocacy.\u201d\n\nWhen has Thomas recused from a case before?\n\nThomas has so far sat out one Jan. 6-related case: An appeal by Eastman related to his efforts to help Trump block certification of the 2020 election. Thomas didn\u2019t list a reason for his recusal, but it may be because Eastman is the justice\u2019s former law clerk and friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFogel called Thomas\u2019s decision to recuse himself from the Eastman case a \u201cno brainer.\u201d\n\nBut the court did not indicate when it took the Colorado ballot case that Thomas, or any justice, would sit out \u2014 which means it is almost certain that all will participate.\n\nThe result, according to Fogel: \u201cPeople who are already wary or critical are going to be more wary and more critical,\u201d he said.\n\nRoth said he hopes that Thomas will explain his reasoning for hearing the case.\n\n\u201cI think that he has that responsibility to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to participate in all these cases. There\u2019s all these questions swirling around. This is why I think that it\u2019s okay for me to do so,\u2019\u201d Roth said."}

During their discussion, DeWit said that important people did not want Lake to run for Senate and wondered if she would think about instead going on a corporate payroll. Lake told him that she would not \u201cbe bought\u201d and publicly cast the offer as evidence of bribery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLake has acknowledged that she made the recording.

Lake, who narrowly lost the 2022 gubernatorial race, is viewed as the front-runner in the Aug. 6 GOP primary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA campaign representative said that Lake is \u201cunifying Republican voters\u201d across the state for her Senate bid and that her standing improved after the DeWit recording was made public.\n\nBut interviews with Republican activists suggest the leaked tape has opened a new line of attack against her and has already diminished trust in her among some of her biggest supporters.\n\nLake\u2019s backers previously celebrated her approach of taping her critics and releasing recordings, especially when it meant trying to embarrass reporters or Democrats.\n\nThis time, however, the target was a fellow Republican with deep ties to grass-roots conservatives. As Arizona state treasurer, DeWit was among the earliest statewide elected officials to endorse Trump\u2019s 2016 bid for president and he went on to hold top positions in Trump\u2019s previous campaigns. Last year, the former president and Lake helped install DeWit as head of the state GOP for the 2024 elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeWit resigned after the recording became public, but it was Lake who felt much of the blowback.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust her \u2014 I am done,\u201d said Barbara Wyllie, 81, a lifelong Republican who shifted her support after release of the recording to Lake\u2019s GOP primary opponent, Mark Lamb, a county sheriff.\n\n\u201cWhen she did that to Jeff DeWit, it\u2019s like, \u2018Okay, she\u2019s wired for everybody,\u201d said Wyllie, who was in the audience when Lake took the stage and said she was surprised by the sustained booing that came from \u201call over the room.\u201d\n\nLake seemed taken aback by the crowd\u2019s response, attendees said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t agree on everything,\u201d she said to loud jeering, according to videos obtained by The Washington Post of the appearance, which was not open to the press. She pressed ahead, repeating a false claim: \u201cBut one thing we do agree on: The elections in Arizona are a corrupt mess.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe line typically pleases Republican crowds all around this desert state, which Trump won in 2016 before narrowly losing it in 2020. It did not quell the crowd.\n\nFollowing the 2020 election, Lake transformed nearly overnight from a local news anchor to a national conservative superstar by aggressively embracing Trump\u2019s false claims that the election was stolen from him.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nRepublican leaders and political consultants in the state say they still view Lake, who is endorsed by Trump, as their eventual Senate nominee. But some are skeptical that she can retake the seat, especially if Sinema decides to run.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that people in the party have character questions and authenticity questions about Kari Lake, this story plays into those questions,\u201d said Kirk Adams, a political and business consultant, former Arizona House speaker, and onetime chief of staff to former governor Doug Ducey (R).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe incident has not appeared to damage her standing with the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\n\u201cThe NRSC is not at all concerned about Kari Lake having trouble with the base,\u201d said a person familiar with the group\u2019s strategy. \u201cShe has some of the strongest base Teflon in the country.\u201d\n\nBut other national groups are still in wait-and-see mode about Arizona, where Republicans have performed dismally in recent cycles and where Lake has been a particularly divisive figure. The Senate Leadership Fund PAC, aligned with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has already reserved millions in advertising for the Senate race in Montana but has not invested in Arizona.\n\nJason Miller, a senior Trump adviser who also advises Lake\u2019s campaign, said in a statement that Trump, Lake and the new Arizona GOP chair, Gina Swoboda, are unified in their approach to winning Arizona.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats view Lake as a vulnerable candidate who is prone to controversy. They have largely avoided getting involved in the latest flare-up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of drama and, you know, Arizona needs none of that,\u201d the leading Democratic Senate candidate, Rep. Ruben Gallego, said during an appearance on a local TV show, \u201cPolitics Unplugged.\u201d\n\nIn the spring, before Lake entered the Senate race, prominent national and local Republicans expressed skepticism that she could win. She had just lost the 2022 gubernatorial election by about 17,000 votes, delivering a crucial pickup to the Democrats. Lake\u2019s GOP critics worried that her style of politics was too extreme for moderate Republicans and independent voters, whose support is key to winning a state that is no longer reliably red.\n\nDeWit searched for other potential candidates, even drawing up a list that included some of the biggest names in Arizona sports, said a person familiar with the efforts who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In early March, he drove to Lake\u2019s home for a private conversation to see if he could talk her out of running.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey sat across from each other in her living room as her small dog roamed, according to a person familiar with the encounter. Lake recorded the conversation, which is legal in Arizona, as a way to protect herself, a campaign representative said. In doing so, this person said, Lake \u201cexposed an unethical individual attempting to bribe her out of politics. It didn\u2019t work, she can\u2019t be bought.\u201d\n\nTen months later, ahead of a key state GOP gathering and Trump\u2019s first scheduled return to Arizona in more than a year, the London-based Daily Mail published audio of the conversation. Without naming names, DeWit told Lake that \u201cvery powerful people\u201d who were \u201cback east\u201d did not want her to run. He said that they were \u201cwilling to put their money where their mouth is in a big way.\u201d At one point, he asked, \u201cIs there a number at which \u2014\u201d before she interjected: \u201cI can be bought?\u201d\n\nWhen the audio went public, Lake presented the interaction as proof of a political system rife with corruption. DeWit resigned, saying that Lake\u2019s team had given him an ultimatum to leave his post or more audio would be released. Lake advisers have said that no such warning was issued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeWit said he was shocked to learn of the recording, calling it a \u201cbetrayal of trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe release of our conversation by Lake confirms a disturbing tendency to exploit private interactions for personal gain,\u201d he said.\n\nLake\u2019s campaign did not address the question when asked whether there were other recordings of her dealings with Republicans.\n\nAfter the 2022 midterm election, as it became clear that she would lose her bid for governor, a social media account associated with Lake\u2019s campaign posted a video from inside the GOP war room that captured a portion of a call between attorneys in the room and a Maricopa County lawyer.\n\nSome Republicans said they assumed they were taped by Lake because, as one described it, \u201cshe always had something on the back of her arm,\u201d which the person thought was part of an audio device.\n\nOne Arizona Republican who spoke to Lake on the phone last year before she entered the Senate race later learned that the conversation had been recorded, according to three people who were briefed about the contents of the call and the existence of a recording. Extensive portions of a conversation between Lake and 2022 Republican senatorial candidate Blake Masters, who considered running again for the Senate this year, were published in a Sept. 12 story by the Daily Beast. The story did not say that a recording had been made.\n\nA passage in Lake\u2019s memoir that recounted a meeting she had with Ducey after she won the 2022 GOP gubernatorial primary described the then-governor speaking few words. Ducey had been advised by aides before the meeting to presume that he was being recorded, said a person familiar with the discussion.\n\nThe controversy over the recordings has soured some GOP activists \u2014 but perhaps not enough to turn them against her candidacy.\n\nGary Morris, chair of the Gila County Republican Committee, said trust in Lake had diminished as a result of the incident.\n\n\u201cAnybody that\u2019s worked with her, and into the future, are going to wonder, \u2018Is she recording me?\u2019\u201d said Morris, who joined in on the booing of Lake as a way to register his misgivings. \u201cThose who were booing felt betrayed \u2014 that outside of politics or inside of politics, you just do not audiotape somebody for personal benefit.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Morris said, he still supports her."}

Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.\n\nThis week the Supreme Court considers its most consequential case involving a presidential election since Bush v. Gore in 2000. Officials in both Colorado and Maine have ruled that Donald Trump is ineligible for their ballots because he violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment \u2014 by engaging in insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. The Supreme Court will review the Colorado decision, with oral arguments set for Thursday. (Maine has effectively put its own case on hold as it awaits a ruling on Colorado.)\n\nSo what are the points of contention that will decide this issue? Let\u2019s look at the relevant parts of the 14th Amendment and break down what Trump has said about why those who would use the amendment to keep him off the ballot are wrong, what the Colorado courts have said, and what past cases say that may inform the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling.\n\nSection 3 No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States , or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States1 , or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States2 , shall have engaged in insurrection3 or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. Section 5 The Congress shall have power to enforce4 , by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. The, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\n\nThe burden in the case that the Supreme Court takes up this week appears to lie with those who would remove Trump from the ballot. Trump could avoid this outcome even if he succeeds on only one of the several relevant questions. From there, a big question is what the ruling would mean for the 2024 election."}

The Post sued for the documents and won.\n\nSoon after his country began bombing Yemen in 2015, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates confidentially reached out to an old friend: retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who also served as the deputy supreme commander of the Emirati military, needed help. The UAE was part of a coalition of Arab countries that had intervened in Yemen\u2019s civil war to fight Iran-backed Houthi rebels. But the coalition\u2019s bombing campaign was killing large numbers of civilians and doing little to deter the Houthis.\n\nWith the conflict threatening to turn into a regional quagmire, Mohamed asked Mattis, who retired from the Marines in 2013 after years of fighting wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, to work for him as a military adviser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn keeping with federal law, Mattis applied in June 2015 for permission from the Marines and the State Department to advise Mohamed and the UAE on \u201cthe operational, tactical, informational and ethical aspects\u201d of the war in Yemen, according to previously undisclosed documents obtained by The Washington Post through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit.\n\nHis request was highly unusual: a legendary four-star Marine asking to work for a foreign head of state as a personal consultant about an ongoing war.\n\nComplicating matters, the U.S. military had become entangled in the conflict. Soon after the bombing started, the Obama administration agreed to support the Arab coalition\u2019s air forces, led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, with aerial refueling and intelligence. But U.S. officials were growing alarmed by the number of innocent Yemenis dying in coalition airstrikes.\n\nNonetheless, U.S. officials swiftly approved Mattis\u2019s request. Then they fought to conceal his advisory role in the war in Yemen and his work for Mohamed. After The Post sued in 2021 for records of retired U.S. military personnel employed by foreign governments, federal agencies took 2\u00bd years to release the ones about Mattis.\n\nMattis did not publicly reveal his consulting job for the UAE when he returned to the Pentagon in January 2017 to become secretary of defense in the Trump administration. He omitted it from his public work history and financial disclosure forms that he filed with the Office of Government Ethics. Though he reported it confidentially to the Senate Armed Services Committee, multiple senators said they were not informed. He also did not mention it in his 2019 memoir.\n\nThroughout his career, Mattis, now 73, has praised the UAE as a valued ally to Washington. Between 2010 and 2013, when he was a Marine general in charge of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, he referred to the small Persian Gulf nation as \u201cLittle Sparta\u201d because of its outsized military prowess.\n\nBut Mattis, one of the most prominent American military leaders since 9/11, has maintained a steadfast public silence about his stint as a military adviser to the Emirates. He has never disclosed the exact scope or duration of his work. He declined multiple requests from The Post for an interview or to answer written questions about his duties for Mohamed.\n\nThere are conflicting accounts about whether he was paid for his foreign service. The documents obtained by The Post state that the UAE would compensate Mattis for his advice on the war in Yemen, as well as award him a $100,000 honorarium for giving one speech after he left the Trump administration. But a spokesman for the retired general said he worked for free.\n\nOver the past decade, it has become a common, if secretive, practice for retired U.S. military personnel to work as consultants and contractors for foreign governments. Hundreds of veterans have cashed in on their experience gained during two decades of war in the Middle East and Afghanistan by training foreign armies.\n\nA Post investigation in 2022 found that the oil-rich UAE, despite its small size, hired more U.S. veterans than any other country in the world, often for salaries that dwarfed what they earned while wearing American uniforms. Mattis\u2019s service to the UAE was cited in that investigation, which was based on the FOIA lawsuit filed by The Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe litigation compelled the armed forces and State Department to disclose records about retired U.S. military service members employed by foreign governments. Under an anti-corruption clause in the Constitution, retired U.S. military personnel must obtain federal approval before they can accept jobs, gifts or anything of value from foreign powers.\n\nAt the time, however, federal officials shielded many documents regarding Mattis, releasing only fragments of information about his unspecified role as a military adviser. They also redacted records regarding his compensation.\n\nThe Post continued to press its case in court, arguing that details of his work on behalf of a foreign power should be made public to shed light on whether it may have posed a conflict of interest when he returned to the U.S. government to run the Pentagon.\n\nIn response to a judge\u2019s order, federal agencies last fall released additional records which reveal for the first time that Mattis was personally hired by Mohamed to advise him on the war in Yemen, as well as other details about his ties to the UAE.\n\n\u2018I will be compensated\u2019\n\nThough Mattis has remained silent about his consulting, he has been long ebullient in public about his regard for the UAE.\n\nIn a video testimonial to mark the UAE\u2019s 50th birthday two years ago, Mattis fondly recalled first visiting the country as a junior Marine officer in 1979. He also reminisced about building a \u201ctrusting relationship over many years\u201d with Mohamed and praised the country\u2019s troops as \u201cequal brothers in arms who knew how to fight.\u201d\n\nLike Mattis, the 62-year-old Mohamed is a career military man. He is also one of the most influential figures in the Arab world. He ascended to the presidency of the UAE in 2022 after the death of his eldest brother, Sheikh Khalifa.\n\nHe and Mattis bonded in the aftermath of the Arab Spring in 2011 when Mattis was serving as head of U.S. Central Command, overseeing all U.S. forces in the Middle East. With revolutions spreading through the Arab world, the Emirati leadership became unnerved at the risk of further instability and embarked on a massive military buildup, buying billions of dollars in weaponry from the United States.\n\nAt the time, Mohamed was the crown prince of the city-state of Abu Dhabi, one of seven tribal monarchies that form the UAE, as well as deputy supreme commander of the country\u2019s military. He and Mattis shared an antipathy toward Iran, with both men regarding its theocratic rulers as the region\u2019s biggest security threat.\n\nIn March 2015, the UAE joined the Arab military coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, that interceded in the Yemeni civil war. But the coalition\u2019s bombing campaign and naval blockade caused widespread humanitarian suffering and failed to subdue the Houthis, who had seized control of the capital, Sanaa.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Mohamed contacted Mattis, who had since retired from the U.S. military, to ask if he would work for the UAE as a consultant. In his federal application for foreign government employment, Mattis said he would advise Mohamed regarding the war in Yemen, but he did not elaborate how much time he would devote to the job or how deeply he would become involved in the conflict.\n\n\u201cMy duties would include reviewing the UAE\u2019s military situation, focused initially on the Yemen campaign, with the purpose of providing military advice,\u201d he wrote in June 2015. \u201cThe purpose of this position is to bring American military experience in warfighting and campaigning to bear in terms of strengthening UAE\u2019s efforts.\u201d\n\nMattis made clear that he would be paid.\n\n\u201cI will be compensated,\u201d he wrote by hand, in block letters, on a Foreign Government Employment Questionnaire that he submitted to the Marine Corps on June 4, 2015, as part of his application to work for the UAE.\n\nOn the questionnaire, Mattis said he still needed to negotiate details of his pay package with UAE officials. \u201cThe amount is to be determined after I have been cleared by the U.S. government to respond positively\u201d to Mohamed\u2019s offer to hire him, he wrote.\n\nBut Robert Tyrer, co-president of the Cohen Group, a Washington consulting firm where Mattis is a senior counselor, told The Post in a series of emails that the UAE did not pay Mattis for his work. He added that, other than travel expenses, Mattis had \u201ca longstanding policy\u201d of not accepting money from foreign officials.\n\n\u201cHe has never requested nor received any compensation from any foreign government at any time,\u201d Tyrer said.\n\nAsked to explain the discrepancy with what Mattis wrote on his application, Tyrer said the retired general never actually expected to be paid, but stated on his form that he would be \u2014 only because he wanted his application to receive extra scrutiny to ensure everything was aboveboard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGeneral Mattis sought the most rigorous level of review for this request,\u201d Tyrer said. \u201cThat higher level of review was triggered by describing the role as a compensated position, though General Mattis neither requested nor received any compensation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the documents obtained by The Post, however, there is no indication that Mattis\u2019s application was subjected to a higher or more stringent review than normal.\n\nIn fact, a Marine special security officer completed a required counterintelligence review just five days after Mattis submitted his application \u2014 a process that typically takes weeks. \u201cIt is my opinion that Gen Mattis be approved,\u201d the officer wrote on June 9, 2015. A Marine Corps attorney finished a mandatory legal review seven days later, also raising no objection.\n\nMattis\u2019s application sailed through the remainder of the Marines\u2019 chain of command, receiving preliminary approval on June 19 \u2014 15 days after he submitted it. Then the Corps passed the paperwork to the State Department, where the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs gave final approval on Aug. 5.\n\nAltogether, the national security bureaucracy took only two months to clear Mattis to work for a foreign head of state.\n\nIn comparison, the armed forces and State Department usually take several months, and sometimes years, to review veterans\u2019 foreign-government employment applications, according to a Post analysis of hundreds of such cases since 2015.\n\nDiplomats in the dark\n\nA handful of federal officials who regulate foreign-government employment knew that Mattis was advising Mohamed on the war in Yemen. But other national security officials said they did not \u2014 including diplomats in charge of U.S. policy in the Middle East.\n\nAnne Patterson, a career diplomat who worked with Mattis when he was a Marine general, oversaw U.S. foreign policy in the Arab world in 2015 as the State Department\u2019s assistant secretary for Near East Affairs. In a phone interview, she said she vaguely remembered that the department\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs informed her about Mattis\u2019s application to consult for the UAE and that she gave her assent.\n\nBut Patterson, who retired from the U.S. government in 2017, added that neither she nor her leadership team was aware that Mattis wanted to advise the Emiratis on the war in Yemen, which had become a major foreign policy headache for the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cNone of us remember General Mattis having anything to do with Yemen during that period,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Yemen thing, we just have no recollection of his involvement with it in any respect.\u201d\n\nGerald Feierstein, who was the deputy assistant secretary for Near East Affairs under Patterson, said he was also in the dark. Like Patterson, Feierstein had gotten to know Mattis personally during the general\u2019s tenure as the commander of U.S. military forces in the Middle East between 2010 and 2013, when Feierstein served as the U.S. ambassador to Yemen.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is very curious,\u201d said Feierstein, who retired from the State Department in May 2016. \u201cI find it kind of hard to believe he would never have mentioned it to any of us.\u201d\n\nBeyond the laws regulating foreign-government employment, Feierstein said it was considered a professional courtesy for retired senior U.S. military officers to brief the State Department about their interactions with foreign leaders.\n\n\u201cMattis as you know is a pretty straight shooter, so I would have thought he would have briefed somebody,\u201d he said.\n\nYousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, did not respond to an email seeking comment about Mattis\u2019s employment as a military adviser.\n\nTrump\u2019s pick to run the Pentagon\n\nEighteen months after he applied for federal permission to work for the UAE, Mattis received another job offer: to serve in the administration of President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nTrump didn\u2019t know Mattis well but was impressed by his reputation as a blunt, no-nonsense general and approved of his hard-line views toward Iran. In December 2016, he nominated Mattis to become secretary of defense.\n\nLike other prospective senior U.S. officials, Mattis was obliged to report information about his work history and personal finances to the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nIn the first section of his financial-disclosure report, Mattis was required by law to include all jobs and positions \u2014 including uncompensated ones \u2014 held outside the U.S. government during the previous two calendar years.\n\nOn his form, he listed 11 affiliations, including his jobs as a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution (salary: $419,359) and his memberships on the corporate boards of General Dynamics ($242,000 in director\u2019s fees, plus stock options) and Theranos Inc., ($150,000 in director\u2019s fees, plus 416,667 shares of common stock).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also listed his unpaid board seats with the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation and the Tri-Cities Food Bank in Kennewick, Wash.\n\nBut he did not include his consulting job with Mohamed. Nor did he list it on a separate letter, dated Jan. 5, 2017, to the Pentagon\u2019s top ethics official. In that document, he described all the steps he would take \u201cto avoid any actual or apparent conflicts of interest\u201d as defense secretary by resigning all his outside affiliations and refraining from any matter, for at least one year, involving any of the organizations that employed him.\n\nMattis\u2019s UAE service was also not made public by the Senate Armed Services Committee, which had to approve his nomination before he could take charge at the Pentagon. His advisory work for Mohamed is not included in his answers to a nine-page biographical questionnaire that the committee posted on its website. Nor did he raise it or anyone ask about it during his confirmation hearing on Jan. 12, 2017.\n\nIn a statement, Cole Stevens, a committee spokesperson who works for Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the panel chairman, said Mattis disclosed his consulting for the UAE on \u201cthe confidential portion of his questionnaire,\u201d which the committee \u201cconsiders private.\" He also said that Mattis stated he was not compensated for his work. .\n\nThe committee tightly restricts access to the confidential portions of the questionnaires for presidential nominees. Stevens said the information \u201cis available\u201d to all members of the committee. But senators typically must request private briefings to receive it, according to a current and a former Senate staff member familiar with the panel\u2019s work.\n\nThe Post contacted the offices of 25 senators who served on the Armed Services Committee in January 2017 to ask if they were aware at the time of Mattis\u2019s work for the UAE. Only Reed and two other senators responded. A spokesperson for Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said he \u201cwas not aware of this and was surprised to hear it.\u201d In a statement, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) likewise said he \u201cwas not informed during the confirmation process that Secretary Mattis had served as a military advisor to the UAE\u201d and that \u201cI have long had reservations\u201d about retired senior U.S. officers \u201cserving as military advisors for foreign states.\u201d\n\nLast year, Congress approved legislation that will require the Pentagon and State Department for the first time to publicly release an annual report listing retired military personnel who work for foreign governments, including their compensation and a description of their duties. President Biden signed the measure into law in December.\n\nA friend in Abu Dhabi\n\nAs he took charge in the Pentagon, Mattis maintained his close relationship with the United Arab Emirates.\n\nOn Feb. 18, 2017, one month after the Senate voted 98-1 to confirm him as defense secretary, Mattis flew to Abu Dhabi as part of an official trip to the Middle East. Upon his arrival, he was warmly received by Mohamed.\n\nAccording to a public statement issued by the Defense Department about the meeting, the two leaders discussed security challenges on the Arabian Peninsula, \u201cincluding the ongoing instability in Yemen.\u201d\n\nThere was no mention in the statement that Mattis had been working as a private consultant for Mohamed on that very problem.\n\nWithin a tight circle of retired four-star generals in Washington, however, word spread about Mattis\u2019s employment by Mohamed.\n\nIn June 2017, retired Marine Gen. John Allen, a former commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan who had served with Mattis, received inquiries to work as a national-security consultant for the government of Qatar, another wealthy Persian Gulf country.\n\nAt the time, Allen already had a full-time job as the president of the Brookings Institution, a prominent Washington think tank. But he was intrigued by the possibility of moonlighting for the Qataris. He knew Mattis had done something similar with the UAE and wanted to compare notes, according to documents disclosed in federal court last year as part of a Justice Department investigation into foreign influence peddling in Washington.\n\nOn June 9, 2017, Allen contacted a senior adviser on Mattis\u2019s staff at the Pentagon. He asked to learn more about Mattis\u2019s consulting for Mohamed, who is widely known in Washington by his initials, MBZ.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m being offered a consulting contract akin to the one Jim had with MBZ and wanted your advice on how it was structured,\u201d Allen emailed Mattis\u2019s adviser, whose name was redacted in the court documents. \u201cYour sense on how Jim created and maintained his relationship with MBZ would be helpful.\u201d They agreed to meet the next afternoon for a cup of tea at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Pentagon City.\n\nAllen declined to comment for this story through a spokesman\n\nThe email exchange was included as an exhibit in a court filing last year in the federal prosecution of Richard G. Olson Jr., a former U.S. ambassador to the UAE. Olson pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors related to his post-retirement consulting work in the Middle East, including a charge that he illegally lobbied U.S. officials on behalf of the government of Qatar.\n\nThe FBI scrutinized Allen for his contacts with Qatari officials as part of the same investigation, but the Justice Department closed the case without charging him. Allen\u2019s attorney has said he did not end up consulting for Qatar, did nothing improper and received no fees from the Qatari government.\n\nThat case is one of several criminal investigations that the Justice Department has opened in recent years into prominent U.S. national security figures for allegedly falling under the influence of foreign governments.\n\nA pending federal indictment against Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) accuses the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of taking bribes and acting as an illegal foreign agent on behalf of Egypt and Qatar. Menendez has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.\n\nIn December, a retired U.S. ambassador, Manuel Rocha, was charged with acting for decades as a \u201cclandestine agent\u201d on behalf of Cuban intelligence, among other crimes. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn 2020, shortly before leaving the White House, President Donald Trump pardoned his former national security adviser, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, for his conviction of lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States.\n\nIn 2022, U.S. intelligence officials authored a classified report cataloguing attempts by the UAE to manipulate U.S. foreign policy and politics in Washington to the benefit of the Gulf nation. The classified report from the National Intelligence Council detailed the UAE\u2019s use of lobbying firms and campaign contributions, as well as illegal influence operations, in an effort to distort the American democratic system.\n\n\u2018$100K plus Airfare & Lodging\u2019\n\nThe war in Yemen continued to deteriorate during Mattis\u2019s tenure as defense secretary.\n\nIn June 2017, human rights groups accused the UAE armed forces of operating a secret network of prisons inside Yemen where local men were beaten, flogged and sexually assaulted. The Associated Press reported that some prisoners were shackled to a \u201cgrill\u201d and roasted alive over open flames. (The UAE government denied the allegations).\n\nTwo months later, CNN published an article online reporting that Mattis had once served as an adviser to the UAE \u2014 the first public reference to his foreign employment. The CNN report was based on a single line in a spreadsheet that the Marine Corps had released to a nonprofit watchdog group, the Project on Government Oversight (POGO).\n\nPOGO had filed a public-records request for a list of retired Marine generals authorized to work for foreign governments. Mattis was one of seven retired generals on the list. The heavily redacted spreadsheet revealed that he had applied to work as a military adviser to the UAE in 2015 but gave no other information.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman told CNN that Mattis advised the UAE on \u201crebuilding its military\u201d and that he worked for free, with reimbursement only for travel expenses.\n\nBy August 2018, United Nations human rights officials reported that nearly 17,000 civilians had been killed or wounded, most of them in airstrikes launched by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other members of the Arab coalition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat same month, Mattis warned that the United States might withhold its support to the coalition, including weapons sales and shared intelligence, if it didn\u2019t do a better job of protecting noncombatants.\n\nIn December 2018, Mattis resigned as defense secretary after clashing with Trump over the president\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and halve the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nThree months later, upon returning to the private sector, Mattis once again applied for federal approval to accept employment from the Emirati government, this time as a featured speaker at a conference on U.S.-UAE relations hosted by Mohamed in Abu Dhabi.\n\nIn his application, Mattis said the UAE would pay him an \u201chonorarium\u201d and cover his travel expenses, according to documents obtained by The Post as part of its FOIA lawsuit.\n\nAt first, the Marine Corps redacted details of the financial arrangements, saying that disclosure would violate Mattis\u2019s privacy. After The Post argued that the information should be made public, a federal judge ordered the Corps to disclose it. The Marines eventually complied \u2014 three years after The Post first requested the records.\n\nIn response to a question about whether he would be paid for his speech in Abu Dhabi, Mattis\u2019s unredacted application shows that he wrote: \u201cYes, standard honorarium for all presenters of this lecture series is $100K plus Airfare & Lodging Reimbursement.\u201d\n\nTyrer, the spokesman for Mattis, said he was not compensated for the speech in the end. He said Mattis only \u201clisted the standard honoraria figure that is commonly offered to participants\u201d so his application would receive a \u201crigorous\u201d review.\n\nThe conference was held in May 2019 at Al Bateen Palace, a royal residence in Abu Dhabi. In his remarks, Mattis said he turned down \u201c99 percent\u201d of his invitations for speaking engagements but made an exception for the UAE and Mohamed because of their close relationship with the United States.\n\n\u201cIt is broad enough, it is deep enough and it\u2019s strong enough to withstand any temporary challenges of any sort, because the underpinnings are just that strong,\u201d Mattis said, according to a videotaped portion of his speech posted online by the UAE Embassy in Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, the war in Yemen is still raging. The UAE, the United States and its allies have been unable to defeat the Houthi rebels, who are stronger than ever, thanks to support from Iran.\n\nOn Jan. 3, the United States and 11 other nations issued a public ultimatum, warning the Houthis to stop firing missiles at merchant ships off the coast of Yemen in the Red Sea, or else the rebels would have to bear \u201cthe consequences.\u201d\n\nSince then, the attacks from the Houthis have only escalated, prompting the United States and Britain to hit back with military strikes from warships and aircraft in the region."}

But if you missed your chance and now need to raise a problem, it\u2019s not too late to establish some goodwill in the process.\n\nFirst, make sure you\u2019re calm. \u201cYou definitely want to breathe, and just kind of catch yourself because you can be so angry that it can come off as rude,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cYou want to be friendly with them and open with them, and introduce yourself.\u201d She suggests starting out with something casual, like \u201cIt sounds like you all had a real good time last night.\u201d\n\nGetting to know your neighbors might also change your perspective on their situation. If a family recently brought home a baby or adopted a rescue dog, for instance, you may feel more empathetic toward them. Ask questions to get a better sense of what\u2019s going on. If they\u2019re remodeling, ask how long it\u2019s expected to take. Perhaps you can accept some disruption if there\u2019s an end in sight. Or, if the offending noise is coming from an ordinary activity, such as mowing the lawn or practicing a musical instrument, maybe you can compromise on a less disruptive time for your neighbor to do it.\n\nEither way, how you communicate can make a difference. Psychologists sometimes define assertive communication as direct and honest, but respectful. Your body language might include eye contact, a straight posture and relaxed gestures. And keep the conversation focused on the issue at hand.\n\n\u201cAttack the issue, not the neighbor,\u201d says Michael Wood-Lewis, the co-founder and CEO of Front Porch Forum, an online platform for helping neighbors connect in Vermont.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWhat you should not do, Wood-Lewis says, is take to Facebook or Nextdoor, or a forum like the one he runs, to complain about an individual and turn others against them. \u201cMany of our big tech social platforms are specifically designed to increase engagement, and nothing increases engagement like people fighting with each other,\u201d he says. \u201cSo they\u2019re designed not for peaceful outcomes, but quite the opposite.\u201d\n\nAnd if at first you don\u2019t succeed, try and try again. If the noise continues after your first conversation, Wilson recommends talking to your neighbor again \u2026 and one more time after that. Basically, you\u2019re giving them every opportunity to solve the problem before involving a third party."}

AI.", "domain": "washingtonpost.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMI7UlAowt9F0", "text": "Jim Albrecht was senior director of news ecosystem products at Google from 2017 to 2023. The news publishing industry has always reviled new technology, whether it was radio or television, the internet or, now, generative artificial intelligence. After all, newspapers long had a monopoly on the distribution of information, and each innovation pared back the exclusiveness of that franchise.\n\nThe news industry\u2019s problem has also been my problem. For the past seven years, I ran a team at Google focused on making the web ecosystem more hospitable to news publishers. We built products to make the production of expensive journalism cheaper (giving them cutting-edge AI document analysis and transcription tools), to make it easier for people to buy subscriptions, and to let publishers showcase their editorial viewpoints and thus find their audiences more effectively. In aggregate, these things delivered billions of dollars of value to publishers around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut they did not fundamentally alter the fact that the internet had hollowed out the value of the daily newspaper. Back in the day, if you wanted to know a sports score, a stock quote, a movie showtime, where the garage sales were or what concerts were coming up, you looked in the newspaper. Now, the web allows you to find this information more quickly elsewhere. So, if consumers once had 20 reasons to buy a newspaper, now they had only one: news \u2014 the labor-intensive, expensive work of reporting and writing the news \u2014 which isn\u2019t a thing advertisers are especially excited to be associated with.\n\nTo combat this turn of affairs, news publishers, first in Europe but increasingly around the world, began turning to regulators and legislators to restore their past dominance \u2014 or at least their profitability. And I had to figure out how Google would respond to these demands.\n\nThe publishers\u2019 complaints were premised on the idea that web platforms such as Google and Facebook were stealing from them by posting \u2014 or even allowing publishers to post \u2014 headlines and blurbs linking to their stories. This was always a silly complaint because of a universal truism of the internet: Everybody wants traffic! Just look at the time and money publishers spend putting their links and content on those platforms \u2014 paying search-engine optimization companies and social media managers to get more links higher on the page. We found ourselves in the disorienting situation of having one team from a publisher charge, \u201cYou are stealing from us by placing our results on your site,\u201d while another team complained, \u201cIt\u2019s critically important to us that you place our results on your site more often and at higher levels of prominence!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not to say that news publishers had no legitimate complaints: Until 2017, Google would rarely link to stories behind a paywall, which was crippling to the subscription model that web publishers were coming to rely on. The selection of news results was imperfect, sometimes placing a site that had done painstaking original reporting below a less authoritative site that had done a quick rewrite of that scoop; and many readers were only interested in scanning the headlines and didn\u2019t click to read the actual story. Google fixed the first of these, made steady progress against the second and is powerless to solve the third \u2014 a battle that cover designers and front-page editors had been fighting for decades before the web.\n\nIn any event, regulators pursued the illegitimate complaint: the idea that platforms should pay publishers every time they display a headline/blurb or sometimes even for the act of linking itself. As these regulations or threats of regulation spread around the world \u2014 Europe, Australia, Indonesia, Brazil, Canada \u2014 I spent more and more time preparing to disable news products, or disabling search, or building accounting systems to count \u201csnippets\u201d and calculate payments. That meant I spent less time giving journalists research and transcription tools, or building mechanisms to help retain subscribers.\n\nAs for Facebook, each year, its traffic to news publishers plummeted. It is a well-known economic fact that when you take a thing with an established market price and impose a fixed price level above that, demand goes down. Prior to these laws, no one ever asked permission to link to a website or paid to do so. Quite the contrary, if anyone got paid, it was the party doing the linking. Why? Because everybody wants traffic! After all, this is why advertising businesses \u2014 publishers and platforms alike \u2014 can exist in the first place. They offer distribution to advertisers, and the advertisers pay them because distribution is valuable and seldom free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this sideshow was going on, we would hear how much closer large language models (LLMs) had gotten to reproducing human-level composition. Then LLM-based features began to show up in multiple products \u2014 grammar checking, autocomplete, etc. \u2014 and actually worked. To me, watching publishers bicker about payment for search results while LLMs advanced at a silent, frenetic pace was like watching people squabble about the floral arrangements at an outdoor wedding while the largest storm cloud you can imagine moves silently closer.\n\nAnd then, like a thunderclap, ChatGPT launched and put everything in stark relief. The problem has never been that platforms post links to news articles \u2014 that\u2019s what they should do. The problem is that new technology has created a landscape where they might not need to link to news sites at all \u2014 they can just take the news, have a robot rewrite it and publish it in their own products.\n\nAnd, for me, the world turned suddenly upside down. The absurd demand of news publishers \u2014 \u201csend me traffic and then pay me for having done so!\u201d \u2014 would soon be eclipsed by an equally absurd proposition from the tech industry: \u201cHow about we build a product on your content and send you little or no traffic in return?\u201d In the long run, neither of these irrationalities can stand. They\u2019ll either wither away because of their own economic absurdity or end up in the crosshairs of courts, legislators or regulators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut having seen firsthand the feckless way in which regulators lined up behind the first of those propositions, I\u2019m bracing myself for how they\u2019ll handle the second. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. On one side of the conflict sits existential risk for the publishing industry; on the other, existential risk for technological innovation.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nFirst come the courts. The New York Times fired the opening salvo in December in a suit charging OpenAI and Microsoft with violation of its copyright, starting with the use of its documents in training OpenAI\u2019s LLMs.\n\nIt seems quite plausible that the tech companies will win this first round. AI products transform text into geometric relationships that are fundamentally different from the news stories they came from, and these mathematical \u201cvectors\u201d cannot be substituted for those original stories. In other words, LLMs seem to pass the tests for fair use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly when you put an LLM into a consumer product such as a chatbot or search engine do you see it potentially infringing on copyright. An LLM, after all, can produce variations on any text. But even then, while those variations very clearly can substitute for the originals on which the model was trained, they are indeed variations \u2014 akin to the sort of human rewrites that publishing companies do all the time. (Note that the Times\u2019s recent suit presents evidence of ChatGPT reciting paragraphs of text from Times content \u2014 clearly a copyright violation \u2014 but this can be easily fixed, just as human rewriters can be trained not to repeat text verbatim from other sources.) Moreover, no one can own a copyright to mere facts. And yet, if one cannot, then how can the rights of content producers be protected?\n\nThe answer, I think, lies in the fact that LLMs tend to hallucinate \u2014 make up things that aren\u2019t real \u2014 and that they are so expensive to train that the models are updated on the order of months, rather than days or minutes. As the Times points out in its suit, generative AI products tend to rely on a process known as \u201cgrounding,\u201d in which the statements made by the AI are checked against relevant source documents to ensure that the AI is not making things up. This process is especially critical if a user is asking about a recent event in which the relevant facts did not exist at the time of the LLM\u2019s training. In such cases, the AI can only answer accurately if it retrieves those facts from recent grounding documents. These documents are the essence of the work newspapers do \u2014 sourcing and reporting new facts \u2014 and the fruits of that labor should reasonably belong to those who perform it.\n\nThe courts might or might not find this distinction between training and grounding compelling. If they don\u2019t, Congress must step in. By legislating copyright protection for content used by AI for grounding purposes, Congress has an opportunity to create a copyright framework that achieves many competing social goals. It would permit continued innovation in artificial intelligence via the training and testing of LLMs; it would require licensing of content that AI applications use to verify their statements or look up new facts; and those licensing payments would financially sustain and incentivize the news media\u2019s most important work \u2014 the discovery and verification of new information \u2014 rather than forcing the tech industry to make blanket payments for rewrites of what is already long known.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch legislation would provide publishers new opportunities to generate revenue. If LLM training is indeed held to be a fair use but grounding is not, the publishers\u2019 ability to verify the information or infuse it with up-to-date facts becomes not merely valuable but potentially differentiating for their own products. A small, local media company would be able to license its local articles and factual information to generative AI services, but a large media company might choose not to. It might rather offer its subscribers a differentiated AI service of its own, perhaps based on OpenAI or Google APIs, but enriched with proprietary information not available to other providers. Such a service might be more timely, comprehensive and relevant to its subscribers than the tech vendors\u2019 own products, and would enable publishers to extend their services back into categories of information they haven\u2019t effectively competed in since the print era.\n\nIf a court decision or congressional legislation were to rewrite the rules as described, what would the new media world look like? First, to take advantage of the new framework, media companies would need to understand that consumer expectations are about to change dramatically.\n\nIn the print era, publishers created \u201carticles,\u201d printed them on paper and distributed that paper to their readers. The web changed everything about the distribution and the literal paper, while the articles remained mostly untouched. But in the future, publishers will have to think less about those articles and more about conversations with users. The users will interact less and less with the actual articles and instead talk about the articles with what the tech industry used to call \u201cintelligent agents.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in the 1990s, Microsoft introduced Clippy \u2014 a simpering, eye-batting paper clip who interrupted you at inopportune moments to ask you whether you needed help. Microsoft put Clippy out of his misery long ago, but as is so often the case, the technology finally caught up to the idea.\n\nThe new breed of LLM-powered Clippy is going to do all the things Microsoft hoped it would in 1996: brief you on the news, your day, your emails; respond for you; answer your questions; help with your work. One morning, it might let you know that \u201cThe Washington Post announced it has launched a new AI assistant, called Marty.\u201d As you ask for more info, it says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just ask him to join us right now since you\u2019re a subscriber.\u201d Marty joins the conversation and gives you a roundup of The Post\u2019s latest coverage, responds to a question you have with a relevant info graphic, updates you on some political gossip and recommends a newly reviewed TV series based on your interests. (Because you\u2019re a subscriber, he knows what you like.) \u201cCan you find me a restaurant for Thursday night?\u201d you ask, and Marty gives you some of the best local options and what they\u2019re known for, and he notes that he can offer you a discount at one of them. Maybe you decide to make Marty a part of your daily briefing or, on the other hand, maybe you turn to your ChatGPT agent and ask, \u201cSo what do I need you for?\u201d She might say, \u201cI can do things like make travel arrangements,\u201d to which Marty responds, \u201cWe have a travel agent we work with, as well. Shall I ask ExpediaBot to join?\u201d Welcome to your new daily newspaper."}

There were plenty of illuminating and interesting things learned about the Washington Commanders\u2019 new coach during his introductory news conference Monday afternoon, such as that he wants his defense here to resemble his top-five unit with Dallas. That he calls Stacey, his wife of almost 30 years, his \u201cride or die.\u201d And that he really likes to swear.\n\nQuinn telegraphed his first PG-13 word soon into his nearly 50-minute question-and-answer session with reporters. The next several just flowed through his responses, like \u201ckick a--\u201d and \u201ccompetitive a--\u201d and \u201cwork our a--es off.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s one curse word that Quinn won\u2019t say: rebuild.\n\nOr, for the purposes of keeping this family friendly: \u201cr-----.\u201d\n\nYou want to make NFL coaches blush in embarrassment, start dropping that seven-letter word. They might make you throw money into the swear jar and then wash your mouth out with soap. It\u2019s the most censored word in NFL circles, at least publicly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cR-----\u201d is so dirty and so dishonorable that only mature audiences can handle it. Coaches, wanting to protect the innocent ears of their fan bases and especially their locker rooms, will use any word but that one. Even when the truth is, the Commanders under Quinn will be rebuilding. Oops. Pardon my French. I mean, they will be recalibrating.\n\nThis revelation came up innocently enough when an apparently foul-mouthed reporter asked Quinn for his timeline in turning around the Commanders and used the \u201cR\u201d word. To his credit, Quinn didn\u2019t instinctively raise both hands to the sides of his head and scream, \u201cEarmuffs, kids!\u201d He did, however, politely correct the counterfeit cuss word into something a bit more palatable.\n\n\u201cYour words, not mine,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI\u2019m really, honestly glad you brought it up. I know it\u2019s a big topic. I would say this is a recalibrate. Finding our north again. And that starts with our identity of our club. So, [you] will not hear me say the word \u2018rebuild\u2019 at all. This is about accessing what we have, how do we add to that and how quickly we can accelerate this process together.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWashington\u2019s new general manager, Adam Peters, has to draft a quarterback, someone who can potentially become the franchise guy. The offense will look different for the third time in three seasons because Quinn hired Kliff Kingsbury as the offensive coordinator. The defense will be overhauled under Joe Whitt Jr.\n\nSo much new is happening all at once. For the change to take effect, it will need time. And at the risk of sounding crude, the franchise appears to be entering a complete teardown, with a willingness to start everything over. A classic redo. In a word, a rebuild.\n\nHowever, in the NFL, you can\u2019t say that word. Veterans cringe at the prospect. While seven-year pro Jonathan Allen has since expressed excitement over the arrival of Quinn and Peters, as he played in the final weeks of the Ron Rivera era, he rejected the thought of starting over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI do want to win,\u201d Allen told the Junkies on 106.7 the Fan in December. \u201c \u2026 I\u2019m not in the business of going through another rebuild.\u201d\n\nWhile players in their prime have little time to waste, fan bases can be just as impatient when waiting on their teams to show improvement. Why stay calm watching your team flail through a rebuild when other teams have revved up the standings in warp speed? In every season but two over the past 21 years, at least one franchise has gone from worst to first in its division. The Houston Texans \u2014 recently a doormat in the weak AFC South \u2014 became the latest team to do so. Houston won three games a year ago, but after hiring DeMeco Ryans as coach and drafting a franchise-shifting quarterback in C.J. Stroud, the team leapfrogged its division rivals and even won a playoff game.\n\nThe woebegone Cincinnati Bengals can rise up as Super Bowl contenders in Zac Taylor\u2019s third season as coach (when Joe Burrow\u2019s healthy, at least), and the Detroit Lions can go from being a perpetual punchline to playing in the NFC championship game in Dan Campbell\u2019s third year. That\u2019s fun for football fans. Rebuilding is not. And Quinn gets it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReality strikes, however, when reading through the Commanders\u2019 long to-do list. Quinn has a vision of creating a physical and explosive team on defense, offense and special teams \u2014 \u201cI hope teams that will have to play against us are like: \u2018Damn! This is going to be hard today,\u2019\u201d he said \u2014 but developing that standard could take time.\n\nAs fired up as Quinn seems to be over his inherited defense, he\u2019s still getting a unit that collapsed near the end, surrendering 30 points or more five times over the final seven games of the season. Allen and Daron Payne anchor the interior, but every position group from the front four all the way to that leaky secondary could use a \u2014 what\u2019s the word again? \u2014 recalibration.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the defense. Quinn will have his hands full. But these are the hefty responsibilities Quinn has wanted since being fired by the Atlanta Falcons five games into the 2020 season. While building back the Cowboys\u2019 defense, the 53-year-old hoped for another shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI so wanted this moment,\u201d he said.\n\nThough Quinn might have waited patiently, he didn\u2019t express that same sentiment for the Commanders\u2019 reload, reconstruction, reshuffle, recarpeting, whatever they want to call it here.\n\n\u201cThere is no timeline on that, but we will push it hard to see how good we can get and how fast we can get it [there]. But I see it much more as a recalibration. Okay, let\u2019s find our north, form our identity and how we\u2019re going to get it on and then push hard to reach that,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cAnd like all things, it takes trust between teammates, staff, personnel, ownership, but the more connection we have, the faster we\u2019ll get there.\u201d"}

He could be ornery, cantankerous, self-deprecating and sensitive, recording mournful ballads about heartbreak and desire, as well as party songs about raising hell, drinking whiskey from a paper cup and getting high with his friend Willie Nelson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis biggest crossover hit, \u201cRed Solo Cup\u201d (2011), was an endearingly goofy ode to the humble plastic drinking vessel \u2014 \u201cthe best receptacle for barbecues, tailgates, fairs and festivals\u201d \u2014 which was sung in a quasi-drunken mumble and reached No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nMr. Keith also saluted the flag and the troops in hits like \u201cCourtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American\u201d) (2002), a post-9/11 morale raiser that generated controversy over its jingoistic lyrics, and \u201cMade in America\u201d (2011), a celebration of buying American-made goods and raising your children on \u201cKing James and Uncle Sam.\u201d\n\nThat combination of flag-waving patriotism and beer-soaked good humor helped make him one of country music\u2019s biggest stars, with 42 Top 10 hits on the genre\u2019s Billboard chart, including 20 No. 1s. By the late 2000s, he was bringing in nearly $50 million a year, aided by business ventures that included a restaurant chain, a liquor brand, a Nashville record label and a stake in Big Machine Records, the label that signed Taylor Swift.\n\n\u201cKeith\u2019s commercial chops, overlaying a wide patriotic appeal, have created the most vertically integrated performer in the music business \u2014 and a one-man cash machine,\u201d Forbes magazine declared in a 2013 cover story, which estimated his career earnings at more than half a billion dollars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was astonishing success for a singer who had gone from high school to the Oklahoma oil fields, and who proudly referred to himself as \u201coil field trash.\u201d Instead of college, he attended \u201cHonkytonk U,\u201d as he put it in a 2005 single, performing 51 weeks a year at beer joints, rodeos, basketball arenas and dance halls from Arizona to Arkansas.\n\nAfter about a decade of touring, Mr. Keith released his first single, \u201cShould\u2019ve Been a Cowboy,\u201d in 1993. The song topped the country chart and became the genre\u2019s most-played track of the decade, with lyrics that referenced the TV show \u201cGunsmoke\u201d and an earlier generation of country singers, romanticizing a life of roping, riding and \u201cstealing the young girls\u2019 hearts, just like Gene and Roy.\u201d\n\nMr. Keith went on to show a sly sense of humor in songs like \u201cI\u2019m Just Talkin\u2019 About Tonight\u201d (2001), which celebrated a one-night stand and became a honky-tonk standard, and \u201cAs Good as I Once Was\u201d (2005), about getting his manhood tested in middle age, notably by a pair of twin sisters who proposition him at a bar. In one of his biggest hits, \u201cBeer for My Horses\u201d (2002), he and Nelson pined for the days when you could \u201cround up all them bad boys, hang them high in the street,\u201d before meeting up with your posse at \u201cthe local saloon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven as he became a regular atop the country charts, Mr. Keith was not fully embraced by the Nashville establishment. He could be gruff and combative, fighting with record executives over his music and image (they wanted to dress him in suits, not jeans), and received only three Country Music Association awards out of 28 nominations.\n\nBut he proved adept at picking his battles and turning controversy to his advantage. \u201cThe secret in this business,\u201d he told The Washington Post, \u201cis to make enough people hate you enough to get them to talk about you.\u201d\n\nThat was especially true in 2002, when his song \u201cCourtesy of the Red, White and Blue\u201d brought him a new level of renown and notoriety. The single featured lyrics that referenced the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and promised that the United States would take vengeance on its attackers. \u201cYou\u2019ll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A.,\u201d Mr. Keith sang, \u201c\u2019cause we\u2019ll put a boot in your ass, it\u2019s the American way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Mr. Keith told it, he had never planned to record the track, only to sing it at USO shows and other military performances. He changed his mind with encouragement from Gen. James L. Jones, the Marine Corps commandant, who told him, \u201cThat\u2019s the most amazing battle song I\u2019ve ever heard in my life.\u201d\n\nThe single rose to the top of the country chart while also prompting debate over its lyrics, notably after Mr. Keith was invited to sing at a Fourth of July television special broadcast by ABC. He was apparently dropped from the show after the host, news anchor Peter Jennings, objected to his performing \u201cCourtesy of the Red, White and Blue\u201d in full.\n\nA spokesperson for the network said logistical issues, rather than a debate over lyrics, had kept Mr. Keith from being booked for the program. But the incident inspired fans of the singer to send hundreds of cowboy boots to Jennings\u2019s office in protest and led Mr. Keith to poke fun at the anchor by suggesting that Jennings might have disliked the song because he was born in Canada.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Keith later embarked on a high-profile feud with Natalie Maines, the lead singer of the Dixie Chicks, who deemed his song \u201cignorant\u201d and who sparked a backlash for publicly criticizing President George W. Bush and the impending 2003 invasion of Iraq. In response, Mr. Keith broadcast a doctored photo of Maines at his concerts, showing her embracing Saddam Hussein.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cThat was funny for a night or two, and then it was a little over the top for me,\u201d he told reporters at a roundtable event in October 2003, explaining that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d about his role in the squabble. \u201cShe\u2019s getting kicked enough without me piling on.\u201d\n\nMr. Keith was often lumped together with outspoken conservative musicians like Ted Nugent, although he noted that he was a longtime Democrat before becoming a registered independent in 2008. His only political message was support for the troops, he said, and not necessarily for the wars they were sent to fight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you listen through his catalog, you\u2019ll hear nods to a certain chicken-fried multiculturalism,\u201d journalist Spencer Kornhaber wrote in the Atlantic, noting a line from the singer\u2019s 2014 single \u201cDrunk Americans\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019re all mudflap suburbans, all ball caps and turbans.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Mr. Keith often pointed out that he sang at presidential events for Bush and Barack Obama. He later played at an inaugural concert for Donald Trump and said he accepted the gig over concerns that associating with the controversial new president would damage his reputation.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t succumb to that kind of pressure, you\u2019ll always come out stronger,\u201d he said at Nashville\u2019s Country Radio Seminar in 2017. \u201cYour fans will love you more, your friends will love you more, your peers will respect you more. At the end of the day, you just get another notch on your gun belt.\u201d\n\nToby Keith Covel was born in Clinton, Okla., on July 8, 1961, and grew up in Moore, on the outskirts of Oklahoma City. His father was an Army veteran who worked in the oil business and introduced him to the western swing music of Bob Wills, who became an early musical influence along with country singer Merle Haggard and Southern rock groups like the Marshall Tucker Band.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Keith started playing the guitar at age 8 and spent summers working for his grandmother, who owned a nightclub in Fort Smith, Ark., where he packed empty beer bottles into boxes and slipped out of the kitchen to sit in with the house band.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, he spent four years working in the oil fields. He later played defensive end for the semipro Oklahoma City Drillers before turning his focus to music, going on tour in the 1980s with a group of friends known as the Easy Money Band. They took their name after earning $1,000 for performing at a wedding, their first gig.\n\nMr. Keith released his self-titled debut on Mercury Records in 1993 and left the label after it turned down a set of songs that became his hit 1999 album \u201cHow Do You Like Me Now?!\u201d According to Mr. Keith, executives feared that the title song, a cheeky rejoinder to a woman who rejected him before he became famous, would alienate his female fans. Instead, it became his fourth No. 1 country hit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the commercial success of \u201cCourtesy of the Red, White and Blue,\u201d Mr. Keith released a string of crossover hits, reaching the top of the Billboard album chart with \u201cUnleashed\u201d (2002) and \u201cShock\u2019n Y\u2019all\u201d (2003), a reference to the Iraq War.\n\nBuilding on his musical success, he became a pitchman for a long-distance telephone service and launched a short-lived acting career, appearing in a 2008 movie version of \u201cBeer for My Horses.\u201d He also started a foundation to support children with cancer.\n\nMr. Keith married Tricia Lucus in 1984. He adopted her daughter, Shelley Covel Rowland, and had two other children, Stelen Keith Covel and country singer Krystal Keith. Information on survivors was not immediately available.\n\nMr. Keith was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2015 and later received the Merle Haggard Spirit Award for songwriting and the National Medal of Arts. He seemed to have a clear sense of what listeners liked about his music, and what songs fell short of their expectations.\n\nIn contrast to straightforward singles like \u201cShe\u2019s a Hottie,\u201d for instance, down-tempo tunes like \u201cLove Me If You Can\u201d \u2014 which referenced homelessness, Jesus and free speech \u2014 played well on the radio but didn\u2019t sell many copies. \u201cWhen I do it in my show,\u201d Mr. Keith observed, \u201cit\u2019s kind of where everybody gets up to get a beer and take a leak.\u201d\n\nOther singles were silly but infectious, like \u201cRed Solo Cup,\u201d which was written by brothers Brett and Jim Beavers and Brad and Brett Warren, and was one of the few Keith hits that he didn\u2019t write or co-write. \u201cIt is the stupidest song I ever heard in my life, but it\u2019s so stupid it\u2019s good,\u201d he told the country website the Boot.\n\n\u201c\u2018Red Solo Cup\u2019 is like a squirrel loose in a church house,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can play it in an office and then play five other songs, give it an hour, walk out, and you\u2019d hear the receptionist singing it. It\u2019s like nursery-rhyme stupid.\u201d"}

A top adviser has vowed to destroy the career of Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), House Freedom Caucus chair, after he endorsed another Trump challenger, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The Trump campaign has also attempted to condemn former aides who worked for his rivals during the GOP nomination fight and have twisted arms demanding endorsements, telling lawmakers that Trump will remember exactly when they backed him.\n\n\u201cMAGA disowns her and anyone else that associates/works with her,\u201d read a recent Trump campaign social media message targeting the Trump campaign\u2019s 2020 communications director for working last year to elect DeSantis. \u201cTRAITOR!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven new House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has been dragged into the crossfire. One of his top political consultants, Jason Hebert, works for Axiom Strategies, a consulting company that advised the DeSantis presidential effort. A Trump adviser called Johnson after he won the speakership to warn him not to work with Axiom, according to multiple people familiar with the call, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose internal details. Hebert, a college friend of Johnson\u2019s, is expected to start billing his work for Johnson through a company not tied to Axiom, one of the people said.\n\nThe high-dollar donor community, which has been told in various ways to rally quickly behind Trump, has taken notice.\n\n\u201cPeople took that as, \u2018I am going to be president and I am going to investigate you,\u2019\u201d said Katon Dawson, a former South Carolina GOP chairman and Haley backer, when Trump threatened to punish her donors. \u201cThere is always a threat. If you are not for him he\u2019s against you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s top advisers say the efforts to cajole and punish within the party are not a central part of their strategy, and some close to Trump point out that the former president can be quick to forgive when it is in his interest. Trump has long distinguished himself as both surprisingly vicious and disarmingly transactional, often willing to forgive intractable enmity for short-term gain.\n\nHours after DeSantis endorsed him, Trump dropped use of his vicious nicknames \u2014 saying he was retiring them \u2014 and praised the Florida governor. This past week, Trump\u2019s top aide, Susie Wiles, addressed some of the country\u2019s most affluent donors in Palm Beach, Fla. In her presentation, Wiles did not make threats, and instead shared data and attempted to woo the donors with a carrot-more-than-stick approach, people with knowledge of the meeting said.\n\n\u201cThe campaign is singularly focused on one thing \u2014 beating Crooked Joe Biden and winning back the White House,\u201d said Steven Cheung, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has complained repeatedly to advisers that Republicans are not loyal enough and often shares more anger for Republicans who buck or criticize him than for Democrats. In 2021 and 2022, he made it a near-singular mission to defeat Republican lawmakers who voted for his impeachment and who publicly disputed his claims of election fraud.\n\nThere are other signs that Trump\u2019s team has used a heavy hand. His campaign sent word to other operatives that if they worked for DeSantis, they would no longer be able to work for Trump, according to people with knowledge of the comments. One message sent to former aide who did not heed the warnings read, \u201cRIP,\u201d according to a person familiar with the exchange.\n\nThe former president\u2019s advisers have discussed trying to change personnel at the Republican National Committee to install people they view as more in line with Trump and controlled by Trump\u2019s campaign, according to people familiar with the discussions. It is unclear exactly how they would do this, but Trump said in a Sunday morning interview with Fox Business that there would be changes at the RNC. The former president has discussed trying to immediately remove Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) from his Senate leadership post should he be reelected, and has told advisers that he would want to immediately fire Christopher A. Wray, who was appointed by Trump as FBI director, following multiple federal investigations since he left office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome allies have kept lists of Republicans who have been critical of Trump in a bid to block them from getting jobs in a second term, according to a person with knowledge of the list. \u201cYou have a lot of people who want to come back in, but we remember what people have said in the past,\u201d one longtime Trump ally said.\n\nDuring a grueling primary, Trump has told advisers that he wants to make sure Ron DeSantis is not the GOP presidential nominee in 2028 and that he wanted to make his 2024 loss painful, people who heard his comments said. He has floated attacking lesser-known senators for not immediately endorsing him, according to people who have spoken to Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s team turned up the pressure on endorsement holdouts ahead of the Iowa caucuses, and the former president quickly embraced the January endorsement of Texas Sen. John Cornyn (R) just months after calling him \u201chopeless\u201d in a social media post. Trump warned Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R), who resisted calls to endorse Trump in 2021, that he \u201cmust be very careful\u201d about his 2024 reelection race in a December social media post, while aides leaked word that Trump was talking of doing something more to punish his former 2016 rival. Cruz endorsed Trump after the Iowa caucuses, and Trump embraced the move as \u201cwonderful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTexas House speaker Dade Phelan (R) led the impeachment effort against Texas attorney general Ken Paxton (R), a Trump ally, and later endorsed Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Just days later, Trump endorsed Phelan\u2019s opponent, saying in a social media post that Phelan\u2019s support did \u201cnot mitigate the Absolute Embarrassment Speaker Phelan inflicted upon the State of Texas and our Great Republican Party!\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nHe obliquely threatened Haley during his speech in New Hampshire, saying she would soon be under investigation for various things \u2014 without naming them \u2014 and allies of Trump have fanned rumors about her personal life.\n\nHaley, as Trump\u2019s last opponent for the nomination, has tried to make Trump\u2019s efforts to punish fellow Republicans a central message of her campaign. She has said she represents a different, more unifying kind of politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a president who is supposed to serve every person in America, and you are deciding that you are going to have a club and actually ban people from being in and out of your club?\u201d she said in a recent Fox News interview.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R), a major backer of Trump, joined the pressure game during an appearance in New Hampshire with Trump, when he took a jab at his own state education superintendent, Ellen Weaver, for being the only statewide elected official who has not yet endorsed the former president. Trump advisers and allies in South Carolina have pressured Weaver, who has demurred, saying she did not want to take a position in the race, people with knowledge of the talks said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a rookie and she will figure it out before long,\u201d McMaster said about Weaver. Since those comments, Weaver and McMaster spoke privately, according to people familiar with the call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther conflicts have been fueled in public by Trump\u2019s staff, who made a point of attacking consultants and supporters of DeSantis last year as part of a campaign to create discord within his operations. Chris LaCivita, a top aide to Trump, repeatedly attacked Axiom strategist Jeff Roe, who had previously auditioned for a role in the Trump campaign.\n\nTrump has told advisers that his opinion of Roe, who he once praised publicly as a formidable strategist, has changed after watching the now-shuttered DeSantis campaign because he now views him as a \u201closer,\u201d in Trump\u2019s words. Trump has nonetheless endorsed a number of candidates who have Axiom as a consultant.\n\nSeveral Axiom employees who worked for Trump in 2020 went to work for DeSantis. When one of them, Erin Perrine, appeared on Fox Business in January she was immediately targeted by the Trump campaign\u2019s social media account, which called her out after Fox chose to identify her as a former Trump adviser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe chose to side with DeSanctimonious and nothing can ever wash that foul stench,\u201d the Team Trump post said, using a derogatory Trump nickname for the Florida governor.\n\nLaCivita was also behind a recent attack on Good, a congressman from his home state of Virginia for endorsing DeSantis. Aides were upset by Good\u2019s suggestion that DeSantis had a better chance than Trump of winning a general election.\n\n\u201cBob Good won\u2019t be electable when we get done with him,\u201d LaCivita said in a text message to Cardinal News, a publication that covers politics in southern Virginia.\n\nSuch moves have cast a pall over the Republican caucus, quieting public challenges to Trump\u2019s control of the Republican Party. One of the reasons more Senate Republicans have begun endorsing Trump, according to a strategist with knowledge of the talks, is they would prefer to avoid his wrath if he becomes the nominee. Trump\u2019s endorsements in 2022 Senate races were decisive in multiple contested primaries, though several of those candidates later lost the general election.\n\nJohnson has told people that he speaks to Trump regularly and tries to solicit Trump\u2019s opinion.\n\nPeople close to McConnell say he has assiduously avoided fighting with Trump even when goaded by others to do so \u2014 or even when Trump has attacked his wife, former transportation secretary Elaine Chao. After the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, McConnell held Trump responsible, calling his actions beforehand \u201ca disgraceful dereliction of duty\u201d and \u201cunconscionable behavior.\u201d McConnell described Trump\u2019s political clout as \u201cdiminished\u201d after the 2022 elections. The two men have not spoken since 2020, and McConnell has largely avoided even saying Trump\u2019s name.\n\nMcConnell has yet to endorse Trump, but he has also refrained from making any recent critical statements. \u201cI\u2019ve stayed essentially out of it,\u201d he told reporters on the day of the New Hampshire primary. \u201cAnd when I change my mind about that, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d"}

Because pigeons are a \u201ccommon species,\u201d the camera-equipped birds could conceal their intelligence collection \u201camong the activities of thousands of other birds,\u201d according to the CIA, which also developed such a camera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the International Spy Museum in Washington, pigeons were \u201cdistinguished by their speed and ability to return home in any weather.\u201d\n\nThose same qualities make pigeons good for racing \u2014 a much more common use of the birds these days. During races, pigeons are released sometimes hundreds of miles from home and owners wait for them to return.\n\nColin Jerolmack, a professor at New York University and the author of \u201cThe Global Pigeon,\u201d said it was \u201cquite comical\u201d that Indian authorities saw Chinese writing and assumed espionage, especially considering the enormous popularity of pigeon racing there and the fact that China has many \u201cmore sophisticated\u201d tools than a pigeon.\n\nOnce dubbed \u201cthe poor man\u2019s horse racing,\u201d it is becoming big business, he said, noting that winning pigeons can fetch tens of thousands of dollars at auction \u2014 or much more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Taiwanese competitions, rather than racing over land, pigeons are brought out to sea and released 124 miles to 310 miles offshore, said Ya-Ching Huang, a researcher at Boston University who has studied Taiwan\u2019s pigeon racing culture. Because of this format, \u201cit\u2019s not uncommon for pigeons to end up landing in neighboring countries or on boats that take them even further away,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile pigeon fanciers maintain that the birds receive great care during training, animal rights groups and ethicists have long criticized the sport. According to PETA, millions of pigeons die every year in Taiwan\u2019s seasonal races, with many drowning from exhaustion, dying in storms or being killed for being too slow.\n\nIn racing and espionage, \u201cpigeons are used as tools for human ends,\u201d said Jan Deckers, a researcher at Newcastle University in Britain who studies animal ethics. \u201cNo pigeon chooses to release themselves a long way away from their lofts and to carry messages, tags or rings back home.\u201d"}

If European nations agree to the 2040 target, it would put the E.U. on track to meet a much bigger goal, in 2050, of \u201cnet zero\u201d carbon neutrality.\n\nThe E.U. has long touted this transition as an opportunity, not a sacrifice, but it is unclear if it can deliver on it.\n\nFarmers, facing tightened environmental rules and other challenges, have held recent protests in at least a half-dozen E.U. countries. Right-leaning parties skeptical of some climate regulations are poised for a major win in European parliamentary elections later this year. The \u201cgreenlash\u201d is building, from France to Ireland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being pontificated to from the top down,\u201d said Tommy Lane, a beef farmer in Ireland, where new rules designed to reduce organic nitrogen pollution are forcing farmers to consider culling herds.\n\nThe target for 2040 is merely a recommendation from the European Commission, the E.U.\u2019s executive branch, and must be approved by its member nations \u2014 an uncertainty, given the political climate. Countries have the right to voice concerns or set a lower target, and will begin debate next month.\n\nSince unveiling its Green Deal in 2019, Europe has positioned itself at the forefront of the global transition, unveiling a flurry of climate-friendly policies, targets and rules. The E.U. now accounts for just seven percent of global emissions, compared to 13 percent two decades ago. The bloc also rapidly built up its wind and solar capacity to offset cutbacks in Russian gas imports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even those steps haven\u2019t put the E.U. on track to reach its targets \u2014 including the first major marker, for 2030, of a 55 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels. The E.U.\u2019s climate advisory board said last month that reductions would need to \u201cincrease considerably,\u201d and it noted the need for much more progress in areas, such as agriculture and building efficiency, where changes would likely be politically unpopular. People would need to renovate their homes in massive number to bring them up to standards, for instance.\n\nThe European regulatory approach differs substantially from that in the United States, where Congress has declined to endorse carbon taxes and climate restrictions, prompting the Biden administration to prioritize carrots \u2014 financial incentives \u2014 over sticks to boost clean energy.\n\nPolls show that concern about climate change is higher in most major European countries than it is in the United States. But even Europeans, according to polls, tend to balk at steps that would cause a personal financial hit. According to a YouGov poll conducted last year in seven European countries, including Britain, most of those surveyed expressed opposition to increased fuel duties or higher airfare. There was widespread support, on the other hand, for government subsidies to make homes more energy efficient, or for a ban on single-use plastics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the draft document about the target, obtained by The Washington Post, the Commission appeared to acknowledge the backlash, saying it is \u201caware of the worries that some citizens and industrial actors have and some of the pushback to individual measures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe imperative that this transition has to be just is at the heart of this work,\u201d the document said. \u201cClimate action has to take everybody along.\u201d\n\nWhile weighing its 2040 target, Europe put out a call for feedback, and it received plenty, from all sides, numbering in the thousands \u2014 from think tanks and companies and ordinary citizens. As an example, major German airline Lufthansa wrote to the Commission that it wanted the global playing field to remain \u201clevel,\u201d including for aviation, during Europe\u2019s green transition. A citizen from the Netherlands sketched out the opposite vision: Tax airlines, the person suggested, and use the proceeds from more expensive air travel to improve Europe\u2019s train system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome people who wrote to the Commission, on the other hand, said the entire Green Deal was taking an undo social toll. One person from the Czech Republic described \u201cbureaucratic Soviet-style interventions\u201d that were hurting Europe while other countries refused to play their part in the climate transition.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThat sentiment is helping center-right and far-right parties, who are expected to gain seats after the June vote. The European Council on Foreign Relations, in a recent policy brief, outlined how a more right-leaning parliament would have thwarted a recently-passed measure \u2014 opposed by farmers \u2014 aimed at protecting biodiversity. The brief said that a \u201csignificant shift to the right in the new parliament will mean that an \u2018anti-climate policy action\u2019 coalition is likely to dominate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis would significantly undermine the E.U.'s Green Deal framework and the adoption and enforcement of common policies to meet the E.U.\u2019s net zero targets,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSusi Dennison, a senior policy fellow and one of the authors of the report, said that early aspects of the Green Deal \u2014 like the emissions trading scheme \u2014 felt too complicated to register with most Europeans. But more recent steps, such as the planned 2035 ban on traditional gasoline cars, are more concrete, and come at a sensitive time when Europeans are already worried about daily costs and security.\n\n\u201cThis is the phase we\u2019re going to: [green measures] having more impact on individual lives,\u201d Dennison said. \u201cThat is where you\u2019re starting to see the greenlash.\u201d\n\nThe most obvious sign of concern comes from farmers, who have taken to the streets in multiple European countries, blaring tractor sirens in Berlin, or blocking highways outside of Paris. The motives for the protests differ slightly from country to country, but in both France and Germany, farmers were facing cuts to diesel subsidies. France\u2019s union last Thursday called for a halt to the protests after the government made several concessions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, agricultural groups say that farmers feel targeted by environmental regulation, and sense more is likely to come. The E.U. heavily subsidizes the agriculture sector, and emissions \u2014 coming from fertilizer use, manure and cow burps \u2014 have remained essentially flat for years.\n\nThat has made the sector symbolic of the tough steps ahead. Some policymakers have gone so far as to suggest that cow herds need to be reduced, and that Europeans should consume less meat.\n\nThe farm sector has pushed back. The farm association in Ireland, where farming contributes to 40 percent of national emissions, says that government policy is trying to \u201cregulate farmers out of business.\u201d At an event last year, the then-association president, Tim Cullinan, said that farmers wanted to play their role in dealing with climate change, but that \u201cwe will not allow farming to become the sacrificial lamb where cutting out a cultural activity is seen as a fast-track solution to reduce overall national emissions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLane, the Irish farmer, and a local association leader, described in an interview how Ireland, for years, had been given an exemption from European rules on organic nitrate levels. But that exemption is now expiring, and because organic nitrogen comes from manure, the only way to deal with the declining threshold \u2014 measured in kilograms per hectare \u2014 is to obtain more land or reduce the number of animals.\n\n\u201cThe next generation, do they want to put up with the level of uncertainty? The level of regulation?\u201d Lane said. \u201cTo go into a career that cannot guarantee that you will remain viable for the lifetime of your career?\u201d\n\nOthers across Europe have made the case that sticking with green policies is essential, and ultimately profitable, helping E.U. industries become global leaders in the energy transition. In addition, many multinational corporations operate in Europe, and by changing their practices to comply with E.U. emissions targets, such corporations would be more likely to clean up their operations in the United States and other countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEurope has also experienced a wave of severe climate disasters, including heat waves and wildfires. Sticking to most ambitions of the Paris agreement means \u201cmarkedly fewer economic losses compared to grappling with the fallout of climate impacts,\u201d said a recent report from the Climate Action Network Europe."}

(AP) \u2014 A pair of California lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill on Tuesday to allow people 21 and older to consume psychedelic mushrooms under professional supervision as part of an agenda to tackle the state\u2019s mental health and substance use crises.\n\nIt comes after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom last year vetoed legislation that would have decriminalized the possession and personal use of several plant-based hallucinogens, including psychedelic mushrooms. It was the first time the proposal by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener made it through the legislature after years of stalling. In his veto message, Newsom, who championed legalizing cannabis in 2016, asked lawmakers to work on therapeutic guidelines and regulations.\n\nNow Wiener has teamed up with Republican Assemblymember Marie Waldron on a proposal to allow participations to consume psilocybin \u2014 the hallucinogenic component in what\u2019s known as psychedelic mushrooms \u2014 under the supervision of a licensed therapist. The bill also would include dimethyltryptamine (DMT), MDMA and mescaline.\n\nColorado and Oregon have already decriminalized psychedelic mushrooms and establish regulated systems for therapeutic use of the substances. In California, San Francisco, Oakland and Santa Cruz have effectively decriminalized possession of psychedelic mushrooms, meaning a person cannot be arrested or prosecuted for possessing limited amounts of plant-based hallucinogens.\n\n\u201cWe know that Californians are struggling with mental health and addiction challenges, and we know that psychedelics, particularly when combined with therapeutic support, can be a powerful tool to help people get their health back,\u201d Wiener said at a Monday news briefing. \u201cWe know that California veterans and first responders have particularly benefited from these substances, and we know that many more people can as well.\u201d\n\nWaldron, who introduced a different bill to study the use of psychedelic therapy, said the bipartisan bill aligns with Newsom\u2019s vision by providing safeguards around psychedelic therapy. A person would have to go through a comprehensive screening to determine if they\u2019re fit to consume hallucinogens for therapy and engage in follow-up assessments.\n\nThe bill also would shift the state\u2019s response to mental health crisis away from criminalization and punishment, Waldron said.\n\nCalifornia already has \u201ca massive network\u201d of underground therapists who provide psychedelic therapy, Wiener said. He added the bill would \u201cbring them above ground\u201d through a new state licensing board that regulates the services.\n\nThe legislation does not allow for personal possession and use. That means clients can\u2019t buy the substance to go. The drugs would still be illegal under federal law. Wiener said he doesn\u2019t want to wait on actions from the federal government and that state lawmakers could authorize such regulated psychedelic use, similar to previous efforts to legalize therapeutic use of cannabis to treat cancers or HIV.\n\nTouted as a mind-bending drug in the 1960s, psychedelic mushrooms have been used in religious or spiritual practices in some cultures for centuries and possibly thousands of years. Some researchers believe psilocybin and other drugs show promise in treating depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The Food and Drug Administration in 2018 designated psilocybin a \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d and published draft guidance last year for researchers designing clinical trials for psychedelic drugs.\n\nThe bill is sponsored by Heroic Hearts Project, a nonprofit working with veterans to overcome trauma. Juliana Mercer, a Marine Corps veteran and a Heroic Hearts Project board member, said she\u2019s used psychedelics to manage her PTSD through programs outside of the U.S. Her organization recently sent a group of veterans to Oregon for regulated psilocybin use.\n\n\u201cThrough education and through regulation, we\u2019ll be able to take people from doing this underground, where it may not be safe, into a place where they can do it safely,\u201d Mercer said.\n\nShe added that will allow them to \u201caccess the healing that they deserve without fear of negative repercussions.\u201d\n\nThe California Coalition for Psychedelic Safety and Education, which opposed the measure to decriminalize psychedelics last year, also joined to support the bipartisan bill this year. Susan Sagy, executive director of the group, called it an approach \u201cthat balances the potential benefits of therapeutic treatment with the potential risks to public health.\u201d\n\nProponents of the bill anticipate it would take 18 to 24 months to implement the program if the bill becomes law. The bill would also create an education program to help reduce the stigma around psychedelics."}

One of the biggest fears when it comes to the biggest sport\u2019s biggest games might just be that a high-profile bad call or no-call will play a role in the result.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, if something happens in the Super Bowl, that is going to stay with you the entire offseason. That is going to really direct and control the narrative around the finish. You can have a great year and you can have smooth sailing \u2014 and then something goes wrong in the Super Bowl, and that\u2019s all people are going to remember,\u201d said Dean Blandino, who was a replay official for two Super Bowls before a stint as the NFL\u2019s head of officiating. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that is a major, major concern.\u201d\n\nTeam owners, front-office executives, coaches and players don\u2019t want that.\n\nNeither do fans \u2014 or gamblers (who, aside from a vested interest in the final score, can wager on the total number of penalty yards or which coach will challenge a call first in the Super Bowl).\n\nNeither does the league. And neither do those wearing the black-and-white uniforms.\n\n\u201cNo official wants to be part of the story,\u201d said Mike Pereira, who worked on the field for NFL games and later oversaw all of the league\u2019s officiating. \u201cNone of them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough when an error comes in the regular season, dominating next-day conversation, as seemed to happen repeatedly in 2023-24. It\u2019s worse when it comes in the postseason. Worst of all is when it appears to directly affect a key game\u2019s outcome, such as when a crew run by Vinovich \u2014 yes, there\u2019s that name again \u2014 completely missed an obvious penalty (or two) late in the NFC championship game in January 2019, when the Los Angeles Rams beat the New Orleans Saints to reach the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t ever get over it,\u201d Saints general manager Mickey Loomis said.\n\nAnd make no mistake: Mistakes happen. Of course they do, even if Pereira thinks \u201cthe percentage of correct calls is better than in my day.\u201d Social media and TV attention mean late-game miscues \u201cbecome talked about ad nauseam,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about officiating during a media session in Las Vegas on Monday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he thinks \u201cthe level of scrutiny is at the highest I\u2019ve ever seen it,\u201d and so, \u201ceven when an official gets it right, there\u2019s criticism.\u201d\n\nObserves Scott Green, who officiated in three Super Bowls and now is the head of the NFL Referees Association: \u201cQuarterbacks throw interceptions. Coaches make bad decisions. We\u2019re human beings just like they are and there will be mistakes, and they are visible. If the public wants 100% correct, that\u2019s unfair. That\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nWhat can\u2019t be debated is the significance of the role officials have in each game. That\u2019s why, for one thing, teams prepare each week with an eye to who\u2019ll be carrying the yellow flags.\n\nOffensive linemen worry about how holding will be judged; defensive linemen are concerned about hitting quarterbacks, particularly high or late; linebackers fret about where the line will be drawn when it comes to proper tackling; defensive backs find themselves focusing on how \u201chandsy\u201d they can be with receivers.\n\n\u201cPenalties affect every game; some more than others,\u201d Ravens safety Kyle Hamilton said after Baltimore lost to visiting Kansas City in the AFC championship game late last month.\n\nAfter some calls went against the Ravens, video screens in Baltimore\u2019s stadium flashed a message intended to get spectators to chant \u201cDe-fense!\u201d in support of the home team. Instead, thousands chose a different two-syllable word \u2014 hint: the first part was \u201cBull\u201d \u2014 for an impromptu and collective commentary.\n\nAs with so much these days, conspiracy theories abound related to whether officiating calls \u2014 in all sports, not only the NFL, mind you \u2014 could result from bias on the part of an individual or, indeed, a league.\n\nAnother issue: Some rulings are open to interpretation, which means a particular official can view what happens differently than a player or coach or announcer or partisan fan does.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing some rules being emphasized for the sake of satisfying society\u2019s softness in a game that is not a soft game at all,\u201d said Detroit Lions fullback Jason Cabinda, whose club was on the wrong end of one of this season\u2019s most-disputed calls. \u201cYou got to be brave. You got to have courage. This isn\u2019t basketball; this isn\u2019t lacrosse. You better have your head on a swivel because you can get it knocked off. They\u2019re trying to change that.\u201d\n\nWhile Goodell called the current officiating \u201csuperior,\u201d he also acknowledged the NFL needs to try to improve in that area.\n\nHow? Others have offered suggestions.\n\nMaybe hire more full-time officials, the way other sports such as Major League Baseball, the NHL and NBA do \u2014 although, it must be said, no one close to the situation can agree on whether that would make a difference in the NFL. Pereira thinks it would make sense to at least have the referees who oversee each crew be full-timers.\n\nMaybe make more penalties reviewable, something former New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees would like for roughing-the-passer flags. Then again, Brees said, no one wants more time spent on reviews.\n\nMaybe institute the sort of mea culpa reports the NBA uses to acknowledge late-game refereeing errors, though Pereira wouldn\u2019t welcome the additional after-the-fact scrutiny.

(AP) \u2014 Nearly 68 million American adults \u2014 about 1 in 4 \u2014 plan to bet on this year\u2019s Super Bowl, setting a record by a wide margin, according to the gambling industry\u2019s national trade association.\n\nFigures released Tuesday by the American Gaming Association include bets placed with legal outlets, as well as with illegal bookies and online operations in other countries.\n\nThe volume of betting participation is projected to be 35% higher than last year, which was the previous record.\n\nBettors plan to wager an estimated $23.1 billion on this year\u2019s Super Bowl, up from $16 billion last year, the group predicted.\n\nOf that, about $1.5 billion is projected to be bet with legal outlets, the group said, citing consensus estimates from various sources. That is in the same ballpark as the $1.25 billion in legal bets projected by Irvine, California-based research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.\n\nSports betting is legal in 38 states plus Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that every Super Bowl for the next ten or so years will be the most bet Super Bowl thanks to the underlying growth of regulated sports betting in the U.S.,\u201d said gambling analyst Chris Grove, a partner at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.\n\nSunday\u2019s game will feature the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs against the San Francisco 49ers in a rare rematch from four years ago.\n\nThe 49ers are favored by 2.5 points, meaning they would have to win the game by 3 or more points for bets on them to be winners. Conversely, if the Chiefs win, or if they lose by no more than 2 points, bets on Kansas City would win. Those odds are from FanDuel Sportsbook, the official odds provider for The Associated Press.\n\nThe romance between Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce and pop superstar Taylor Swift might be helping drive interest in this Super Bowl. About 73% of adults say they plan to watch the game this year, about 10% higher than in recent previous years.\n\n\u201cI think the \u2018Taylor Swift effect\u2019 will be more obviously felt in terms of the total number of people watching and betting on the game than it will be in the total dollars bet on the game,\u201d Grove said. \u201cBut there\u2019s little doubt that sportsbooks will be seeing Swifties sign up that otherwise would not have given sports betting a second thought.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Cait DeBaun, a vice president with the American Gaming Association, said Swift could be one of several reasons for increased betting on this year\u2019s Super Bowl, along with \u201cthe compelling matchup,\u201d the game being held in Las Vegas, the nation\u2019s betting capital, and the growing availability of legal sports betting in the U.S.\n\nThe largest group in the survey \u2014 42.7 million adults \u2014 plans to place a wager online (legally or illegally), at a retail sportsbook or with an illegal bookie, an increase of 41% from last year.\n\nAbout 36.5 million adults plan to bet casually with friends, or as part of a pool or squares contest, up 32% from last year.\n\nBettors are nearly split on the outcome of the game, with 47% planning to bet on the Kansas City Chiefs and 44% planning to bet on the San Francisco 49ers, according to the association\u2019s survey conducted Jan. 30 through Feb. 1 of a national sample of 2,204 adults. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nEilers & Krejcik forecasts that nearly 13% of money bet with legal sportsbooks will come from Nevada, where the game will be played. That is followed by New York (12.4%), New Jersey (9.6%); Pennsylvania (7.4%), Illinois (7.3%); Ohio (7%) and Arizona (5.6%). Other states are projected to account for 3.6% or less individually.\n\nAbout 10% to 15% of legal bets will be made live after the game already has begun, the company predicted.\n\nBrian Becker, senior vice president of Tipico Sportsbook, is among many gambling industry executives who predict a record-breaking betting level on this year\u2019s Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cThe game-watching experience has become more immersive than ever before,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we approach Super Bowl Sunday, we also expect the festivities in Las Vegas to have a ripple effect across the country and entice more fans to place bets than in years past with the microscope of media and advertising on Vegas culture.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Wayne Parry on X, formerly Twitter, at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC"}

That news should help the U.S. stock market, which has gained 1.6% as measured by the S&P 500 index on a year-to-date basis. And it's not just the S&P 500. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 38,000 for the first time on Jan. 25. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite saw its highest close (15,628.04) in two years on Jan. 29.\n\nOn the downside, consumers are still fretting over high prices at grocery stores, though costs are expected to tick downward in 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Overall, food prices rose 2.7% from December 2022 to December 2023. Household kitchen staples like eggs and lettuce have declined in price, but beef and sugar prices rose from 2022 to 2023.\n\n\n\nFactor in still-record-high home prices, labor volatility that's led to tens of thousands of layoffs so far in 2024 (U.S. technology companies have already laid off nearly 30,000 employees this year) and stagnant wages, and the American consumer isn't raising any champagne glasses to the U.S. economy in early 2024.\n\nWhat does that mean for the U.S. stock market, which seems to be on the upswing this year? So far, it means continued uncertainty leading into a volatile U.S. presidential election season and more household finance angst in 2024.\n\n\"Views are mixed on the outlook of the stock market in 2024,\" said Steve Crews, a Calgary, Alberta-based mortgage lending specialist and founder of Golden Road Reborn, a global stock market trading system. \"Some traders predict a flat or down market in the first half of 2024 due to high inflation, recession fears and rate hikes from the Fed. However, others foresee a bull market continuing, citing potential Fed rate cuts, earnings growth and historical trends around election years.\"\n\nWhat are the key facts that could move the markets into deeper waters in 2024? Here are six keystone issues that could impact the financial markets this year:\n\n1. High Stock Valuations\n\nWhile valuations are stretched versus long-term S&P 500 averages (currently selling at 19 times next year's earnings, compared to a 55-year average of 16), interest rate fluctuations should drive stocks in 2024 \u2013 if they head in a certain direction.\n\nExcessively high valuations could lead to a problem with stock performance for the rest of 2024.\n\n\"The S&P 500's current forward price-to-earnings ratio is around 20, compared to about 17 at this time last year,\" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, wrote in the company's Jan. 8 investment committee weekly report. \"Meanwhile, the 'equity risk premium' \u2013 i.e., the reward an investor can expect for owning stocks over risk-free Treasurys \u2013 is at an extreme low of about 1 percentage point.\"\n\nIf you stretch the current valuation outlook along to the end of 2024 and into 2025, you can get a more accurate predictor of returns. \"On that score, today's valuation levels point to subpar annual stock returns, with gains averaging 4% compared to the long-run average of 7% to 8%,\" Shalett said.\n\n2. Overdependence on Leading Stocks\n\nThe so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2013 Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA) \u2013 were undisputed victors in 2023.\n\nThe Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index returned 107% in 2023 compared to the S&P 500's 24%, primarily due to upbeat company fundamentals for the major technology companies for the year, as noted by David Polak, equity investment director at Capital Group, in recent commentary.\n\n\"These companies not only benefited from their early investments in artificial intelligence, they also helped drive the S&P 500 higher, since the index is weighted by market cap,\" said Kelly Milligan, managing partner at Quorum Private Wealth in Danville, California.\n\nThere's just one problem: Most of the overall stock market gains last year were derived from the Magnificent 7 stocks. Any deviation from that performance could lead to market underperformance in 2024.\n\n3. Wishful Thinking on Interest Rates\n\nI nvestors may be counting on the Federal Reserve to aggressively curb interest rates in 2024, but Morgan Stanley's Shalett believes that may be wishful thinking.\n\n\"The market continues to assume that the Fed will cut rates more quickly and steeply than it has publicly signaled,\" she said. \"Despite the Fed's signaled intent to cut rates three times this year, futures markets are pricing more than six. That assumes the central bank will enjoy an uninterrupted victory in taming inflation, whereas we believe inflation in labor-intensive services is still likely to persist.\"\n\n\n\n4. Consumer Exhaustion\n\nU.S. credit card users are digging a deep hole with plastic debt. Credit card delinquencies were up across the board in the third quarter of 2023, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Those delinquency figures encompass credit card debt that's 30, 60 and 90 days past due, the Philly Fed reported.\n\nAdditionally, consumer non-mortgage interest payments have risen by 50% on a year-to-year basis, cresting $1 trillion in Q3 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n\"The burgeoning 'living beyond means' character of the consumer can most easily be seen when looking at consumers' revolving credit ... and the associated increase in serious credit card delinquencies,\" Charles Schwab investment strategists Liz Ann Sonders and Kevin Gordon wrote in a recent research report. \"Those delinquencies are particularly acute among younger borrowers. For now, healthy wage growth has kept the ratio of credit card debt to compensation historically low; but further weakening of wage growth will cause the ratio to climb.\"\n\nDownbeat consumer sentiment could weigh heavily on stocks, given that consumer spending accounts for about 70% of GDP, Sonders and Gordon noted.\n\n5. Stubborn Inflation\n\nCurrently, the U.S. inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) stands at 3.4%, with the Fed noting that inflation should fall below 2.5% in 2024 \u2013 still above the Fed's 2% target rate. It's worth noting that the Fed's preferred measure of inflation is the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index.\n\nSome economic experts point to the ties between worker wages and inflation, which remains high in early 2024. As U.S. Bank notes, average hourly earnings growth remains above 4%, which is \"still higher\" than the Fed prefers.\n\n\"If we look at the Fed's definition of progress on inflation, (the Fed wants) to get it closer to their target of 2% per year,\" says Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. \"The question is how much further inflation must level out before the Fed is again willing to change course on interest rates.\"\n\n6. A Roiling 2024 Presidential Election\n\nWith the Republican Party set to nominate former President Donald Trump and the Democratic Party circling the wagons behind an unopposed President Joe Biden, the 2024 election season has landed.\n\nGiven that polling numbers are down for both candidates, that landing shows more \"thud\" than \"bounce\" \u2013 and that's a big issue, given history shows that major election years have a significant impact on the financial markets.\n\n\"Going back to 1980, stocks have rallied in the year following an election, on average,\" says Greg Sweeney, chief investment officer at Bell Bank in Bloomington, Minnesota. \"So while volatility may pick up with the unknown heading into an Election Day, stocks tend to forge ahead as uncertainty fades.\"\n\nWhile the Fed is hitting the brakes on rate hikes (and yields tend to fall pretty quickly when that scenario occurs), market volatility already exacerbated by the election could be further triggered.\n\n\"This means cash carries reinvestment risk, and today's elevated bond yields offer an opportunity to lock in higher income potential for longer,\" J.P. Morgan Wealth Management investment strategists Madison Faller and Shawn Snyder said in a recent research note. \"We're most excited about municipal bonds, with their tax treatment offering an even bigger pick-up in yield alongside limited default risk.\"\n\nSteps to Crash-Proof Your Investment Portfolio in 2024\n\nDespite the Fed's \"higher for longer\" interest rate strategy that could hamper business and consumer finances in 2024, U.S. financial markets seem headed for a smooth landing this year.\n\n\"We aren't as confident about that, but we still see opportunities in a total-portfolio context,\" Kate El-Hillow, Russell Investments' president and chief investing officer, noted in the company's 2024 Global Market Outlook. \"Government bonds look valuable as yields exceed inflation and could become more appealing as a hedge against stock market volatility. We prefer quality equities for their relative value and defensive characteristics.\"\n\nReal estate investment trusts, or REITs, and global listed infrastructure are also attractive and \"should benefit from longer demographic and technology trends,\" El-Hillow said. Consumers should also focus on asset allocation as the year proceeds, as portfolio diversification and active management are big issues in what could be a volatile 2024 financial market landscape.\n\n\"This goes beyond stocks and bonds and addresses broader macro factors such as inflation, growth and trade,\" El-Hillow noted. \"Next-generation diversifiers such as real assets and private credit offer additional benefits in this context. As monetary policy changes, diversification within the growth side of portfolios will become more relevant, but elevated volatility will make it critical to be selective.\"\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to stock market breadth, one of the most important developments to watch in 2024 (i.e., the number of market indexes, sectors, styles and individual stocks that are participating in the stock market's uptrend.)\n\n\"At the end of the third quarter of 2023, small-cap, mid-cap and the average U.S. stock were all down year to date, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up largely due to their concentration in a small number of large-cap growth stocks,\" said Thomas Samuelson, chief investment officer at Vineyard Global Advisors in Castle Rock, Colorado. \"The encouraging development in the fourth quarter of 2023 is the rallies being seen in small-cap, mid-cap and the average U.S. stock, foreign developed and emerging stocks.\""}

But organoids grow with much less cellular organization and inter-connective ability than the new 3D-printed tissue.\n\nWith his lab's new process, \u201cwe printed the cerebral cortex and the striatum, and what we found was quite striking,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cEven when we printed different cells belonging to different parts of the brain, they were still able to talk to each other in a very special and specific way.\u201d\n\nReporting Feb. 1 in the journal Cell Stem Cell, the Madison team said their 3-D printing technology has improved on prior attempts to create 3D-printed brain tissue.\n\nThe Madison lab's tissues include neurons created from stem cells, and they are oriented in a different pattern than was used in prior attempts.\n\nThe cells are also embedded in a softer form of \"bio-ink\" gel than was used previously.\n\nAs Zhang explained it, \u201cthe tissue still has enough structure to hold together, but it is soft enough to allow the neurons to grow into each other and start talking to each other.\"\n\nThis means that disparate brain cells in the new tissue use neurotransmitter chemicals to send signals to each other. They can even form neural networks, as is seen in living brains, Zhang's group said.\n\n\u201cOur lab is very special in that we are able to produce pretty much any type of neurons at any time. Then we can piece them together at almost any time and in whatever way we like,\u201d Zhang added. \u201cBecause we can print the tissue by design, we can have a defined system to look at how our human brain network operates. We can look very specifically at how the nerve cells talk to each other under certain conditions because we can print exactly what we want.\u201d\n\nThe Madison crew believe their new 3D-printed tissue could be easily used by most research labs. It does not require special equipment and scientists can investigate neurological processes using standard microscopes.\n\nPotential applications include studies into Down syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, brain development and the creation of experimental drugs, the researchers said.\n\nThe key breakthrough here is that the 3D-printed tissue forms real neurological networks, Zhang said.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we have often looked at one thing at a time, which means we often miss some critical components. Our brain operates in networks,\" he said. \"We want to print brain tissue this way because cells do not operate by themselves. They talk to each other. This is how our brain works, and it has to be studied all together like this to truly understand it.\"\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about how the brain works at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nSOURCE: University of Wisconsin-Madison, news release, Feb. 1, 2024"}

From fewer original series and movies to greater scrutiny of budgets and a further squeeze on movie theater profits, people who call the shots said the television and film industries are adjusting to sober economic realities.\n\n\u201cThe great contraction is upon us,\u201d said one veteran television executive, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cI think there will be a significant retrenchment in the quantity of content, and the amount spent on content.\u201d\n\nThe contraction story will figure prominently as Walt Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Fox report quarterly results this month. It is also the backdrop for media merger chatter, most recently sale talks between the owner of Paramount Global and Skydance Media CEO David Ellison, the media mogul whose studio co-produced \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d\n\nAnalyst TD Cowen estimated broadcast and cable television advertising will end 2023 down 7% from the prior year, with total advertising declines of 11.7% at Disney, according to LSEG. Warner Bros Discovery reported a 13% decline in advertising for the first nine months of 2023. Along with print and radio, traditional TV has been \u201chollowed out\u201d by digital advertising.\n\nThe outlook for 2024 is not much better. TD Cowen forecast that broadcast and cable TV ad revenue would fall another 7%. Even though the media companies are expanding their digital ad businesses, the sinking traditional TV business still accounts for 80% of their total advertising revenue, according to TD Cowen.\n\nStreaming services, which were supposed to carry the industry into the future, are also struggling to reach profitability after years of profligate spending. As the industry enters what MoffettNathanson describes as the \u201cthird act of the streaming wars,\u201d production spending will fall below 2022 levels, when competition stoked \"never sustainable\" investment.\n\nMost streaming services are charging more while delivering less new content, feeding skepticism over their long-term strategy, according to TD Cowen.\n\nThe overall number of scripted series is expected to shrink dramatically from the pinnacle of 633 shows released in 2022. The combination of the Hollywood strikes and constrained spending dented production last year, with just 481 U.S. series released in 2023, according to data from market research firm Ampere Analysis.\n\nEven market-leading Netflix slashed the number of scripted series it released by more than one-third from 2022 to 2023, Ampere said. The profitable streaming service, which reported record subscriber gains in its fourth quarter, declined to comment.\n\nExecutives who spoke to Reuters said the industry could shed more scripted series and hit the 300-shows range in coming years.\n\nIn 2024, the domestic box office will continue to feel the impact of the actors and writers strikes, with just 90 films offered for wide release this year, down from around 100 in 2023, according to MoffettNathanson. With a film slate heavy in untested stories and characters, U.S. box office sales are expected to be $8 billion in 2024, down 10% from 2023 and down 30% from 2019.\n\n\u2018NEW WORLD ORDER\u2019\n\nThe industry is slowing down, executives said. Development executives are taking longer to greenlight shows, even for projects from established showrunners like Ronald D. Moore, whose credits include \u201cFor All Mankind\u201d and \u201cOutlander.\u201d\n\nProduction budgets are contracting -- including at the streaming service Apple TV+, whose cash-flush corporate parent, Apple, boasts a market capitalization of $3 trillion. Both examples are reported here for the first time.\n\nShows that fail to grab an audience are being canceled quicker, as with the Disney+ series \u201cAmerican Born Chinese,\u201d an adaptation of a groundbreaking graphic novel featuring two Oscar winners, Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan.\n\nOne senior television agent called it \u201cthe new world order,\u201d with shorter seasons and fewer episodes per season.\n\nFox is looking to slash spending on one prestige drama to $4.5 million per episode from $10 million. At Disney, where CEO Bob Iger is fending off activist shareholders, development executives are under deeper scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all a bit scared about what to do next,\u201d said one prominent talent manager.\n\n\"SUPERHERO FATIGUE\"\n\nThe movie business is having its own existential crisis as once reliable formats have fallen flat at the box office. One longtime studio chief said he has been hearing for years about \u201csuperhero fatigue.\u201d That was in full display last year, when a procession of big-budget but poorly received films, including \u201cThe Marvels,\u201d \u201cShazam: Fury of the Gods\u201d and \u201cThe Flash,\u201d fell short of expectations.\n\nIn response, industry insiders say studios will focus on fewer but more ambitious endeavors, with the potential to deliver \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d-sized cultural and box-office impact. Both films helped prop up a 2023 box office where well-established franchises fell flat.\n\n\u201cYou've got to have a spectacle,\u201d said one studio executive associated with one of the biggest blockbusters in recent years. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be, \u2018You have to see it while it\u2019s in the theater.\u2019 We can\u2019t greenlight something large scale, if you could probably watch this at home and it\u2019s just as good.\u201d\n\nAudiences are gravitating to streaming services to watch all but the biggest, loudest, films, noted TD Cowen. Just 19 action/adventure films accounted for 56% of the total box office for the top 100 films of 2022. The outlook for a sustained recovery, beyond this type of high-adrenaline flick, is questionable, TD Cowen noted.\n\nThat will further constrain cinemas, said another longtime media executive and investor, who warned there will be too few films released to justify maintaining 39,000 screens in the U.S., a sentiment echoed by TD Cowen. The theater business, this executive said, is \u201cteetering on disaster.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles, edited by Kenneth Li and David Gregorio)"}

D\u00edaz\u2019s mother was quickly rescued by police, while his father was released 12 days later following numerous protests and petitions.\n\nAccording to Colombia\u2019s Defense Ministry, the National Liberation Army is holding at least 38 hostages. The group has asked the government to provide it with alternate ways to finance its operations, while talks continue to take place.\n\nMonday\u2019s statement said that the conditions under which the rebels will cease kidnappings will continue to be discussed in an upcoming round of talks in April."}

James Martin, a Jesuit who is one of the country's most prominent advocates for greater LGBTQ+ inclusion in the Catholic Church.\n\nOutreach, a ministry of the Jesuit magazine America, sponsored conferences in New York City in 2022 and 2023, and last year launched a multifaceted website with news, essays and information about Catholic LGBTQ+ resources and events.\n\nOn Tuesday, there was another milestone for Outreach \u2014 the appointment of journalist and author Michael O'Loughlin as its first executive director.\n\nO'Loughlin, a former staff writer at online newspaper Crux, has been the national correspondent at America. He is the author of a book recounting the varied ways that Catholics in the U.S. responded to the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and \u201890s \u2014 \u201cHidden Mercy: AIDS, Catholics, and the Untold Stories of Compassion in the Face of Fear.\u201d\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nO'Loughlin told The Associated Press he's excited by his new job, viewing it as a chance to expand the range of Outreach's programs and the national scope of its community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to highlight the ways LGBT people can be Catholic and active in parishes, ministries and charities,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear about to being too public about it. ... I want them to realize they\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nO'Loughlin says his current outlook evolved as he traveled to scores of places around the U.S. to promote his book, talking to groups of LGBTQ+ Catholics, and their families and friends, about how to make the church more welcoming to them.\n\nThose conversations made O'Loughlin increasingly comfortable publicly identifying as a gay Catholic after years of wondering whether he should remain in the church. Its doctrine still condemns any sexual relations between gay or lesbian partners as \u201cintrinsically disordered.\"\n\nThe latest expansion of Outreach occurs amid a time of division within the global Catholic Church as it grapples with LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nPope Francis, a Jesuit who has met with Martin and sent letters of support to Outreach, has made clear he favors a more welcoming approach to LGBTQ+ people. At his direction, the Vatican recently gave priests greater leeway to bless same-sex couples and asserted that transgender people, in some circumstances, can be baptized.\n\nHowever, there has been some resistance to the pope's approach. Many conservative bishops in Africa, Europe and elsewhere said they would not implement the new policy regarding blessings. In the U.S., some bishops have issued directives effectively ordering diocesan personnel not to recognize transgender people's gender identity.\n\nAmid those conflicting developments, Martin and other Jesuit leaders are proud of Outreach's accomplishments and optimistic about its future.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be deep hunger for the kind of ministry that we\u2019re doing, not only among LGBTQ Catholics, but also their families and friends,\u201d Martin said by email from Ireland, where he was meeting last week with the the country's Catholic bishops.\n\n\u201cPope Francis has been very encouraging, allowing himself to be interviewed by Outreach and sending personal greetings to our conference last year,\u201d Martin added. \u201cPerhaps the most surprising support has been from several bishops who have written for our website, as well as some top-notch Catholic theologians who see the need for serious theological reflection on LGBTQ topics.\u201d\n\nMartin will remain engaged in Outreach's oversight, holding the title of founder.\n\nThe Rev. Brian Paulson, president of the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States, evoked both Jesus and the pope when asked why his order had embraced the mission of Outreach.\n\n\u201cPope Francis has repeatedly called leaders in the Catholic church to emulate the way Jesus spent his ministry on the peripheries, accompanying those who had experienced exclusion,\u201d Paulson said email. \u201cI think the work of Outreach is a response to this invitation.\u201d\n\nPaulson also said he was impressed by Martin's \u201cgrace and patience\u201d in responding to the often harsh criticism directed at him by some conservative Catholics.\n\nThere was ample evidence of Outreach's stature at its conference last June at a branch of Fordham University in New York City. The event was preceded by a handwritten letter of support sent to Martin by Pope Francis, extending \u201cprayers and good wishes\u201d to the participants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special grace for LGBTQ Catholics to know that the pope is praying for them,\" Martin said.\n\nAnother welcoming letter came from Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York.\n\n\u201cIt is the sacred duty of the Church and Her ministers to reach out to those on the periphery,\" he wrote to the conference attendees.\n\nThe keynote speakers included Fordham's president, Tania Tetlow, and the closing Mass was celebrated by Archbishop John Wester of Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

People with AMD might see the clock's numbers, but not the hands.\n\nMost patients have early or intermediate dry AMD, which can remain stable for a lifetime or can slowly degrade a person\u2019s vision, experts say.\n\nDry AMD occurs when parts of the macula get thinner with age, the AAO says.\n\nEarly dry AMD might involve no symptoms at all, while people with intermediate dry AMD might have difficulty reading in dim light or transitioning from light to dark, the ASRS says.\n\nIntermediate patients also might notice a decrease in the intensity or brightness of colors, or find that straight lines are becoming wavy and distorted.\n\nThe advanced stage of dry AMD is called Geographic Atrophy (GA). It causes marked distortion of straight lines, gradual loss of central vision, or dark and blurry areas in the center of vision, the ASRS says.\n\nNo current treatment can prevent vision loss of patients with GA, but two drugs recently approved by the FDA can help slow its progression, the ASRS says. Both drugs are eye injections that patients receive every one to two months.\n\nThere also are nutritional supplements that can help patients with intermediate dry AMD. These over-the-counter supplements include vitamin C, vitamin E, lutein, zeaxanthin, zinc and copper, the AAO says.\n\nWet AMD occurs when abnormal and leaking blood vessels develop beneath the macula, the ASRS says. The condition can cause rapid and severe vision loss in one or both eyes.\n\nTreatment of wet AMD has been revolutionized by the discovery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a signaling protein that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels, the ASRS says.\n\nWet AMD can\u2019t be cured, but its progression can be halted with anti-VEGF eye injections that block the action of the signaling protein, the ASRS says.\n\nNewer versions of anti-VEGF drugs now are extending the time between treatments, meaning that patients need fewer office visits and receive fewer injections each year, the ASRS says.\n\nThe ASRS recommends that people with vision loss contact a retina specialist. These eye doctors have completed up to a decade of advanced training specializing in the retina.\n\nThe primary risk factor for macular degeneration is old age, and genetics also play a powerful role in the disease, the ASRS says.\n\nOther risk factors include:\n\nSmoking.\n\nObesity.\n\nHigh blood pressure.\n\nPoorly controlled diabetes.\n\nExcessive sun exposure.\n\nToo few fruits and vegetables in the diet.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology has more about age-related macular degeneration.\n\nSOURCE: American Society of Retina Specialists, news release, Feb. 1, 2024\n\nWhat You Need to Know:\n\nPeople should have regular eye exams to keep tabs on the health of their retinas, and take other steps to delay age-related macular degeneration."}

A flood of cheap Chinese solar panel imports is driving record solar energy installations. But those same imports are crushing Europe's few local solar manufacturers.\n\nGovernments and industry are split over how to respond.\n\nEurope just had a bumper year for green energy. European Union countries installed record levels of solar capacity, 40% more than in 2022. The vast majority of those panels and parts came from China \u2013 in some cases, 95%, International Energy Agency data show.\n\nYet the green energy boom hasn't helped Europe's few local solar panel manufacturers, which have hit crisis point, crushed by cheaper imports and oversupply. Announcements of production closures are piling up, and the sector has warned half of its capacity could shut within weeks unless governments step in.\n\nPolicymakers are scrambling to respond, but are split over how to do so.\n\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck wrote to the European Commission in November, expressing concern that the EU executive was about to slap trade restrictions on Chinese solar imports, a letter seen by Reuters showed.\n\n\"I have heard that the Commission may be intending to impose safeguard measures against imports of photovoltaic (PV) modules from China. I have very strong concerns about this,\" the letter said.\n\nHabeck warned restricting Chinese imports could kill off Europe's rapid expansion of green energy and make 90% of the PV market more expensive. It risked bankruptcies among EU companies that assemble and install solar panels using imported parts, he said.\n\nA spokesperson for Germany's economy ministry declined to comment on the letter.\n\nGermany's own planned support for the sector has been thrown into turmoil by a government budget crisis.\n\nElsewhere, Spain has not ruled out tariffs on imports of solar panel materials. The Netherlands wants to cover solar PV imports with the EU's carbon border tax, a government official told Reuters. And Italy last week announced a 90 million euro ($97 million) investment in a PV panel factory in Sicily.\n\nPRICE WAR\n\nIn a speech on Monday on the solar sector's problems, EU Financial Services Commissioner Mairead McGuinness offered no new support. She pointed to EU measures already underway, including a law due to be finalised on Tuesday, which aims to fast-track permits for local manufacturing and to give products made in the EU, such as panels, an advantage in future clean tech tenders.\n\nOn trade restrictions, McGuinness struck a cautious tone.\n\n\"Given that we currently rely to a very important degree on imports to reach EU solar deployment targets, any potential measure needs to be weighed against the objectives we have set ourselves when it comes to the energy transition,\" she said.\n\nIndustry itself is divided over the solution. Solar manufacturers have urged governments to step in to buy up excess inventories of solar modules to ease the oversupply - and, if this cannot be done fast, consider trade barriers.\n\nBut the broader green energy industry is opposed to import curbs.\n\n\"You can't reduce dependency on China in the short term or you don\u2019t build the projects,\" Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade, CEO of Portuguese utility EDP, told Reuters.\n\nHe noted that solar panel prices have climbed in the United States, which has duties on Chinese imports. \"It is having an inflationary impact ... the price of panels is more than double that of Europe,\" he said.\n\nEven local manufacturers say hopes of a competitive local industry are dim.\n\nEurope is in a \"price war\" with China, said Gunter Erfurt, CEO of Swiss panel maker Meyer Burger, which plans to close its loss-making German solar module factory, citing an absence of supportive European policies.\n\nWith some Chinese solar firms able to sell even below production costs, Europe is playing catch up. \"The solar industry in China has been strategically subsidised with hundreds of billions of dollars for years,\" Erfurt told Reuters.\n\n($1 = 0.9310 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Kate Abnett and Nina Chestney.

The authors noted that it\u2019s not known whether the mushrooms were seized in normal or dried form, which prevents weight measures from being directly translated into possible doses.\n\nThese seizures jibe with research suggesting that psilocybin is the most consumed plant-based psychedelic drug in the United States, with more than 11% of people ages 12 and older reporting ever having used psilocybin, researchers said.\n\n\u201cWe are in the middle of a rapidly evolving cultural, media and legal landscape when it comes to psychedelics, and we need data to help shape informed and appropriate public health strategies,\u201d NIDA Director Dr. Nora Volkow said in a news release.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, we must continue to track data on the availability of psychedelics, patterns in use and associated health effects, to guide efforts in promoting accurate education and reducing potential harms among people who do plan to use psychedelic drugs,\u201d Volkow added in a NIDA news release.\n\nPsilocybin research has focused on using psychedelics as part of structured therapy under the supervision of a clinician and in a controlled environment.\n\nHowever, most people using psychedelic drugs do so outside of therapy, either for recreation or based on the believe that \u201cshrooms\u201d will improve their well-being or aid in spiritual growth or self-exploration, researchers said.\n\n\u201cBad trips\u201d from psilocybin can cause intense fear, anxiety and confusion, researchers noted. Users\u2019 thinking and perception can become distorted, and they might unintentionally place themselves in physical danger as a result.\n\nPsychedelic drugs also can cause side effects like increased blood pressure and heart rate, agitation, confusion, vomiting or nausea, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cMost national surveys and studies don\u2019t capture self-reported data on psilocybin use specifically, so these findings help shed important light on an area where we\u2019ve been largely left in the dark,\u201d said co-researcher Linda Cottler, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida.\n\nMore information\n\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about psilocybin.\n\nSOURCE: National Institute on Drug Abuse, news release, Feb. 6, 2024"}

Horner has denied the claims and the team has still to make any formal comment regarding the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe team\u2019s owner, energy drink manufacturer Red Bull, confirmed on Monday that it had launched an investigation into the 50-year-old\u2019s conduct after a complaint. The accusations are believed to have been made by a female member of staff and were taken up with the owners rather than the Red Bull Racing team itself.\n\nQuick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

Thank you for your feedback.\n\nHorner, who remains in his post during the investigation, has made an emphatic rebuttal, stating: \u201cI completely deny these claims\u201d but has yet to make any further comment. The parent company, Red Bull, have also stated making any further statements would not be appropriate while the investigation, being carried out by an external barrister, is ongoing.\n\nHorner has been team principal at Red Bull since the drink manufacturer bought the team when it was Jaguar in 2004. He is now entering his 20th season with them and has enjoyed a remarkable period of success but it is understood that his position would be untenable if the allegations against him are proved.\n\nThe Williams team principal, James Vowles, said that while he did not have any insight into the allegations themselves or the \u201csignificance of what has happened\u201d that the sport had to take all such issues seriously.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is should this happen on our guard we would be entirely supportive in terms of fixing it and making sure we have a culture that is accepting of everyone,\u201d he added in an interview with Bloomberg when questioned about the allegations. \u201cIt means we all have to look at each other in the mirror and make sure we are posing the right questions internally and acting in the way we can only be proud of, not today but in the next 10 years.\u201d\n\nReports have noted that there is believed to be an internal power struggle in the background at Red Bull Racing. Horner was the youngest F1 team principal when Red Bull appointed him in 2005. He is now the longest serving principal in the paddock and has steered Red Bull racing to extraordinary success during that period. They have won six constructors\u2019 world championships and seven drivers\u2019 titles and have enjoyed remarkable dominance over the last two seasons, both won comfortably by Max Verstappen, with Red Bull claiming 21 wins from 22 races in 2023. Horner was instrumental in bringing both designer Adrian Newey to Red Bull and Verstappen to F1, when he was just 17 years old."}

Did they have the opportunity to say there are some inconsistencies here?\n\n\u201cSubpostmasters consistently raised these concerns; we are not digging into what the detail is and getting to the truth of these matters. There was somebody on that board who had a responsibility to give the government\u2019s perspective on decisions that were made at the Post Office.\u201d\n\nThe UKGI chief executive, Charles Donald, said its representative was just one of the board members and it had provided the inquiry with 96 pages of \u201creflections\u201d in an opening statement on themes such as governance.\n\n\u201cI think there were questions to be asked,\u201d Donald said. \u201cCollectively I think there are questions to be asked about the curiosity of the board.\n\n\u201cWe have to slightly leave the inquiry to ask what questions may have been asked and not asked. There are a whole set of questions the inquiry will answer best.\u201d\n\nAngela Eagle, the Labour MP for Wallasey, pointed out that the UKGI non-executive director was on the board at the crucial moment in 2019 when a group of subpostmasters won a high court case quashing their convictions. She said: \u201cSurely the non-executive director should have alerted the government at the time to the gathering problem?\u201d\n\nDonald said the then non-executive director, Tom Cooper, \u201cpushed\u201d the board to set up a separate committee to look at the litigation the Post Office was involved in and that information was being \u201cfed back\u201d, adding that the Post Office was in regular contact with the Department for Business and Trade at the time.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Agriculture was responsible for 12%, electricity supply 14% and industry 14%. Fuel supply was responsible for 8%, and waste 4%. Land use and forestry created 0.2% of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nDomestic transport emissions rose 2% year on year, but government officials mostly attributed this to a bounce-back from the coronavirus pandemic. There was a significant drop in transport emissions in 2020, when people stayed at home due to lockdowns, and travel has not yet recovered to pre-2020 levels.\n\nGovernment policies, such as scrapping high-speed rail projects, building more roads and failing to ensure that rail travel is as reliable and affordable as driving, mean that emissions are unlikely to fall to levels needed to reach net zero, experts have said.\n\nEmissions from buildings fell by 13%, but this is mostly because the unseasonably warm year meant that people used less heating, as well as high energy prices causing people to cut back on their use, according to the government figures.\n\nExperts said that government policies meant this fall was unlikely to be sustained, particularly as ministers are expected to drop targets for heat pumps, and home insulation is hitting record low rates.\n\nDoug Parr, the policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cAny reduction in emissions is welcome news, but this is no time to be complacent. Homes and transport remain the biggest emitters, with stubbornly high levels persisting, and the plans for dealing with them don\u2019t cut the mustard.\n\n\u201cBuilding insulation rates dropped to an all-time low, and yet the government looks set to roll back policy on cleaning up heating. Similarly they overturned targets for electric vehicles and allowed disinformation about electric vehicles to grow. This is not a moment for celebration, but to realise how much more there is to do.\u201d\n\nThe Climate Change Committee, the UK\u2019s independent watchdog that is tasked with ensuring the country meets emissions goals, has said that the country is not on track to meet the its nationally determined contribution under the UN process for a 68% reduction in emissions by 2030.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

Making active travel more accessible, increasing funding for public transport, rolling out electric vehicles, retrofitting homes with heat pumps and insulation are all solutions which in addition to bringing down emissions would also create jobs and cut bills. Rishi Sunak\u2019s net zero delay, announced at the end of last year, will have a tangible effect in slowing our progress.\u201d\n\nThe energy security secretary, Claire Coutinho, said: \u201cThe UK is the first major economy \u2013 of the top 20 countries \u2013 to halve its emissions. This is an enormous achievement by itself but also because we have done this in a pragmatic way \u2013 growing our economy by 80% at the same time and protecting family finances.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have also increased our renewables electricity generation from just 7% in 2010 to nearly 50% now. With some of the most ambitious targets in the world, we should be proud that we\u2019ve over-achieved on our carbon budget for the third time in a row. We will continue to meet out targets but in a pragmatic way that doesn\u2019t clobber extra costs onto hard-working families.\u201d"}

Consider its premise: posh southern boy fancies working-class northern lass \u2026 for two decades. He grew up in the Cotswolds and is planning on spending the summer after graduating from university in France \u201cwith the Marlborough lot\u201d. She tours dusty village halls with plays about suffrage and pauses to put on Joan Armatrading\u2019s Love and Affection before she gets off with someone. It doesn\u2019t sound plausible. Or touching. Or funny. Or relevant to our times, which have travelled so far beyond \u201cclass-conflicted\u201d that I can\u2019t summon a word vicious enough for them.\n\nAnd yet. When David Nicholls\u2019 third novel came out, in 2009, it won over every person who read it, even the ones who don\u2019t do romantic comedy. It was so funny and unpretentious, so heartfelt and true. The film that followed was weirdly awful, but let\u2019s treat that as the rebound relationship instantly excised from your romantic history so you can love again. Because we now have the hot 2020s version. And this one\u2019s a keeper.\n\nA limited series is the perfect format for One Day, a love story at once epic \u2013 spanning 20 years \u2013 and quotidian, with all the action taking place on a single date, 15 July, St Swithin\u2019s Day. Each half-hour episode, bar the heart-wrenching finale, covers a day, beginning in 1988 with Dexter Mayhew (Leo Woodall) and Emma Morley (Ambika Mod) meeting on the night of their graduation from Edinburgh uni. This neatly carves up the story into 14 highly bingeable slices of wistfulness.\n\nThe format made me realise what One Day is really about: the poetry of day-to-day life and the power of nostalgia. As Philip Larkin wrote in the poem that opens this flawless adaptation, written by a team led by Nicole Taylor (Wild Rose) and executive-produced by Nicholls: \u201cWhere can we live but days?\u201d\n\nEach episode is an exquisite miniature set-piece. There is the 15 July when Dexter, now an unravelling TV presenter, goes home to visit his dying mum and screws everything up. Even the abandoned exercise bike in his old bedroom and the Bugsy Malone video on the shelf bring a lump to my throat. And the woozy summer\u2019s day when Em and Dex get a bottle and a bag of Kettle Chips from the off-licence, lie on Primrose Hill and watch the sundown. And the excruciating round of the parlour game Are you there, Moriarty? when Dex accidentally whacks his new, even posher girlfriend in the face with a rolled up copy of the Times.\n\nThe supporting cast is superlative, the period details magnificent, the soundtrack sublime. By the time Rip It Up by Orange Juice comes on, I am a mess, capable of falling apart at the sight of a hamburger phone.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to What's On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are extraordinary. Woodall\u2019s wide-boy charisma and frightful yet endlessly forgivable privilege are perfectly pitched; I forgive him a thousand times. His poshness is neither glossed over nor glamorised; it is simply integral.\n\nAmbika Mod (This Is Going to Hurt) is such a revelation that it is hard to believe this is her first lead role. Her Em is flinty, vulnerable, committed and relentlessly deadpan. On the hungover morning after they meet, they pass the time climbing Arthur\u2019s Seat. \u201cIs that a religious thing, not sleeping together?\u201d Dex asks. To which Em explains drolly that her mum is a Hindu and her dad a lapsed Catholic: \u201cGod wasn\u2019t involved.\u201d\n\nWhich brings me to a confession. My initial reaction to seeing Mod play Emma was complicated. I was thrilled: I\u2019ve never seen someone who looks like me, living the life I lived around the time I lived it, on screen before. But this is also why it didn\u2019t ring true. Because race (and class, for that matter) didn\u2019t work like that back then. By which I mean \u2013 I\u2019ll just say it \u2013 white boys like Dex didn\u2019t fancy brown girls like Em. I know because I was one, although I went to Glasgow. In the first few episodes, the unmentionability of Emma\u2019s race got to me. The truth is, Dex (and his parents) would have made unintentionally racist blunders. And Em would have forgiven him.\n\nBut then I kept watching. I started to fall for them, hard. And I began to appreciate the lovely Shakespearean bones of this story, which is about two wildly different people connecting through humour, shared cultural references and, above all, time. And, God, it passes so fast. Suddenly it is 15 July 1991, Dex and Em are skinny-dipping in Greece and I am all in. By the time it is 2007 and Dex is back in Edinburgh, where I ended up and from where I am writing these words, I am crying my eyes out and longing to do it all over again."}

Is there any way to stop them?", "domain": "theguardian.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBggKMJeqezDfswk", "text": "It is not quite accurate to say that the cyber-attack against the British Library took place on 28 October 2023. Most probably, Rhysida, the hacker gang that orchestrated the attack and is thought to be Russian, had already been creeping undetected through the digital territories of the British Library for months, Enrico Mariconti, a lecturer in security and crime science at UCL, told me.\n\nOnce it broke through to the library\u2019s virtual private network (VPN) \u2013 the remote connection that allows employees to access its network from any location \u2013 it could in theory start making its way through locked door after locked door of the library\u2019s many online systems, trawling until it discovered emails and documents containing details such as employees\u2019 passport scans and work contracts. It hoped these documents might tempt a single bidder to pay 20 bitcoins (about \u00a3600,000) for privileged access to all that personal information.\n\nEventually, after the British Library refused to pay a \u00a3600,000 ransom, the hackers published close to 500,000 files of what they called \u201cexclusive, unique and impressive\u201d stolen data for anyone to download for free through the dark web. An image of the aftermath of Rhysida\u2019s October attack might look like this: a national library from the pre-digital era, no wifi, no computer access, with even the phone lines dead. Except there was one crucial difference. No one could even make use of the British Library\u2019s enormous collection of 170m items. Three months later, the library is still in the initial stages of its recovery, with many of its services and systems still down. Rhysida\u2019s attack, according to Ciaran Martin, the previous CEO of the National Cyber Security Centre, is \u201cone of the worst cyber incidents in British history\u201d.\n\nLong gone are the days of the solo-hackers who broke through computer security systems for kicks and bragging rights, like the bleached-haired teens in the 1995 film Hackers. In February 2022, years of internal messages from a Russian ransomware group were leaked, offering a window into the logistical dynamics of hacker groups. The group in question often had more than 100 employees on its payroll, each working remotely on the various moving parts of its fastidiously planned cyber-attacks. Its workforce was ordered into numerous departments, each with its own budget, and it had a committed HR department. In the past few years, cybercrime has expanded from a cottage industry to a slick, specialised crime racket.\n\nRhysida is a ransomware-as-a-service group. This means anyone can contract it to target a victim of their choosing. Its clients need not have any native understanding of cybercrime, because Rhysida will do the heavy lifting. It discovers how to hack into its victim\u2019s private network, lift information, then encrypt the victim\u2019s data and send out the ransom note, having decided in advance on a number that will be significant but not enough to bankrupt the victim. Then, it liaises with the victim through a message portal, all the while providing the client with detailed analysis of its progress.\n\nIts motivations are varied. Mariconti told me he believes the British Library cyber-attack was probably a \u201cshowcase\u201d operation. High-profile attacks work like an advertisement for potential clients. \u201cIt says, \u2018Hey, we are able to attack a big institution,\u2019\u201d Mariconti said. \u201c\u2018Come to us, give us money, and we are going to take whatever you want.\u2019\u201d Then there is the opportunistic element. The British Library is a critically important site of knowledge, but unlike the NHS or GCHQ, a breach of its cybersecurity wouldn\u2019t cause an immediate threat to public safety, so there are fewer incentives for the government to improve its IT systems.\n\nThe future of cybercrime is beginning to look like any other arms race. There are many Russian-affiliated hacker groups, which tend not to carry out attacks on their own country (indeed, many strains of malware don\u2019t even work on Russian computers). Nicole Perlroth, formerly the lead cybersecurity reporter for the New York Times, summarises Russia\u2019s guidelines for hackers as follows: \u201cFirst, no hacking inside the motherland. And second, when the Kremlin calls in a favour, you do whatever it asks.\u201d Meanwhile, in Britain, the government\u2019s lack of investment in cybersecurity has turned the country into an open goal for potential aggressors (last year, the Treasury posted a job advert for a head of cybersecurity with a starting salary of \u00a350,000; the median salary for a head of cybersecurity role in the private sector is almost double that number).\n\nAnd then there is the other hidden cost undergirding this arms race: its environmental impact. To run the servers that are either building the malware or defending against such attacks requires enormous carbon emissions. In 2020, an American cybersecurity firm managed to decrypt the malware that had locked a technology manufacturer out from their data in a few hours using nearly 100 cloud computer servers. The cloud reportedly now has a greater carbon footprint than the airline industry.\n\nI asked Prof Mariconti if a solution to the increasing global threat from cyber-attacks would be to create stronger internal borders within the internet, so that each country\u2019s firewalls came more to resemble those in China, whose servers block much international traffic and international websites. \u201cThat goes against the logic of the internet,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe internet was born out of the idea of being able to communicate without restrictions all over the world.\u201d This double-sided quality has existed since the internet\u2019s very inception: freedom to roam without borders, and the potential misuse of such a liberty.\n\nAll that time the Rhysida hackers spent moving freely through the networks of the British Library, while we were down below in its physical reading rooms, naive to their existence, I wonder if they ever considered the irony of their attacks. The very conditions that have allowed them to conduct their trade across the open plains of cyberspace are those they now aim to abuse, by shutting down the possibility for communication and knowledge-sharing, stealing and encrypting information, forcing users to buy back or lose their data, and bringing vital institutions such as libraries \u2013 which protect and share all of this knowledge for anyone to access \u2013 to their knees."}

In 2018, she spoke out against Marsha Blackburn and supported Democratic candidates in Tennessee. During the 2020 election cycle, she endorsed Joe Biden and vowed to the then president Donald Trump on Twitter that \u201cwe will vote you out\u201d.\n\nIn recent weeks, a string of rightwing figures have begun to spread conspiracy theories claiming Swift is a \u201cPentagon asset\u201d who will influence the next presidential election by endorsing Joe Biden.\n\n\n\nHere, six US voters from across the country share what they make of Swift taking a stance on US political issues, what issues they would feel comfortable having Swift talk about, and whether the superstar could influence their vote.\n\n\u2018Could Taylor Swift influence my vote? Yes, absolutely\u2019\n\n\u201cI love that Taylor is getting political! Every American has the right to their own political ideas, and to express them.\n\n\u201cTaylor has a voice that is all caps, a megaphone. I\u2019d like her to take a stance on women\u2019s issues, youth issues, social issues, LGBTQ+ issues, the NFL draft, drug use, or anything else on her mind. Basically, any issue other than those affecting her personal business interests.\n\n\u201cI think she could, potentially, absolutely change my mind politically, because she is a strong woman who is a role model to my 24-year-old daughter and who is unafraid to speak her mind to old, misogynistic, males who can\u2019t find the ability to respect a woman, any woman. It is time we prepare the next generation of women for leadership. The far right are scared to death of Taylor, who has an opportunity to move the needle, to politically mobilise particularly young women and men, and I think she should.\u201d Michael Dee, 67, an investment banker from Dallas, Texas\n\n\u2018Her words are a drop in the ocean compared to the Maga machine\u2019\n\n\u201cI am very supportive of Taylor taking political stances. Country stars have supported Republicans for years and it didn\u2019t seem to bother anyone; now a smart successful woman has threatened the football Maga crowd. She\u2019s a smart, aware woman and any speaking she does is a drop in the ocean compared to the Maga machine that is everywhere. If she can prevent another attack on our fragile democracy she should please speak up. She\u2019d be a fool not to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like her to clear up issues [about which] Trump has gaslit people. He made a mess of things. Let her highlight his failures, his encouragement of the January 6 attack on the Capitol and his lies.\n\n\u201cI live in a Republican state, with cowboys and Trump people and pickup trucks driving around with flags. I\u2019m gonna vote for whoever will be the Dem candidate, but I\u2019m hoping Taylor can get a few more people here to vote Dems, educate them politically, people who don\u2019t read the papers.\u201d Roberta, retired, from South Dakota\n\n\u201cIt is concerning that Americans turn to icons like Taylor Swift, a musician, to advise them on how to vote. It further evidences that Americans are not really thinking for themselves but are under the sway of cultural and commercial influences.\n\n\u201cSwift is part of a global elite, whether she acknowledges it or not and no matter how much charity she does. She is now a billionaire, and even if she had $500m, $50m or $5m, she would still be living in a completely different world from most of her fans and most people in the United States.\n\n\u201cWhen Taylor Swift experiences an injustice, hundreds of millions of people hear about it in her songs or on the international news, creating the illusion that this injustice is significant to the lives of everyone else. I hate this new trend of celebrities becoming politicians and further capitalizing on their special privileges.\n\n\u201cIf Taylor Swift endorsed a presidential candidate, I would be angry. Americans do not need more noise in their already noisy election. We do not want musicians having that much power that they could sway a political election to one side or another. Leigh, 34, PhD student from San Francisco, California\n\n\u2018Taylor Swift\u2019s endorsement can influence me more than any man in DC\u2019\n\n\u201cShe should absolutely take a stance, as much as any American voter! Her stance and/or endorsement is one that I care about as much as my granddaughter does.\n\n\u201cI would like to hear her speak out in support of human rights for all, especially women. And to support the asylum-seeking refugees risking their lives to contribute their hard work to the US. That\u2019s what actually makes America great.\n\n\u201cFor me, Taylor Swift\u2019s endorsement holds more influence than any man in DC or in the media. Why wouldn\u2019t her opinion matter to me?\u201d Louise*, 72, an unpaid family caregiver from Florida\n\n\u2018She should guide her followers if she cares about them\u2019\n\n\u201cPeople who have influence have a duty to speak the truth to their flock. A good leader stands by principles they believe in and advocates for the greater good. If Taylor Swift truly cares about her followers then she will guide them to make a good decision at this crucial moment in time. No one on the right would critique a pastor advancing his world view into sermons, so why can\u2019t a singer?\n\n\u201cI think Taylor Swift can speak well on inclusiveness, anti-racism, women\u2019s rights, and democracy \u2013 fundamental values that shouldn\u2019t be controversial in modern America, but have been made vulnerable by rightwing fearmongering. She should avoid [talking about] the climate until she leads by example and doesn\u2019t fly from mansion to mansion on a private jet.\n\n\u201cMy vote would absolutely not be influenced by her: if she endorsed Trump I would just assume she\u2019s horrible. If she endorsed Biden I would be glad that she isn\u2019t a white supremacist.\u201d Jacob Phelps, 38, a registered nurse from Pennsylvania\n\n\u2018She should encourage her fans to make up their own minds\u2019\n\n\u201cI tend toward the liberal end of the spectrum but I\u2019m not dogmatic about it. Everyone should be engaged in our democracy. Because Taylor has built a successful career in music she can use her popularity to advocate for the things she cares about. More power to her.\n\n\u201cI hope she encourages everyone to become more active in our country\u2019s future. If she could convince people to value the diversity of our society and help to tone down the hate-filled rhetoric from both sides that would be a gigantic achievement.\n\n\u201cI think she would be far more effective if she didn\u2019t endorse a candidate but instead told her fans to study the issues and make up their own minds.\u201d Geoff Lusk, 58, pilates instructor from Denver, Colorado\n\n*Name has been changed"}

But for the past few years, the town has taken over, organizing a parade in her honor.\n\nOn Sunday, for Ceccarelli\u2019s 116th birthday party, a winter storm in the region had closed highways and felled trees. But the rain eased just in time.\n\nOutside, local officials were waiting for her with a proclamation honoring a long life well lived. The local dog walker, along with about 15 dogs, opened the parade for her, followed by the fire brigade, the garbage truck, and a line of cars decked in streamers and balloons.\n\nA trio of moustachioed local musicians serenaded her with guitars. Some small children dropped off flowers and handmade cards wishing her a happy birthday.\n\nAt 116, Ceccarelli has slowed down considerably. And while she fades in and out of lucidity due to dementia, on the morning of her party she was pleased to learn that everyone was there for her. \u201cOh!\u201d she said, as her caregiver straightened out her sweater and helped freshen up her lipstick \u2013 L\u2019Or\u00e9al True Red.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ceccarelli\u2019s cousin Evelyn Persico looks at old pictures of Ceccarelli on her desk in her bedroom. Photograph: Rachel Buljalski/The Guardian\n\nShe waved at the gaggle of press photographers and videographers. About 10 minutes into her birthday parade, she got too cold and tired, and needed to go back inside. But the festooned cars kept coming.\n\nCeccarelli has earned the rare distinction of supercentenarian, a person who has lived past 110; she is the second-oldest person in the world.\n\nShe was born and raised here, among the towering redwoods, in what used to be a lumber town. Most everybody in town knows her.\n\nAfter the parade, a crowd of relatives and friends waited outside to see her, then filed inside one by one, till no more could fit.\n\n\u201cShe is such a part of this community. So this is like, the third, fourth, fifth generation celebrating her,\u201d said Evelyn Persico, 83, a cousin by marriage. But there is a bittersweetness to the celebration. \u201cMany of her people have passed. So many of her old-timers are gone,\u201d she said.\n\nShe was born Edith Recagno in Willits on 5 February 1908, the year Henry Ford introduced the Model T. (A member of the local car club rumbled by in a restored Model T, as part of her birthday parade.)\n\nView image in fullscreen Neighbors walk the street with balloons for the parade.

Photograph: Rachel Buljalski/The Guardian\n\nShe was the eldest of seven siblings, born to Italian immigrant parents who themselves lived into their 90s. Her father worked in lumber, and for a brief stint sold groceries and supplies from a horse-drawn wagon. She graduated school in 1927 and a few years later married her high school sweetheart, Elmer \u201cBrick\u201d Keenan, who went on to work as a typesetter for the Santa Rosa Press Democrat, the regional paper. The couple adopted a daughter, Laureen, who grew up to have three children of her own.\n\nAfter her husband\u2019s death, she was remarried to Charles Cecarrelli for four years, before he died. By now, Ceccarelli has outlived all of her immediate family.\n\nIn 2012, when she was 104, she lost her longtime friend and dance partner, Ed Burton. But she wasn\u2019t ready to stop dancing. So she put out a letter in the local paper.\n\n\u201cI, Edith Ceccarelli, would like to keep on dancing, as would have my late friend and dance partner Ed Burton, whom I miss beyond words,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am looking for a dance partner. Dancing keeps your limbs strong. What is nicer than holding a lovely lady in your arms and dancing a beautiful waltz or two-step together? Try it, you will like it.\u201d She signed off with her phone number.\n\nA couple of people did respond, but nothing quite clicked. \u201cI tried dancing with her a couple of times,\u201d said her second cousin Chuck Persico, 79. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t keep up.\u201d\n\nFinally, at 109, she moved into Willits\u2019 Holy Spirit Residential Care Home, a small senior living facility where she lives with five other seniors. Cousins and friends visit with her, and her caretaker helps her keep her mouth rouged and her nails painted (cherry red, usually).\n\nView image in fullscreen Ceccarelli and Persico share a moment in Ceccarelli\u2019s living room. Photograph: Rachel Buljalski/The Guardian\n\nPersico, one of Ceccarelli\u2019s closest confidantes, now works with Ceccarelli\u2019s care team. They came up with the idea of throwing her a parade during the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 it was a way to throw her a party, but from a safe distance.\n\nPeople keep asking her \u2013 and her friends and family \u2013 what the secret is to her longevity. Is it all that dancing? Or just good Italian genes? Is it the fresh northern California air, or the proximity to the region\u2019s towering, ancient redwoods?\n\nHer usual response: \u201ctwo fingers of red wine\u201d and minding her own business.\n\nThe world\u2019s oldest person \u2013 Mar\u00eda Branyas Morera \u2013 has said much the same. Branyas, who lives in Spain but was also born in California, wrote in a tweet last year that her secret was \u201corder, tranquillity, good connection with family and friends\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve kind of adapted that too,\u201d said Taylor Day, 29, one of Ceccarelli\u2019s youngest relatives. \u201cA glass of red wine, and happiness.\u201d\n\n"}

But AI regulation is a rapidly evolving, contested policy space in which there\u2019s little agreement over what a good outcome would look like, let alone the best methods to get there. And being the third most important hub of AI research in the world doesn\u2019t give you an awful lot of power when the first two are the US and China.\n\nHow to slice through this Gordian knot? Simple: move swiftly and decisively to do \u2026 absolutely nothing.\n\nThe British government took the next step towards its AI regulation bill today. From our story:\n\nThe government will acknowledge on Tuesday that binding measures for overseeing cutting-edge AI development are needed at some point \u2013 but not immediately. Instead, ministers will set out \u201cinitial thinking for future binding requirements\u201d for advanced systems and discuss them with technical, legal and civil society experts. The government will also give \u00a310m to regulators to help them tackle AI risks, as well as requiring them to set out their approach to the technology by 30 April.\n\nWhen the first draft of the AI white paper was released, in March 2023, reaction was dismissive. The government\u2019s proposals dropped on the same day as the now-notorious call for a six-month \u201cpause\u201d in AI research to control the risk of out-of-control systems. Against that background, the white paper seemed pitiful.\n\nThe proposal was to give regulators no new powers at all, nor to hand any individual body the responsibility for guiding AI development. Instead, the government planned to coordinate existing regulators such as the Competition and Markets Authority and the Health and Safety Executive, offering five principles to guide the regulatory framework when they think about AI.\n\nThis approach was criticised for having \u201csignificant gaps\u201d by the Ada Lovelace Institute, the UK\u2019s leading AI research group, even ignoring the fact that a years-long legislative process would leave AI unregulated in the interim period.\n\nSo what\u2019s changed? Well, the government has found a truly whopping \u00a310m to hand to regulators to \u201cupskill\u201d them, and it has set a deadline of 30 April for the biggest to publish their AI plans. \u201cThe UK government will not rush to legislate, or risk implementing \u2018quick-fix\u2019 rules that would soon become outdated or ineffective,\u201d a Department for Science, Innovation and Technology spokesperson said.\n\nIt is an odd definition of \u201cglobal AI leadership\u201d, where being the quickest to say \u201cwe\u2019re not doing anything\u201d counts. The government is also \u201cthinking\u201d about real regulations, positing \u201cfuture binding requirements, which could be introduced for developers building the most advanced AI systems\u201d.\n\nA second, slightly larger, pot of money will launch \u201cnine new research hubs across the UK\u201d funded by \u201cnearly\u201d \u00a390m. The government also announced \u00a32m of funding to support \u201cnew research projects that will help to define what responsible AI looks like\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s a tragicomic element to reading a government press release that triumphantly discloses \u00a32m of funding just a week after Yoshua Bengio, one of the three \u201cgodfathers\u201d of AI, urged Canada to spend $1bn building a publicly owned supercomputer to keep up with the technology giants. It\u2019s like bringing a spoon to a knife fight.\n\nYou can call it staying nimble in the face of conflicting demands, but after a while \u2013 11 months and counting \u2013 it just looks like an inability to commit. The day before the latest updates to the AI white paper were announced, the Financial Times broke the news that a different pillar of AI regulation had collapsed. From its story (\u00a3):\n\nThe Intellectual Property Office, the UK government\u2019s agency overseeing copyright laws, has been consulting with AI companies and rights holders to produce guidance on text and data mining, where AI models are trained on existing materials such as books and music. However, the group of industry executives convened by the IPO that oversees the work has been unable to agree on a voluntary code of practice, meaning that it has returned the responsibility back to officials at the Department for Science Innovation and Technology.\n\nUnlike broader AI regulation \u2013 where there\u2019s a morass of conflicting opinions and some very vague long-term goals \u2013 copyright reform is quite a clean trade-off. On the one hand, creative and media businesses who own valuable intellectual property; on the other, technology firms who can use that IP to build valuable AI tools. One or the other group is going to be irritated by the outcome; a perfect compromise would merely mean both are.\n\nLast month, the boss of Getty Images was one of many calling on the UK to back its creative industries, one-tenth of the British economy, over the theoretical benefits that AI might bring in the future. And so, faced with a hard choice to make and no right answer, the government chose to do nothing. That way, it can\u2019t lead the world in the wrong direction. And isn\u2019t that what leadership is all about?\n\nDeeply fake\n\nView image in fullscreen Joe Biden poses for smartphone shots on the campaign trail. The US president was the subject of a fake video posted on Facebook. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP\n\nTo be fair to the government, there are obvious problems with moving too fast. To see some of them, let\u2019s look at social media. Facebook\u2019s rules don\u2019t ban deepfake videos of Joe Biden, its oversight board (AKA its \u201csupreme court\u201d), has found. But it\u2019s honestly not clear what they do ban, which is going to be an increasing problem.

The board, which is funded by Meta \u2013 Facebook\u2019s parent company \u2013 but run independently, took on the Biden video case in October in response to a user complaint about an altered seven-second video of the president.\n\nFacebook rushed out a policy on \u201cmanipulated media\u201d amid growing interest in deepfakes a few years ago, before ChatGPT and large language models became the AI fad du jour. The rules barred misleadingly altered videos made by AI.\n\nThe problem, the oversight board notes, is that it is an impossible policy to apply, with little obvious rationale behind it and no clear theory of harm it seeks to prevent. How is a moderator supposed to distinguish between a video made by AI, which is banned, and a video made by a skilled video editor, which is allowed? Even if they can distinguish them, why is only the former problematic enough to remove from the site?\n\nThe oversight board suggested updating the rules to remove the faddish reference to AI entirely, instead requiring labels identifying audio and video content as manipulated, regardless of the manipulation technique. Meta said it would update the policy.\n\nAge-appropriate social media\n\nView image in fullscreen Brianna Ghey, whose mother is calling for more limits to smartphones and social media. Photograph: Family handout/Cheshire Police/PA\n\nIn the wake of her daughter\u2019s murder by two classmates, the mother of Brianna Ghey has called for a revolution in how we approach teenage use of social media. Under 16s, she says, should be limited to using devices built for teens, which can be easily monitored by parents, with the full spectrum of tech-enabled living age-gated by the government or tech companies.\n\nI spoke Archie Bland, editor of our daily newsletter First Edition, about her pleas:\n\nThat lament will resonate with many parents, but has specific power in Brianna\u2019s case. She had \u201csecretly accessed pro-anorexia and self-harm sites on her smartphone\u201d, a petition created by Esther says. And prosecutors said that her killers had used Google to search for poisons, \u201cserial killer facts\u201d and ways to combat anxiety, as well as looking for rope on Amazon. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you need new software to do everything that Esther Ghey is asking for,\u201d Alex Hern said. \u201cBut there is a broader issue here \u2013 in the same way that this field has historically moved faster than governments have been able to keep up with, it\u2019s also moved faster than parents can keep up with. It is different with every app, it changes on a regular basis, and it is a large and difficult job to keep on top of.\u201d\n\nYou can read Archie\u2019s whole email here (and do also sign up here to get First Edition every weekday morning)."}

This is very serious stuff.\n\nOver in Smash Hits, Tom Hibbert\u2019s first question for the singer is: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Moz\u2019s persistent lethargy, Hibbert suggests, may be down to the vegetarian\u2019s \u201cdaily intake of yoghurt and bread\u201d. He grills him on whether his heroes ate meat and what he feeds his cat, and concludes by asking, \u201cIf you died tomorrow, went up to heaven and met Colonel Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken fame, what would you say to him?\u201d Morrissey suggests a knee in the groin. Hibbert points out that it is a trick question: \u201cYou should have said Colonel Sanders wouldn\u2019t be in heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\nThis single-issue Q&A is an immaculate example of the Hibbert approach. At Smash Hits and then Q magazine in the 80s and 90s, he deflated pomposity with religious adherence to the facts and wielded absurdism to discern whether stars recognised their ridiculous good fortune. Apparently banal questions turned out to be dangerously revealing: what colour was Tuesday? Sometimes he asked no questions at all, sitting back and smoking as his interviewees squirmed and ended up blabbing. His more descriptive pieces cultivated a conspiratorial lexicon that put PG Wodehouse and Geoffrey Willans\u2019 Molesworth through a filter of psychedelic fancy, yet they were grounded by his exacting eye. And much of this took place in what was ostensibly a teen pop magazine, creating a generation of his \u201cdear readers\u201d who were thrilled at being taken seriously by a writer who took pop seriously by loving it at its least serious.\n\nWithout Hibbert, there might have been no Popworld, no Popjustice, no Guardian Guide (RIP), although his ability to pierce delusions of grandeur may have hastened the PR-led clampdown that made celebrity journalism a lot less fun once he was done with it. (Ringo Starr flounced out of one insufficiently respectful Hibbert interview, indignant that \u201cthis is an actual bloody legend in front of you\u201d). Almost 13 years after his death at the age of 59, his influence remains rife. \u201cI was listening to the Today programme the other day,\u201d says friend, colleague and Q co-founder Mark Ellen. \u201cAmol Rajan was describing some political story and said, \u2018\u2026 and it all went horribly wrong!\u2019, which is a Tom Hibbert phrase!\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Pet Shop Boys on the cover of Smash Hits in 1986. Photograph: Smash Hits\n\nA new book, Phew, Eh Readers?, collects Hibbert\u2019s writings, from early essays about his love of the Byrds to the letters he made up at New Music News, a short-lived magazine that emerged when NME and Melody Maker were on strike in 1980, through the pop periodicals and into his cod-curmudgeonly broadsheet columns. It also includes essays about Hibbert written by friends and colleagues. Nine Eight Books publisher Pete Selby was a devout Smash Hits reader from 1981, \u201cso when Tom joined a few years later and \u2019ver Hits \u2013 as they called it \u2013 \u201centered its imperial phase\u201d \u2013 as erstwhile deputy editor Neil Tennant would later term the Pet Stop Boys\u2019 unstoppable period \u2013 \u201cI was absolutely primed for his idiosyncratic take on all that I held dear,\u201d he says.\n\nNeil Tennant, then deputy editor of the magazine (and soon to be of the Pet Shop Boys) gave Hibbert his in. Hibbert had joined New Music News after stints at DIY magazines and failing to make it as a musician. He had also published the excellent and self-explanatory book Rare Records in 1982. Ellen also worked at New Music News, but left for Smash Hits when the stopgap title was floundering. He asked Hibbert to submit some reviews. Tennant found them \u201cand said, \u2018Who wrote these? They\u2019re incredibly funny\u2019,\u201d says Ellen. \u201cThere was a review of a Genesis single done as a play, where three incredibly boring blokes with very expensive hi-fi equipment were talking about their tweeters and woofers. Their way of trying them out was by playing the new single by Genesis. It was so clever.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Groo! \u2026 a detail from the Black Type tea towel. Photograph: Nadia Shireen\n\nSmash Hits already had its own voice, but on getting hired in 1983, Hibbert \u201cbrought it to its full fruition\u201d, says Tennant. \u201cHe really brought the bonkers to Smash Hits, in a kind of baroque way.\u201d Past-it pop stars went to \u201cthe dumper\u201d, booze was \u201csauce\u201d or \u201crock\u2019n\u2019roll mouthwash\u201d; inverted commas equalled irony and the letters page was run by a Hibbert-ghosted entity known as Black Type, who \u201ccame down at night when everyone had left\u201d, says Ellen. \u201cIts mother was a bottle of Tipp-Ex and its father was a visual display unit. It answered the letters with these flippant comments that got more and more psychedelic.\u201d (The fortnight\u2019s prize letter won a Black Type tea towel, and the notion that a preteen reader would have any business with a tea towel seems in itself very Hibbert.)\n\nEllen recognised the roots of Hibbert\u2019s worldview when his father \u2013 celebrated historian Christopher Hibbert \u2013 visited Tom\u2019s garden in Fulham and asked, \u201c\u2018How do you get the flowers looking so lovely?\u2019 Tom says, \u2018Well, requires a bit of fertiliser and a bit of watering, TLC.\u2019\n\n\u201cThey were all plastic daffodils. I loved the idea that they\u2019ve grown up in this world where they invented these complete fantasies.\u201d\n\nWhile Hibbert was famously inventive, his Hits colleague Chris Heath makes clear that \u201cwe were so rigorous about things being true. It\u2019s people\u2019s perception of what they see as things written for a teenage audience, that you\u2019re just playing fast and loose and nothing really matters. We wanted to be able to see the absurdity and the lack of seriousness in everything, and simultaneously take everything more seriously than you could possibly take it.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018It got more and more psychedelic\u2019 \u2026 (L-R) Mark Ellen and Tom Hibbert, London, mid-90s.

Just meeting Hibbert was \u201cserious hero stuff\u201d, she says. Together they sparkled up the news in the Bitz front section, though Hibbert kept his head down. \u201cHe just worked all day. And he was very much amused by his own jokes, as I think great comic writers should be. It was glorious to see what he would come up with because he was never writing to anyone\u2019s brief.\u201d That \u201ctotal creative freedom\u201d rubbed off on Patterson (who has made the drying plains of music journalism a much funnier place for nearly 40 years). \u201cHe gave everyone the courage to go out and find your voice. There were no rules. I took that spirit with me, always.\u201d\n\nSo did readers. In the late 80s, nine-year-old Nadia Shireen was living in Bristol, \u201cat the height of my Smash Hits mania\u201d, having been indoctrinated by her older brother. \u201cWe wrote letters to each other that were entirely in Smash Hits-ese,\u201d she says. \u201cWe even made a fanzine about our family written in it. It\u2019s hilarious, imagining these brown kids writing to each other in weird cod-Wodehouse language.\u201d From 2002 to 2004, she worked on production at Smash Hits, still keen to follow in Hibbert and Patterson\u2019s footsteps despite the mag\u2019s diminished form. Today Shireen is an acclaimed children\u2019s author and illustrator and Hibbert\u2019s influence still creeps in. In 2016\u2019s The Bumblebear, some bees are shocked that their outsized new bee friend is actually a bear in disguise. \u201cThey go, \u2018What the jiggins!\u2019 Kids love that line. And I was flicking through my back issues of Smash Hits and there was a feature with the headline: \u2018What the jiggins is Morrissey going on about now?\u2019 I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d stolen it wholesale.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen No match for his waffle-detector \u2026 Tom Hibbert with Margaret Thatcher in 1987. Photograph: Paul Rider\n\nSuch was Hibbert\u2019s reach that in 1987 (wearing a rented suit), he interviewed Margaret Thatcher for Smash Hits, her people being keen to have \u201cyou, the youth of the nation, batting on her team\u201d, as Hibbert wrote \u2013 in other words, the magazine\u2019s 800,000 readers. Her evasiveness was no match for his waffle detector. Her florid answers were peppered with the classic Hits \u201c(???\u2013Ed)\u201d, and her disconnection from young people became brutally apparent.\n\nBut Hibbert, he later said, was \u201creally fed up\u201d at Smash Hits, and accepted Ellen and David Hepworth\u2019s invitation to join the nascent Q magazine around 1987. While Q\u2019s tone was \u201cbroadly enthusiastic\u201d, says Ellen, they needed \u201ca little bit of fibre\u201d, and so coined the regular Who the Hell? (as in, Who the Hell Does John Lydon Think He Is?) profile for Hibbert to probe the era\u2019s less self-aware stars.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Sleeve Notes Free weekly newsletter Get music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

His lightness of touch is beautiful: when Status Quo disparage women, gay men and Italians, he simply writes: \u201cThey are not very ideologically sound, the Quo, are they, readers?\u201d (However, Hibbert\u2019s grimly prescient 1990 Q profile of Jimmy Savile, in which he asks about the \u201crumour that Savile is rather fascinated with dead bodies\u201d and is told \u201cI\u2019m not a necrophiliac\u201d, was not included in the new book so as not to overshadow it, says editor Jasper Murison-Bowie.)\n\nQ got away with these executions by telling PRs their charges were sitting for a regular interview by another writer, then subbing Hibbert at the last minute. He was \u201cfearless\u201d, says Tennant, who admits that \u201cfor years\u201d, the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 PR would say, \u201c\u2018Q want to interview you\u2019, and we\u2019d say, \u2018It\u2019s not Who the Hell?, is it?\u2019 I thought we were crying out for it, really.\u201d\n\nAfter Q, Hibbert wrote an offbeat music column for the Mail on Sunday, and an even stranger one for the Observer documenting his ill-fated run for the defunct Whig party. But in 1997, he was hospitalised with pneumonia and acute pancreatitis and spent four months in an induced coma. Afterwards, \u201che never sprung back again\u201d, his widow Allyce Hibbert writes. After three years, she moved to Hong Kong, in despair at Hibbert\u2019s refusal to get better. He never worked again and died in 2011. \u201cIt was so horrible,\u201d Allyce writes. \u201cSuddenly everything came flooding back. But then I could start liking him again, because I didn\u2019t have to deal with the reality of him.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the 90s, Hibbert\u2019s influence was waning. The Smash Hits I grew up reading was a gaudy kids\u2019 mag, and closed in 2006. Pop was becoming more manufactured and PR companies more controlling. Intentionally combative broadsheet interviews lacked Hibbert\u2019s anticipation \u2013 although often defeated \u2013 of the world\u2019s \u201cwondrous potential\u201d, as Heath puts it.\n\nPeter Robinson\u2019s irreverent pop website Popjustice, founded in 2000, was a rare exception, influenced, he says, \u201cby a frustration that the pop press were saying all pop music was brilliant and the \u2018serious\u2019 music press said all pop music was rubbish, so each side lacked credibility.\u201d It had a kindred spirit in the anarchic Stool Pigeon newspaper and in Channel 4\u2019s Popworld \u2013 in which an interview might naturally be conducted with loudhailers across a car park \u2013 although that also ended in 2007, once its healthily disrespectful approach repelled star names.\n\nView image in fullscreen Kindred spirits \u2026 Simon Amstell and Miquita Oliver on Popworld. Photograph: Channel 4 Picture Publicity\n\nToday, increasingly rare interviews with pop superstars are often so hagiographic that you wonder about the terms of engagement. Michael Cragg, author of Reach for the Stars, an oral history of British pop from 1996 to 2006, says that the balance of power has tipped in the stars\u2019 favour, especially as social media mean that they can speak to fans directly. Plus, \u201cpeople are asking much more serious questions now and pop stars are expected to say much more serious things about serious topics\u201d \u2013 a curdling of the poptimist ideal that pop is as worthy of sincere admiration as rock.\n\nAnd if the 80s were a time of relative innocence about the newly MTV-minted state of pop superstardom, today, awareness of mental health and industry abuse might make the mockery of some pop stars sit awkwardly. And where would anyone do it? The disappearance of pop magazines took with it the scope to fit irreverent supporting features alongside the beefy stuff, as well as the newsroom camaraderie that enticed readers. At a time when Cond\u00e9 Nast has fired Pitchfork\u2019s long-serving features and editorial staff, \u201cit feels pertinent to point out in 2024 that a really easy way to ensure a coherent tone of voice that\u2019s specific to your publication is to pay full-time music journalists whose focus is on making this one publication as good as it can be,\u201d says Robinson, who now works as a therapist and in media training.\n\nView image in fullscreen Paul (and Linda) McCartney\u2019s lovely horses, 1973. Photograph: David Dagley/Shutterstock\n\nToday, there remain Hibbert torchbearers: Heath edits the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 annual, Annually (obviously), which brims with excellent trivia. One recent reader question asked whether Tennant and Chris Lowe have ever ridden a horse: Tennant: no; Lowe: one donkey, and not just any horse but Paul McCartney\u2019s horse. The next issue, Heath teases, includes a bit on whether they don socks or pants first \u2013 fundamentally useless information that surely improves the gaiety of nations. Cragg\u2019s Reach for the Stars revels in the minutiae of a shiny pop era that many wouldn\u2019t consider worthy of close consideration. Shireen has sold two Ellen-authorised reproductions of the Black Type tea towel, the second to raise money for the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing. Until I read a previous collection of Who the Hell? features 12 years ago, I hadn\u2019t realised how much Hibbert-ese I had inherited through the chatter of older friends. And it is universally accepted that inverted commas equal irony.\n\nHeath says he was pleased to hear of this new Hibbert collection, \u201cbecause I think he is the kind of voice that gets much more easily forgotten \u2013 people who write very sober, analytical analyses of pop culture tend to get more easily celebrated. That era of Smash Hits is often celebrated as 80s nostalgia, but as a way of advancing a way to talk about culture, celebrity and the world, I think it was a landmark and influential.\u201d He says how \u201cprivileged\u201d he was to have started there, around \u201csuch switched-on, clever, brilliant people doing something so interesting, on the one hand in a scattershot and crazed way, but actually in a really careful, intelligent, thoughtful way.\u201d\n\nAs Hibbert once wrote of his beloved Alex Chilton: \u201cHeroes are growing thin on the ground.\u201d"}

He is now staying with extended family in Gaza in a home subject to heavy bombardment.\n\nHis parents were visiting their two older sons in the UK on 7 October, one who arrived in the UK on a scholarship and now has a work visa and another who is a British national astrophysicist, who also arrived in the UK on a scholarship.\n\nTheir younger 18-year-old son did not travel with them as he was starting his first year of university in Gaza. He is emotionally, financially and practically dependent on his parents.\n\n\u201cThis situation is extremely grave,\u201d his eldest brother said. \u201cIt\u2019s a ticking timebomb \u2013 he could be killed at any point. The toll on my parents is indescribable. My mother has Parkinson\u2019s, the tremors have worsened now and it is spreading to other parts of her body. Every day, the probability he will be killed gets higher and higher. The anxiety is literally killing my mother, while my brother is alone, desperate and abandoned.\u201d\n\nIn December, the teenager made an urgent entry clearance application to the Home Office based on article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which relies on his right to family life, but the Home Office refused, stating that he had not submitted his biometrics at a visa application centre (VAC) in Gaza, or crossed the border to reach a VAC in Egypt. All VACs were, and remain, closed in Gaza.\n\nThe man\u2019s brother contacted the FCDO directly to include him on the UK\u2019s evacuation list, but they also refused to assist, arguing that he does not meet the criteria as he does not have a UK visa for six months or more, or a spouse or child under 18 living in the UK.\n\n\u201cWhy is bureaucracy \u2013 why are these technicalities \u2013 being used as an excuse not to help vulnerable people like my brother, who have vulnerable parents already in the UK?\u201d his eldest brother said.\n\n\u201cWhen this government wants to manage a situation, they have ways to practise discretion in a bold manner. Instead, they are just putting sticks in the wheel so we can\u2019t move forward.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday the teenager\u2019s legal representatives will argue that he had made previous successful entry clearance applications to visit his brothers in the UK alongside his parents, and had provided biometrics as recently as August 2022.\n\nThe Home Office has the power to exercise discretion to consider his application without biometrics. If the Home Office grants his application by way of pre-determination \u2013 a decision before providing biometrics \u2013 the man\u2019s chances of evacuation would be greatly increased. He would then be able to provide fresh biometrics at a VAC in Egypt before onward travel to the UK.\n\nAnother option is that the FCDO could put forward his details to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities to be included on the evacuation list.\n\nRoopa Tanna, the solicitor acting on the man\u2019s behalf said: \u201cMy client is an 18-year-old who is separated from his parents and closest family at a time when what matters most is for families to be united. His life as at risk and his parents fear losing their son forever if this matter is not swiftly resolved. In my view, he has a very strong case for entry clearance in accordance with the right to family life and in accordance with the immigration rules.\u201d\n\nPalestinians have been petitioning the UK government for safe passage for their family members to join them, but the government has consistently said that there \u201care no plans to introduce bespoke arrangements for people arriving from the region. Those wishing to come to the UK who currently have no visa can apply under one of the existing visa routes.\u201d\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cAll applications are carefully considered on their individual merits, and must meet the requirements of the immigration rules and published guidance.\u201d"}

The ship continued on its way.\n\nThe United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations agency said just after midnight GMT on Tuesday that it had received a report of a projectile fired at the port side of a ship west of Hodeidah and that a small craft was seen nearby.\n\nThe projectile passed over the deck and caused slight damage to the bridge windows, but the vessel and crew were safe and proceeded on the planned passage, it added.\n\nSaree said operations against vessels would continue until \u201cthe aggression against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped\u201d.\n\nOn Monday the UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, told MPs there had been a change in the cadence of Houthi strikes. \u201cThe clock is running down for the Houthis, in as much as their ability is being degraded,\u201d Shapps said. \u201cThey do not have the eyes and ears from the radar stations; they are more reliant still on Iran.\u201d\n\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is on his fifth trip to the Middle East since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. He travelled to Egypt after meeting Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, in Riyadh to discuss how to achieve \u201can enduring end to the crisis in Gaza\u201d.\n\nBlinken is also due to travel to Qatar, Israel and the West Bank. His efforts will largely turn on the response Hamas finally gives to a framework for a ceasefire deal, which would involve the exchange of more than 100 Israeli hostages held in Gaza in return for a lengthy pause in fighting and the release of Palestinians detained in Israeli jails. Hamas has said it wants a permanent ceasefire and the removal of all Israeli troops from Gaza, something the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is not prepared to offer.\n\nThe price for the US not securing a lengthy ceasefire is rising as it finds itself embroiled in fighting directly against Iranian-backed forces in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. It is not clear how US strategic interests in any of these three countries are being advanced by the military confrontation. In Iraq, political forces calling for US bases to be closed down have grown stronger as a result of US strikes on Iranian-backed militia inside the country. In Syria, the US-backed Kurdish forces that have formed the linchpin of the US drive against Islamic State suffered a serious blow on Monday when they lost six fighters to a drone strike.\n\nIn Yemen, the UN-recognised government in Aden has sacked its prime minister, replacing him with the hardline anti-Houthi foreign minister Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak. Hugely experienced, Mubarak is sceptical of plans by Saudi Arabia to strike a peace deal with the Houthis to formally bring Yemen\u2019s civil war to a close. Last Thursday he said Iran\u2019s al-Quds force operatives had been deployed to Yemen\u2019s coastline.\n\nThe reshuffle will reflect concerns in the US about the quality of the anti-Houthi alliance in the country. The prime minister is overseen by a disparate eight-strong presidential leadership council, some of whom are backed by Saudi Arabia and others by the United Arab Emirates."}

Behind those cases, of course, there\u2019s an unknown number of women who were investigated but cleared, so their phones were seized, they were prevented from contact with their children, they were questioned under caution with the possibility of life imprisonment when they\u2019d just had a miscarriage. All these women lived, if not their worst, then surely their most medieval, nightmare, and some are living it as we speak.\n\nThe natural question was: what the hell was going on? Had the police lost their minds? (When the Guardian asked one force about its actions last year, it chose to lie about them, which surprised me.) Was the director of public prosecutions anti-abortion? (Max Hill KC declined to comment.) Had medics suffered some kind of group amnesia around patient confidentiality? (The police generally become involved only when they\u2019re alerted by a doctor or midwife.) All that is still possible, but when I spoke to the campaign organisation Doctors for Choice, it exhibited the kind of pragmatism you look for in a doctor. Never mind the finger-pointing \u2013 change the law. Abortion should not be in the criminal code at all. Life imprisonment is the harshest penalty for illegal abortion in the world, which gives England and Wales the dubious distinction of being more severe than Syria, Poland, Texas and South Sudan.\n\nDoctors, midwives, nurses and students are launching a campaign this week \u2013 a protest outside the Old Bailey, posters on buses \u2013 in support of an amendment to the criminal justice bill that will come to a vote at the end of the month. And again, you\u2019ve got to hand it to medics for driving this: between their pay degradation, the student debt overhang, the bizarre hostility from government ministers and the crazy hours, you\u2019d think they\u2019d have enough on their plate.\n\nAbortion law in much of the UK is an arcane fix left over from 1967, which you maybe don\u2019t think seriously about until you\u2019re seeking an abortion. Given that one in three British women will at some point, that\u2019s quite a lot of people who\u2019ve been in this objectively comical position: you have to get two doctors to sign off on the fact that the pregnancy represents a grave, permanent threat to your mental health. Theoretically, you have to pretend to be crazy, and they have to pretend to believe you, in order to enact what will plausibly, besides dropping geography at GCSE, be the sanest decision of your life. I remember being genuinely unclear about what this situation would require: would a simple \u201cyes\u201d to the imperilled mental health question suffice, or would I also need to rend my garments and make nervous breakdown noises?\n\nJust a \u201cyes\u201d was fine, but plainly the law was infantilising, removing my agency and delivering it to two doctors who didn\u2019t want it. Equally plainly, who cared? It was the late 20th century, when all arcs tended to justice and legal anomalies were just boring parliamentary debates that hadn\u2019t been had yet. The magnificent gynaecologist and campaigner Wendy Savage used to sometimes tell us on panels to wise up and fight a bit harder. But by and large, we stayed pretty polite about it. And now it\u2019s 30 years later, and she\u2019s 88, and she\u2019ll be speaking on this week\u2019s protest, and \u2013 without wishing to put words in her mouth \u2013 I imagine she\u2019ll be saying a more elegant version of, \u201cHoly shit, you lot \u2013 the arc is all over the place, and now you really need to wise up and fight a bit harder.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t wait to find out who\u2019s driving these prosecutions; don\u2019t wait until the first conviction is landed using period tracker data; don\u2019t wait to see whether the US, in rolling back reproductive rights, was an outlier or a harbinger: fight for decriminalisation now, because staying polite has got us precisely nowhere."}

But fully repealing the IRA, which has disproportionally brought popular funding and jobs in solar, wind and battery manufacturing to Republican districts, may be politically difficult for Trump even if his party gains full control of Congress.\n\nHowever, Trump could still slow down the progress of the clean energy transition as president by redrawing the rules for the IRA\u2019s generous tax credits.\n\nHe would, his allies say, also scrap government considerations of the damage caused by carbon emissions; compel a diminished EPA to squash pollution rules for cars, trucks and power plants; and symbolically nullify the Paris climate agreement by not only withdrawing the US again but sending it to the Senate for ratification as a treaty, knowing it would fail.\n\n\u201cThe Paris climate accord does nothing to actually improve the environment here in the United States or globally,\u201d said Mandy Gunasekara, Trump\u2019s former EPA chief of staff. She argued that the agreement puts too little pressure on China, India and other developing countries to reduce their emissions.\n\nIn recent rallies, Trump, the likely Republican nominee, has called renewable energy \u201ca scam business\u201d and vowed to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d. On his first day in office, Trump has said he would repeal \u201ccrooked Joe Biden\u2019s insane electric vehicle mandate\u201d and approve a glut of new gas export terminals currently paused by Biden.\n\nView image in fullscreen Mandy Gunasekara, former chief of staff for the EPA, speaks at a bitcoin conference in Houston in 2022. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAreas currently off-limits for drilling, such the Arctic, will also probably be opened up to industry by Trump. \u201cI will end his war on American energy,\u201d Trump has said of the incumbent president, even though in reality the US hit record levels of oil and gas production last year.\n\n\u201cI expect the Republicans will put together their own very aggressive reconciliation bill to claw back the subsidies in the IRA,\u201d said Tom Pyle, president of the free market American Energy Alliance and previous head of the US Department of Energy\u2019s transition team under Trump.\n\n\u201cThe president will benefit from having the experience of being in office before, he\u2019ll get a faster head start on his agenda. He won\u2019t be encumbered by the need to be re-elected, so there will be a short window of time but he may be more aggressive as a result.\u201d\n\n\u2018There is no logic to it\u2019\n\nCritics of Trump, who are already fretting over his potential return to the White House, warn this agenda will stymie clean energy investment, place Americans\u2019 health at the mercy of polluters, badly damage the effort to address the climate crisis and alienate America\u2019s allies.\n\n\u201cA return of Trump would be, in a word, horrific,\u201d said Andrew Rosenberg, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration official, now fellow at the University of New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cIt would also be incredibly stupid. It would roll back progress made over decades to protect public health and safety, there is no logic to it other than to destroy everything. People who support him may not realize it\u2019s their lives at stake, too.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Joe Biden arrives at a wind power facility in Pueblo, Colorado, on 29 November 2023. Photograph: Daniel Brenner/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nA second Trump term would be more ideologically extreme than the first, with fewer restraints, Rosenberg claimed. \u201cThere were people part of a reasonable mainstream in his first term who buffered against his craziest instincts \u2013 they won\u2019t be there any more,\u201d he said.\n\nShould Trump manage to repeal the IRA and water down or scrap EPA pollution rules, there would be severe consequences for a world that is struggling to contain an escalating climate crisis, experts say.\n\nThe US, the world\u2019s second biggest carbon polluter, would still see its emissions drop under Trump due to previous policies and a market-led shift away from coal to gas as an energy source, but at only half the rate of a second Biden term, according to an analysis by Energy Innovation shared with the Guardian.\n\nThis would deal a mortal blow to the global effort to restrain dangerous global heating, with scientists warning that the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half this decade, and eliminate them entirely by 2050, to avoid breaching agreed temperature limits and plunge billions of people into worsening heatwaves, floods and droughts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Donald Trump would actually be able to replace the IRA, but you couldn\u2019t rule it out,\u201d said Anand Gopal, executive director at Energy Innovation.\n\n\u201cIf he did, the global effect would be potentially disastrous. It would encourage everyone else to go backwards or slow down their climate pledges and put the world way off track to where it needs to be. It could prove the difference between staying under 1.5C warming or not.\u201d\n\nMuch will hinge upon any new Trump administration\u2019s ability to better navigate arcane regulatory procedures and the courts. His previous term saw an enormous number of legal defeats for his hurried attempts at environmental rollbacks, as well as the departure of scandal-plagued cabinet members overseeing this effort.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just snap your fingers,\u201d said Jeff Navin, a former chief of staff at the US Department of Energy. \u201cYou need to spend a lot of time redoing regulations. Is that something Trump really wants to do rather than just pursue other grievances? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Workers load coal at a US steel facility in Clairton, Pennsylvania, in September 2023. Photograph: Tom O\u2019Neill/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nBut some conservatives believe Trump will prove more successful second time around, pointing to an amenably conservative supreme court and more detailed planning ahead of the election, such as the Project 2025 document put out by the rightwing Heritage Foundation, which details severe cuts to the EPA and Department of the Interior, as well as a greater politicization of the civil service to push through Trumpian goals.\n\n\u201cWe are writing a battle plan, and we are marshaling our forces,\u201d Paul Dans, director of Project 2025, told E&E News last year. \u201cNever before has the whole conservative movement banded together to systematically prepare to take power day one and deconstruct the administrative state.\u201d\n\nJeff Holmstead, who ran the EPA\u2019s air office during George W Bush\u2019s administration, said Trump\u2019s administration would be \u201cmuch more prepared\u201d for a second term.\n\n\u201cThey know what they need to do to undo rules in a in a legally defensible way,\u201d he said. A new Trump administration would take a more \u201csurgical approach\u201d to deregulation, he said, taking more of its cues from industry.\n\nUnder Biden, Gunasekara said, there has been an \u201cunnecessary tension\u201d between the oil sector and regulators.\n\n\u201cYou have to work with the industry players,\u201d she said. \u201cAgencies should not be about suppressing or boosting particular technologies.\u201d\n\nEarly on, Trump officials will probably work with Congress to kill certain rules through a parliamentary procedure called the Congressional Review Act. The Clinton-era statute empowers Congress and the president to work together to overturn major federal regulations within 60 legislative days of finalization, by passing a joint resolution of disapproval signed by the president.\n\n\u201cGenerally in the past, anything that is finalized after mid- to late May is likely to be within that window,\u201d said Holmstead. \u201cSo speed is of the essence for the Biden administration.\u201d\n\nA fresh Trump term could engulf federal climate scientists, too, who were ignored but largely allowed to issue their work during Trump\u2019s last term. A new Trump White House could intervene more to alter climate reports, or even stage a previously mooted public debate on the merits of climate science.\n\nView image in fullscreen Climate protesters interrupt a Trump rally in Iowa on 14 January. Photograph: Christian Monterrosa/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\u201cI expect that idea will be revived and I think we would get a much wider view of climate science that wouldn\u2019t be controlled by a small cabal,\u201d said Ebell. \u201cThat will start very quickly.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s plans come as Biden has struggled to inspire younger, climate-conscious voters who have been angered by his ongoing leasing of public lands and waters to the fossil fuel industry, such as the controversial Willow oil project in Alaska.\n\nBiden has overseen a boom in liquified natural gas exports that he has belatedly attempted to restrain and his administration has floundered in its attempts to sell the IRA to the American public, with most voters unaware of the climate legislation or its significance in driving down emissions.\n\nStill, the president\u2019s position on climate change is incomparable to Trump\u2019s, according to Rosenberg. \u201cThe contrast is incredibly stark between Biden and Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I think Biden is the best of the best? Of course not. But compared to Trump? That\u2019s just scary.\n\n\u201cAnyone who cares about public health, the environment, science, international relations, you could go on, should be scared about another Trump presidency.\u201d"}

The whole point of the institution is to convey an image of resilience and invulnerability and to be seen in public, so King Charles\u2019s decision to announce his cancer diagnosis publicly is to be commended for its commitment to openness. Early indications from Buckingham Palace, doctors and Downing Street are that there is nothing to worry about and, as Rishi Sunak let slip this morning, the disease, whatever it is, has been caught early. The king is, after all, 75 years old, active and fit on two meals a day, but he is of an age when many men receive such a diagnosis.\n\nThe speculation will start now. It is 72 years to the day since a shocked and deferential British public woke up to the news that Charles\u2019s grandfather George VI had died in his sleep. Not even the king had apparently been told that, after a lifetime of heavy smoking, he had lung cancer \u2013 though perhaps the fact that his left lung had been removed in an operation at Buckingham Palace four and a half months earlier might have given him a bit of a clue. Those in the know, like the then prime minister, Winston Churchill, knew better, but no one else did, despite his haggard appearance. It could barely be disguised with makeup when he saw his daughter Princess Elizabeth off on a foreign tour from Heathrow a week before his death, the official cause of which was given as coronary thrombosis.\n\nCharles has robust genes (and doesn\u2019t smoke). The Queen was still undertaking royal duties 48 hours before her death aged 96, after 70 years on the throne, and his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, got to 99, but what are we to make of the king\u2019s recent health problems \u2013 first treatment for an enlarged prostate, and now this?\n\nWe should welcome Charles\u2019s insistence on openness and reassurance, though it is pretty partial. We do not know what sort of cancer it is, or what the treatment is likely to be; still less, and understandably, the prognosis. The palace\u2019s statement may have been to placate public concern about absences from public appearances, but of course it won\u2019t (and some at the palace would probably say that there would not have been any speculation at all if nothing had been said). In the days of social media, the gossip and rumours will be virulent and obsessive, so it is probable that confidentiality will not last long.\n\nAs the oldest king to accede to the throne, it has always been known that Charles\u2019s reign will be relatively short, but news of his cancer is bound to raise concerns. Who is going to take his place if he is incapacitated, or in decline? When the king talked of a slimmed-down monarchy, did he really mean there would not be enough royals to go round opening things, touring factories and travelling to the realms across the world? Is this the start of the end for a British head of state in Tuvalu, let alone Australia?\n\nSome questions are easier to answer than others. Does Prince Harry flying in to see his father signal a rapprochement? Answer: probably not. Will Prince Andrew be allowed back into the public realm to help out? Definitely not.\n\nWhat about his duties? Last year there were overseas tours and more than 500 public engagements, plus the daily round of red boxes of official papers from the government and private meetings, such as those weekly briefings with the prime minister. Charles has already said he will step back from public duties during his treatment, so who will take up the work? It is going to be a busy year politically. For decades we never had to deal with these questions, as Queen Elizabeth II was always there in blooming health, but now we must.\n\nEvery official photograph will now be scrutinised for signs of physical weakness, or changing appearance. Is he losing weight, has he lost hair? Will hebe able to be the kind of monarch Britain had expected? Will the short reign that has long been expected prove to be much shorter than anticipated?\n\nThese may be heartless and intrusive questions \u2013 and they may be made redundant by a rapid return to apparent health \u2013 but they will hover prominently in the background. Like every monarch since William the Conqueror, kings have to be seen to be believed. Now that the monarch has opted for openness, can the flow of information be contained?"}

Universities are buzzing with rumours about institutions that might be about to go bust, or at the very least scrap the course your child\u2019s heart was set upon. Students mainly worry about money \u2013 to the point where the NUS found one in 10 were using food banks \u2013 as do parents forced to top up maintenance loans that barely cover the rent.\n\nMeanwhile, academics puzzle over the growing number of students who seem to be skipping lectures. Is it because they are taking part-time jobs on the side to pay the rent, or are too many kids, whose hearts aren\u2019t really in it, obediently ploughing through something they\u2019ve been told is their only route to a decent job?\n\nThese are all perfectly reasonable questions that absolutely nobody is answering because public debate about higher education still revolves obsessively around culture wars on campus, spats about private school kids getting into Oxbridge, and a dangerously misleading row currently being whipped up over foreign students supposedly taking places from British teenagers. Never mind that if every foreign student declined their place tomorrow, the net result would probably be a damn sight fewer places available for British kids, given the number of universities that would collapse overnight without the overseas fees that are currently plugging a black hole in state funding.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to take my word for that: judging by the sudden fall in overseas student numbers some universities have experienced following a government crackdown on visas, we might now find out in real time what happens when young people stop wanting to pay over the odds to study in a country that is loudly hostile to their presence.\n\nThe first thing that evidently happens is universities call your bluff and openly demand a rise in tuition fees, as Universities UK\u2019s Vivienne Stern did at the weekend. The real reason they\u2019ve been frozen since 2017 is that it has thoroughly suited successive governments not to take a political hit from raising them: the mirthless joke among special advisers used to be that higher education was the one public service whose recipients actually thanked you for cutting its funding, with students and parents relieved every time fees didn\u2019t go up. What they didn\u2019t realise was that to compensate for dwindling fee income \u2013 now worth in real terms roughly what it was 14 years ago, and nowhere near enough to cover the real cost of teaching \u2013 universities would hike rents in halls of residence to sometimes painful levels and hold academic pay down to the point that strikes became inevitable, with miserable consequences for students.\n\nRecruiting overseas probably felt to vice-chancellors like the least painful way of balancing the books, but now they have been thrown to the wolves for it by a government playing the oldest trick in the book of desperation: if something is in short supply \u2013 from council housing to well-paid jobs to university places \u2013 blame foreigners for having too much of it, rather than your own shortsighted failure to provide enough of it.\n\nYet so far this election year brings a deafening silence from both main political parties about fixing this increasingly urgent underlying problem. Keir Starmer has ditched Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s pledge to abolish tuition fees, but is yet to flesh out his promised \u201cfairer\u201d system for student funding. Meanwhile, Conservative education secretary Gillian Keegan, who left school at 16 for an apprenticeship herself, clearly wants to expand the number of careers teenagers can get into without going to university, including maths teaching, with a new \u201cearn and learn\u201d degree-level apprenticeship unveiled this week. But what is missing is a frank conversation about where this expansion leaves a presumably shrunken higher education sector.\n\nWill some universities just be allowed to go bang? Are we sliding back to the days when middle-class kids mostly went to university, and on into the really elite careers, while working-class kids mostly did not \u2013 only this time with parents paying upfront for that privilege? Perhaps the single biggest problem for British universities navigating this crisis is that nobody really wants to talk about the painful business of solving it."}

Anyone acquainted with the table manners of two- and three-year-olds may well be bracing themselves for carnage. Yet green beans are being happily pronged with forks rather than chucked on the floor and some faces don\u2019t even need a wipe. To underline this dining miracle: one little girl is wearing a white top that survives a tomato-based sauce.\n\nFor this remarkable scene we can thank the calming presence of Bill Wall, who sits in the middle drinking a cappuccino and gently encouraging the children to have a few more mouthfuls. This 87-year-old former electrician has become one of the children\u2019s \u201cgrandfriends\u201d \u2013 \u201cour Bill\u201d, they call him. Since he moved into the intergenerational community in Chester last year, he spends almost as much time down in the nursery as up in his care home suite.\n\nWall struggles to talk these days, but he does not need words to communicate with the children. One of his lunch companions is three-year-old Jacob Farrell-Ogunyemi, who is on his third helping of cassoulet. His mum, Maeve Farrell, a teacher, is delighted not just with Jacob\u2019s increasingly adventurous appetite but also the relationships he has formed with Bill and his other grandfriends. Farrell is from Northern Ireland and her partner is from London: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any family here. So I was mindful of Jacob missing out on that and how much you can learn from people of different ages.\u201d\n\nBelong Chester claims to be the first older people\u2019s \u201ccare setting\u201d in the UK to include a fully integrated children\u2019s research nursery, where children and residents come together every day. It opened last year in a purpose-built, five-storey complex in Chester city centre constructed of handsome red brick. The ground floor bistro and hairdressers are open to the public, with the care home element contained in six 12-person \u201chouseholds\u201d on the upper floors, along with 23 apartments available for older people to rent or buy.\n\nView image in fullscreen A calming presence \u2026 Bill Wall has lunch with toddlers from the nursery. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian\n\nIt is bright and cheery, the sort of place you\u2019d choose to have your lunch, even if it wasn\u2019t included in your nursery or nursing home fees. Many residents have dementia, but all have the opportunity to interact with the children on a daily basis, studied by academics from nine universities researching the physical and mental health benefits of intergenerational living.\n\nIf the idea is familiar to you, it is probably from the Channel 4 series, Old People\u2019s Home for 4 Year Olds. The show took inspiration from the intergenerational communities that started springing up in Japan in the 1970s, and brought together a group of preschoolers and the St Monica Trust retirement community in Bristol. Everybody loved the series, says Sue Egersdorff, co-founder of Ready Generations, the charity that operates Belong\u2019s nursery. But, she says, the multiple series of the show \u201chaven\u2019t done us any great service, because all they do is present all the lovely cutie bits\u201d. TV made it look too easy.\n\nEgersdorff is a little sniffy about rivals who claim to offer intergenerational living, yet only really bring together the generations for special occasions. \u201cLots of people say they do it, but perhaps the children come once a term, at Easter, Christmas or whenever,\u201d she says. She and her co-founder, Liz Ludden, had both been involved in other intergenerational projects \u201cwhich just didn\u2019t feel authentic\u201d, says Ludden. They were inevitably short-term: a local council would pay, say, for a six-week project to mix nursery children with care home residents that would leave everyone \u2013 young and old \u2013 sad and confused when it ended.\n\nBelong is different, insists Egersdorff. Though the children go home to their families every night, \u201cduring the day it\u2019s about actually living together. What we found since we opened last year is that the really special things don\u2019t necessarily happen in the planned stuff.\u201d It\u2019s the spontaneous moments \u201cwhere the magic, the real learning, happens\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018I was mindful of Jacob missing out on how much you can learn from people of different ages\u2019 \u2026 Jacob Farrell-Ogunyemi and Margaret Darby.

Residents are asked each day if they would welcome any young visitors and are never alone with the children. Those too unwell to go down to the nursery can send the children a note via a special red postbox in reception.\n\nAlan Hyde and his wife, Diana, both 82, often invite the children to their apartment to see their budgie, Joey. Diana is living with Alzheimer\u2019s, but has \u201calways loved children\u201d, says Alan. \u201cIf she\u2019s not having a good day I bring her down to the nursery and it\u2019s as if someone has turned her switch back on. It\u2019s that powerful.\u201d\n\nLoving and caring for someone with dementia can be tough, says Alan. But since moving into Belong, \u201cI\u2019ve got more friends than before. Not long ago I went back to the village where we used to live, to take Diana to the hairdressers, and they said: \u2018You\u2019re looking much happier now.\u2019\u201d It works both ways, says Ludden: \u201cThe children light up if they see Diana pass.\u201d Earlier this year Diana was in hospital after having a stroke and breaking her arm. Some of the children spotted Alan popping out to Waitrose alone. \u201cThey said to me: \u2018Alan, where\u2019s Diana?\u2019\u201d he recalls, clearly touched.\n\nThe underlying philosophy we have here is that we\u2019re trying to enable people to live happy, joyful lives Martin Rix, Belong chief executive\n\nMany of the nursery parents think their children have become more caring by mixing with older people. \u201cSome of them use a wheelchair, some have limited speech or communication, and I think it has made Jacob more empathic,\u201d says Farrell. \u201cI\u2019m six months pregnant and I\u2019ve been really ill, and when Jacob has seen me be unwell, he checks on me. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal for a three-year-old, but Belong is definitely teaching the children they have to be a little bit careful around their grandfriends. One of them had a fall and was bruised and Jacob was asking how she was.\u201d Amy Liu says her daughter, Charlotte, aged three, has learned a lot from her grandfriends at nursery. \u201cCharlotte\u2019s language, compared to her peers from our antenatal group, is head and shoulders above. She uses words in the right context and talks in full sentences.\u201d\n\nNot all of the older residents were convinced at first. Among the doubters was Dorothy Hulford, 87, a former university administrator who moved in with her 95-year-old husband, Frank, last year. When I first encounter Dorothy, she is too busy crafting a clay elephant with two-year-old Alfie to even look up. Later, she stops for a chat by reception. \u201cI was sceptical,\u201d she admits. \u201cIndifferent.\u201d But she soon got sucked in, and now spends as much time in the nursery as she can, \u201chappy and flattered\u201d to be accepted by the children. \u201cI\u2019m not one for cuddles,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I do enjoy going for a \u2018pramble\u2019.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Going for a \u2018pramble\u2019 \u2026 Ralph Barnes and Sam Mort, a nursery staff member, take a group of toddlers on a walk. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian\n\nThe word \u201cpramble\u201d was coined by resident Joan, a keen rambler sad she could no longer take to the fells. \u201cWe said: \u2018Well you can walk with us,\u2019\u201d remembers Ludden. Prambles, where young and old stroll down the canal in a carnival of wheelchairs, walking frames, buggies and prams, are now one of Belong\u2019s most popular intergenerational activities. Invariably leading the procession by proudly pushing a six-seater buggy is Ralph Barnes, 68, who lives in a Belong apartment with his mother, 87-year-old Doreen.\n\nSome might consider these walks risky, says Ludden. \u201cIf you said to somebody, would you let someone with dementia push a pram along the canal? Everyone would go: absolutely not. But we would say: absolutely, why not? Because when all the measures are in place, when you\u2019ve got additional staff, when you all know each other and can interconnect, there is absolutely no reason not to.\u201d\n\nToo often older people living in care facilities don\u2019t get these sorts of opportunities, says Belong\u2019s chief executive, Martin Rix. \u201cThe underlying philosophy we have here is that we\u2019re trying to enable people to live happy, joyful lives and having the nursery integrated adds a whole new dimension to that.\u201d\n\nThe change in some of the older residents is remarkable, says Egersdorff. \u201cWe call it unfurling. We see it in some of our older people. When they arrive, they are a bit closed down. Then the children arrive and you can actually see their whole body unfurl.\u201d\n\nJune Davis, 83, a former infant school teacher, arrived last year in a wheelchair, shaking with Parkinson\u2019s and confused because of dementia. \u201cShe\u2019d broken her hip and had a replacement. We never thought she\u2019d walk again,\u201d says her daughter, Paula.\n\nNow, not only can she get up and down stairs but she can pramble to the nearby park. When I visit, she is reading to a group of three-year-olds in Belong\u2019s library, and she sings in the choir.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018I\u2019ve got more friends than before\u2019 \u2026 Alan Hyde shows off his pet budgie, Joey. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian\n\nLast Christmas, Belong held a screening of Frozen and provided polystyrene snowballs for the residents and children to throw at each other. \u201cThe children were helping the older people throw them and I was tearing up because it was just so lovely,\u201d says Farrell.\n\nInteracting with the children is \u201cincredibly important\u201d for the men, thinks Hulford: \u201cThat generation weren\u2019t involved with their children, back then, because they were at work. I see how much they enjoy being with the nursery children now.\u201d\n\nWhen he moved in, Iain Wheelton, an 84-year-old RAF veteran, wasn\u2019t sure he would want to spend time with the children. Now he can often be found racing the toddlers in his wheelchair and letting them press buttons to make it beep. \u201cThe integration here, between the sick, elderly people, the infirm, the children, is the full works: we are all here together. This is what life is about,\u201d he says. \u201cI love the children.\u201d\n\nDespite the palpable joy in the air, having a loved one with dementia is extremely painful, says Tracey Crutchley, accompanying her mother, Shirl Heaton, to the choir. \u201cIt\u2019s awful. There is nothing worse than dementia. I don\u2019t call her mum, I call her Shirl, because it\u2019s part of the process of being able to let go. And you have to be able to let go because if you don\u2019t, it will kill you.\u201d\n\nMoving her mum to Belong, away from her old friends in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, was a very difficult decision, says Crutchley. \u201cBut friends had stopped coming because they didn\u2019t know how to cope with her.\u201d\n\nShe knows her 89-year-old mum is lucky to be able to afford the \u00a31,355 it costs each week to stay in one of Belong\u2019s households, having sold her mum\u2019s home to pay for the round-the-clock care for the rest of her days.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018I love the children\u2019 \u2026 residents join the nursery\u2019s toddlers for singing. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian\n\nBelong accepts local authority-funded placements only if there is a guaranteed top-up from a third party (usually family or friends) to meet the weekly fee. The independent living apartments cost between \u00a3209,000 and \u00a3270,000 for a one-bed and \u00a3286,000 and \u00a3396,000 for a two-bed to buy, with weekly rent costing between \u00a3826 and \u00a31,541, which includes an emergency 24-hour nurse call service, with care packages available at extra cost.\n\nEveryone we meet is in raptures about Belong, and by the time we say goodbye I know that if I lived in Chester and had a preschool child or parents needing extra care, I\u2019d be camped out on the pavement for a spot. So why aren\u2019t there more places like it? Because it is very labour-intensive and costs a lot, says Egersdorrf. The 25-space nursery currently turns a small profit, charging \u00a359 per child a day \u2013 but only because neither she nor Ludden draw salaries and they don\u2019t pay rent to Belong. \u201cI know, we\u2019re mad,\u201d says Egersdorff. \u201cIf you were a chain nursery, you wouldn\u2019t look at doing this because it will cost you off your top-line profit.\u201d They hope that by working with the academics they will be able \u201cto prove this is a better way of early years education and older people\u2019s care\u201d.\n\nShe would like to take the intergenerational concept further, perhaps offering student accommodation: \u201cThis is a university city. Students want cheaper accommodation. I\u2019d say, you can come in with reduced rent, but you\u2019ve got to do 20 hours a week social care.\n\n\u201cI think people are ready for a change,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody is ready to ask: what are the human values for this century post-Covid? How do we want to live and how do we make more of our local communities?\u201d"}

It\u2019s a horror-inspired video game in which players fight to overcome the problems that are holding them back, from fear of failure to addiction. It\u2019s also the centrepiece of her first institutional solo show, which takes on the theme of transformation. I grapple with the game but, by my fourth round, I\u2019m still no good; synthetic screams echo around the empty gallery. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be super hard!\u201d laughs Brathwaite-Shirley. \u201cIt\u2019s all based on things that I\u2019m trying to overcome or have overcome. It didn\u2019t take one turn, it took many.\u201d\n\nThe Rebirthing Room is the latest of Brathwaite-Shirley\u2019s participatory works. The idea came to her after a conversation with a curator about the usefulness of art galleries. \u201cWe were talking about the ways we could use a space to do something more. Rather than just showing a piece, what can it do?\u201d she says. \u201cThen I thought: it would be amazing if you came to a gallery and left as a different person.\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old began making interactive art in 2020 after a misguided comment from a visitor left her questioning her work\u2019s purpose. At the time, her portfolio consisted of videos and animations that documented the London burlesque scene she was involved with, as well as her Black transgender peers. Presented in what she describes as a \u201cbeautiful, retro-aesthetic\u201d style, it created alternative realities for members of her community \u2013 an unconventional approach to archiving to remedy the blind spots in historical records. \u201cSomeone said to me: I really like your work because I can bathe in the visuals and ignore what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Brathwaite-Shirley recalls. \u201cI was like: that\u2019s the best feedback I\u2019ve ever had in my life \u2026 because I cannot do that any more!\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Alternative histories \u2026 2023\u2019s Thou Shall Not Assume. Photograph: Perttu Saksa/Courtesy of the artist and Helsinki Biennial\n\nFrom then on, she started incorporating choices for audience members to make in order to progress through the work. In 2022, she presented Get Home Safe, an arcade-style game inspired by her own experiences of walking around Berlin at night, where players are tasked with guiding the protagonist through dark streets safely. Meanwhile, last year\u2019s browser-based I Can\u2019t Follow You Anymore asks the audience to navigate a revolution and decide who will be saved or sacrificed. \u201cIn interactive work, you have to put effort in to see anything at all,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the choices people make and the feeling they leave with that I\u2019m fascinated with. I think that\u2019s when the real artwork begins to happen.\u201d\n\nKeen to prioritise content over aesthetics, Brathwaite-Shirley\u2019s new work draws on the rudimentary pre-rendered graphics of early computer games. It\u2019s deliberately lo-fi, built from 2D animations, iPad drawings and outdated software, with a VHS-style finish. The grass in the on-screen forest is made from edited photographs of her hands, while the sounds are developed from recordings of herself screaming into her phone \u2013 an extension of her archival project. \u201cI never want to get to this super high-glossy thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to make people\u2019s brains work a little bit more.\u201d\n\nComplete with disorienting sound effects and low lighting, the Rebirthing Room is a fully immersive experience. Surrounding the screens and the handbuilt, audience-operated controller are huge trees draped in fabric and rows of real corn \u2013 a reference to the horror movies she grew up watching.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018I don\u2019t want this super-glossy thing\u2019 \u2026 screenshot from The Rebirthing Room Photograph: Image courtesy of the artist\n\n\u201cThe thing I like about horror is that it makes you want to go through experiences and feelings that you would never want to on a typical day,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the film\u2019s really good, something about it keeps you there. It\u2019s a really nice balance of it being super scary but intriguing enough to keep you with it.\u201d\n\nBeyond being a nifty device to \u201ctrick\u201d viewers into reckoning with their own values and beliefs, Brathwaite-Shirley\u2019s digital universes filled with demons, villains and gore feel appropriate for the current climate. As well as the hostility from outsider groups, it\u2019s also important to highlight all the \u201cmessy nuances\u201d that exist within one\u2019s own, she says: \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re in such a censored time, [where] even speaking about a view that your particular political group agrees with feels dangerous because it feels like you have to say it in the way that they want to hear it. And so for me, presenting a utopia in the settings we\u2019re currently in is very, very much useless.\u201d\n\nChallenging the audience is something she wants to see more of in the art world, which she feels too often favours pleasant, Instagram-friendly experiences. It\u2019s not her aim to make people enjoy her work; she finds a more visceral, emotional reaction more interesting. She tells me that if she leaves a show with only compliments, she feels that her work has done nothing.\n\nShe\u2019s curious about how the audience will respond to the Rebirthing Room. Will they play until they succeed? Or will they, like me, give up? Only time will tell. \u201cI\u2019m just excited to see how I can push it further next time,\u201d she says."}

The motion \u201ccondemns the government for overseeing a 77% increase in knife crime since 2015\u201d, and asks the government to extend recent measures \u201cto cover ninja swords\u201d and \u201cto establish an end-to-end review of online knife sales and introduce criminal liability for senior management of websites which indirectly sell illegal knives online.\u201d Norris said: We believe the government should introduce criminal sanctions on the tech executives who allow knife sales on their online market places. Not just Ofcom sanctions as the government have opted for, but proper criminal sanctions to send a very serious message to these leaders that if their platforms are being used, and they are not actively making sure they are not being used for the sale of dangerous weapons, there are going to be serious consequences. Regarding ninja swords, Norris said \u201cWe would broaden the ban to include a wider range of weapons and to toughen existing rules on serration and length. That would mean finally banning blades such as ninja swords \u2026 if knives and machetes are prohibited, these firms will just move on to pushing ninja swords at customers.

Current legislation means any MP who is suspended from the Commons for 10 days or more can be subject to a recall petition, which triggers a byelection if it is signed by 10% of the MP\u2019s constituents. The leader of the house said: \u201cI think that the main complaint and concern is the trigger for that process, that by the original legislation having gone from 30 to 10 days it doesn\u2019t give you a lot of options, and I think that\u2019s the chief concern with that. \u201cIt\u2019s been in operation for a while.

The emissions for the territorial UK were equivalent to 406.2m tonnes of CO 2 , down 3.5% from 2021 and 50% from 1990. Homes and transport contributed the most to the problem, with domestic transport responsible for 28% of greenhouse gas emissions, and homes and product use 20%. Agriculture was responsible for 12%, electricity supply 14% and industry 14%. Fuel supply was responsible for 8%, and waste 4%. Land use and forestry created 0.2% of greenhouse gas emissions. Domestic transport emissions rose 2% year on year, but government officials mostly attributed this to a bounce-back from the coronavirus pandemic. There was a significant drop in transport emissions in 2020 when people stayed at home due to lockdowns, and travel has not yet recovered to pre-2020 levels. Government policies, such as scrapping high-speed rail projects, building more roads and failing to ensure that rail travel is as reliable and affordable as driving, mean that emissions are unlikely to fall to levels needed to reach net zero, experts have said.

Some clarification was asked for on those spread betting comments from 2023 that have been unearthed after Sunak said he was not a betting man. [See 12.02 GMT] The spokesperson said: As he said this morning, he was surprised by it [the bet] but it reflects the conversation that he had with Piers Morgan [and] reflects his absolute confidence in getting flights of the ground. Does he regret having that confidence? No. He has previously talked about his love and interest in cricket. Obviously, what he was referring to is the fact that in general he\u2019s not a betting person, and obviously the point he was trying to get across in the interview was his full confidence and commitment in getting flights off the ground.

He was passionately pro-European in government and in opposition.\u201d Varadkar said Bruton, who led a coalition government from 1994 to 1997 during a fraught phase of the peace process, had reached out to Northern Ireland unionists. \u201cHe advocated a new patriotism and opposed narrow nationalism. While these views are now held by the majority of people, that was not always the case and he was willing to lead, even when it meant going against the grain.\u201d Varadkar said he drew on his predecessor\u2019s knowledge and experience during Brexit talks with the UK. \u201cThe whole Fine Gael family mourns his loss, and he will always be remembered for his service to our party and to the Irish state.\u201d The former taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who led Fianna F\u00e1il, lauded Bruton\u2019s integrity. \u201cHe was a totally genuine person and always acted in the interests of the people of the country, of the people of need and I wouldn\u2019t have a bad word to say about John Bruton.\u201d Earlier cross-party tributes were paid to Bruton in the Northern Ireland assembly.

Declaring that the \u201cage of Davos man is over\u201d, and championing the protests of French farmers, he said that around the world millions of voters have had enough of an \u201cinternationalist, unaccountable approach to governing\u201d, also citing the election results in Argentina. Rees-Mogg said bodies such as the World Health Organization and Cop climate summit \u201climit our freedom for manoeuvre\u201d. \u201cWe have to restore power to our democratic institutions and take it away from those that seek to override democracy,\u201d he told the event. Judges are tied to the \u201cinternational elite\u201d, and \u201cunaccountable, unelected\u201d quangos are \u201cplugged into EU lawmaking,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to re-establish the traditional relationship between the judiciary and parliament.\u201d View image in fullscreen Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg during the launch of the Popular Conservatism movement at the Emmanuel Centre in central London.

A friend of every country, but conscious of the one that is ours and whose interests we must put first.\u201d\n\n\n\n2h ago 07.18 EST Liz Truss says Sunak\u2019s government has failed to take on 'left-wing extremists' Former prime minister Liz Truss has told the PopCons event in London that Britons want to see lower immigration and want illegal immigrants deported, but that ministers\u2019 efforts are \u201cconstantly being stymied\u201d, and that \u201cConservatives have not taken on the left-wing extremists.\u201d Saying that for two decades Tories had tried to \u201cappease these people\u201d, and also argued that ministers have \u201cresponsibility without having power\u201d, because of institutions having greater sway. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we have not taken on the left enough\u201d she said. She claimed the ideology of leftists disguising themselves as environmentalists is about \u201ctaking power away from families and giving it to the state and unelected bodies\u201d and is drowning out the need for cheaper energy, and hit out at the government for \u201cpandering to the anti-capitalists\u201d, while ordinary people believe \u201cthe wokery that is going on is nonsense\u201d. She said \u201cwokeism seems to be on the curriculum\u201d in schools.

Which is making it slightly awkward that lots of people have pointed out that in July last year he spoke on the BBC\u2019s Test Match Special View from the Boundary podcast with Johnathan Agnew and explained how much he had enjoyed spread betting on cricket. In the clip doing the rounds on social media he told Agnew: It was around that time that spread betting had become a thing online. I had certainly never done it before. I was sitting there working on one side doing my investing finance job, and on the other screen \u2013 it is quite helpful in those jobs you have multiple screens \u2013 I was doing next wicket partnership, next wicket fall, innings total. I just discovered this thing and it was great, so I had the summer doing that as well. It is worth noting, perhaps, that in the interview he was talking specifically about a period of time when he was living in the US, and came back to the UK for the summer doing an internship, during the 2005 Ashes series, and preceded the anecdote by saying discovering spread betting \u201cwas quite dangerous\u201d.

The 26-year-old was born in Ukraine to Ukrainian parents, who moved to Japan when she was five.\n\nSupporters said her victory was helping redefine what it means to be Japanese in a country with a record 3 million foreign residents, while critics questioned how a Caucasian woman could be representative of \u201cJapanese beauty\u201d.\n\nShe has now fallen foul of the puritanical culture that surrounds beauty pageants \u2013 in particular the expectation that contestants lead blameless private lives.\n\nShiino, who became a naturalised Japanese citizen in 2022, returned her title after Shukan Bunshun, a weekly magazine with a record of uncovering scandals, claimed she had been in a relationship with a married doctor.\n\nShiino said she had initially been too scared and confused to tell the truth after the article was published. \u201cI am truly sorry for the huge trouble I have caused and for betraying those who supported me,\u201d she wrote on Instagram late on Monday.\n\nThe Miss Japan Association said it had accepted Shiino\u2019s request to relinquish her title, adding that it was \u201cseriously reflecting\u201d on its part in the controversy.\n\nThe association apologised to the contest\u2019s judges and sponsors and said the Miss Japan title would remain vacant for the rest of the year.\n\nJapanese media reports said pageant organisers had initially supported Shiino over the revelations after she told her modelling agency that she had ended the relationship when she discovered the man was married. But on Monday the agency said it had confirmed that Shiino had continued to see the man.\n\nShiino, who grew up in the central city of Nagoya, had been targeted online after winning the title by those who said a white woman could not possibly be the \u201cface of Japan\u201d.\n\nOthers pointed out that Shiino had met the criteria to enter the pageant, in which contestants must be Japanese citizens, single and aged between 17 and 26 when they apply.\n\n\u201cIf you have Japanese citizenship then you are a Japanese,\u201d another user wrote. \u201cIsn\u2019t that all there is to say?\u201d\n\nIn a tearful acceptance speech delivered in fluent Japanese, Shiino said: \u201cI live as a Japanese person, but there have been racial barriers and many instances where I wasn\u2019t accepted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just filled with so much gratitude that I have really been accepted as a Japanese person today.\u201d\n\nPrevious winners of Japanese beauty contests have sparked controversy due to their backgrounds.\n\nIn 2015, Ariana Miyamoto, who has a Japanese mother and African American father, drew criticism online after she became the first mixed-race woman to represent Japan at the Miss Universe pageant. A year later, Priyanka Yoshikawa, who has Japanese and Indian heritage, represented Japan in the Miss World contest.\n\nJapanese rightwingers were furious when the Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka, whose father is Haitian, was selected to light the cauldron at the opening ceremony of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nBut many others welcomed the decision, pointing out that people of mixed race were becoming increasingly visible in sport, entertainment and even politics."}

But shortly after his wins he was pictured being escorted in handcuffs from the Crypto.com Arena, the LA venue where the awards were being hosted.\n\nThe Los Angeles police department confirmed that he had been arrested and booked for misdemeanour battery and was later released.\n\nAn unnamed \u201csenior law enforcement source\u201d told Rolling Stone that a security guard claimed that Killer Mike allegedly pushed her to the floor after he tried to make his way around her at a venue entrance.\n\nFollowing the incident, Killer Mike \u2013 whose real name is Michael Render \u2013 said in comments to Rolling Stone: \u201cAs you can imagine, there was a lot going and there was some confusion around which door my team and I should enter.

Will you take that bet?\u201d\n\nSunak shook hands with Morgan on the wager and said he was \u201cworking incredibly hard to get the people on the planes\u201d.\n\nThe government\u2019s attempt to send people arriving in the UK through irregular means to Rwanda for their claims to be processed has been blocked by the supreme court, which ruled the policy was unlawful in November. Sunak has said he can salvage the scheme.\n\nHowever, when asked about the \u201cbet\u201d in an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday, Sunak said: \u201cI am not a betting person and I was taken totally by surprise in that interview.\n\n\u201cThe point I was trying to get across \u2013 I was taken totally by surprise \u2013 was actually about the Rwanda policy and about tackling illegal migration, which is something I care deeply about.\n\n\u201cObviously people have strong views on this and I was just underlining my absolute commitment to this policy, my desire to get it through parliament, up and running because I believe you need to have the deterrent.\n\n\u201cI believe you have got to have a deterrent, you have got to have somewhere you can send people so that if they come here illegally they won\u2019t be able to stay.\u201d\n\nHowever, soon after Sunak\u2019s claims that he was \u201cnot a betting person\u201d, it was pointed out on social media that that he had worked in the past as a hedge fund manager and had boasted about discovering the \u201cdangerous\u201d pleasures of spread betting online around the same time.\n\n\u200bIn an interview last year for an episode of the BBC\u2019s Test Match Special podcast, Sunak had recalled that time, saying: \u201cSo I was sitting there on one side working, doing my finance job, and on the other screen I was doing next wicket partnership, next wicket for, innings total. I just discovered this thing and it was great.\u201d\n\nOpposition parties criticised Sunak\u2019s decision to agree to the bet with Morgan. The shadow paymaster general, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \u201cNot a lot of people facing rising mortgages, bills and food prices are casually dropping \u00a31,000 bets. It just shows that Rishi Sunak is totally out of touch with working people.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish National party reported Sunak to the independent adviser on ministers\u2019 interests, Laurie Magnus, claiming the bet could be a breach of the ministerial code.\n\nAsked if he understood the financial pressures facing ordinary households, given he had made a \u00a31,000 bet on a whim, Sunak said: \u201cWhen it comes to cost of living, when I first got this job I set out five priorities \u2013 the first of them was to halve inflation because I absolutely understood that the cost of living was the most pressing problem most families faced.\u201d\n\nAsked if it shocked him that poor families were reportedly having to water down baby formula, the prime minister replied: \u201cOf course I am sad to hear that people are in that situation.\u201d\n\nHe said it was difficult to comment on individual cases that were put to him and he committed to sitting down with the people involved if he was written to."}

However, there\u2019s another round anniversary this summer that won\u2019t be celebrated, because it marks a big failure. On 30 August 1954, a vote in the French national assembly killed the project of a European Defence Community (EDC). Instead, European integration proceeded around the economic community that remains the core of the EU to this day, and European security was built around the US-led Nato. But as the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, advances from the east and the US presidential contender Donald Trump threatens to withdraw from the west, it\u2019s time to revisit the idea of Europe defending itself.\n\nHistorical circumstances were obviously very different 70 years ago, but there are some interesting echoes. Then as now, a key driver for the European defence initiative was an aggressive Russia. Then as now, another driver was the desire of the US to focus more on threats involving China in Asia \u2013 in that case, the Korean war, which began in 1950. (The EDC treaty was signed in 1952, while the war was still going on.) Then as now, a central issue was the military role to be played by the Federal Republic of Germany. France\u2019s then prime minister, Pierre Mend\u00e8s France, summed up the reasons his parliament rejected the EDC with perfect French clarity: \u201ctoo much integration and too little England\u201d. Might there also be a lesson there?\n\nToday, a European defence project would not be a single, clear, unified institution of the EU. That was the road not taken 70 years ago. Rather, it would be a European defence community with a lowercase d and c, connecting European, bilateral and national capabilities to the existing military operational core in Nato. If you ask what are the structures of European security today, the answer is at once mind-numbingly complicated and perfectly simple. The result of multiple initiatives to strengthen European defence is an impenetrable jungle of acronyms and monikers. How will SHAPE work with CJEF and JEF, taking account of the St Malo declaration, the \u201cBerlin Plus\u201d agreement, Pesco, EDF, EPF, Asap and EDIRPA? (You really want to know?)\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s very simple: 80 years on from D-day, Europe still depends on the US for its defence. In slightly longer form: Europe depends on Nato for its defence, and Nato depends on the credibility of the article 5 guarantee from the US. Credibility is the key word for deterrence, as confidence is for financial markets. Strictly speaking, article 5 only commits a Nato member to take \u201csuch action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force\u201d, if an ally is attacked. So where will Europe be if President Trump doesn\u2019t \u201cdeem it necessary\u201d to defend Estonia? Or, prior to that, if Putin no longer believes \u2013 perhaps miscalculating, as he did over Ukraine \u2013 that Washington would do so.\n\nThe most likely Trump shock is that he will pull the rug out from under Ukraine. Europe must therefore urgently increase its ammunition and weapon supplies and its training for the Ukrainian army so that Kyiv can not merely defend the territory it currently controls but actually turn the tide of the war in 2025. This should be Europe\u2019s objective even if Trump does a handbrake turn on US support and tries to negotiate a deal with Putin over Ukraine\u2019s head.\n\nSecond, Europe must do more for its own conventional defence. Unlike the first Trump presidency, his second is being carefully prepared, with detailed plans drawn up by friendly thinktanks. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s 2025 presidential transition project defines the relevant goal thus: \u201cTransform Nato so that US allies are capable of fielding the great majority of the conventional forces required to deter Russia while relying on the United States primarily for our nuclear deterrent and select other capabilities, while reducing the US force posture in Europe.\u201d\n\nIf we\u2019re honest, isn\u2019t this a reasonable ask? Eighty years after D-day, why should a continent with an economy of similar size still depend so heavily on the US for its security?\n\nIn a market economy, arms manufacturers need large, definite orders before they ramp up production, and Europe\u2019s defence industry is not getting enough of those, fast enough. As Ukrainian soldiers have found to their cost, it\u2019s also a crazy zoo of different weapon types. A Munich security conference study identified 178 types of major weapon systems in European armies in 2016, compared with 30 in the US. In practice, increased European defence spending would also mean more business for the US. As the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, pointed out in a speech last month to the Heritage Foundation, US arms manufacturers already received European orders worth $120bn over the last two years \u2013 an argument that should appeal to \u201cart of the deal\u201d businessman Trump.\n\nWhat if it\u2019s a Force 9 Trump shock, meaning the US president undermines the credibility of American nuclear deterrence defending the Baltic states? Unlikely though that eventuality is, we need to start thinking more about European nuclear deterrence. Under the 1962 Nassau agreement, Britain\u2019s rather clunky old nuclear deterrent is put at the disposal of Nato, which means theoretically also for the defence of the Baltic states \u2013 although the ultimate decision lies with the British prime minister. France\u2019s nuclear doctrine does not specify over whom precisely the president will extend his nuclear parasol. \u201cMourir pour Dantzig?\u201d was the notorious headline of a 1939 French newspaper article, arguing that French soldiers should not be asked to die for what was then the Free City of Danzig (today\u2019s Gda\u0144sk). \u201cMourir pour Narva?\u201d would be the question now \u2013 Narva being an Estonian city right on the border with Russia. No other European power has a nuclear deterrent.\n\nI list these three levels of Trump shock in ascending order of gravity, but also of probability. Europe\u2019s priorities should follow: first, Ukraine; second, spend more and better on conventional defence; third, think about the ladder of nuclear deterrence. To achieve any of this, every country, institution and tendency involved needs to jump over its own shadow. Politically difficult though this will be, European defence procurement must reduce its narcissism of national difference. Britain and its continental European partners must work more closely together. The two Brussels-based giants, Nato and the EU, need a better working relationship. Gaullists and Atlanticists should seek common ground, understanding that a more European Nato is the only credible military core of an effective European defence community today.\n\nPerhaps someone would like to convene a conference to discuss all these issues, on the 70th anniversary of a historic failure? Conference motto: don\u2019t be scared, be prepared."}

Place the flour in the first bowl, the beaten eggs in the second bowl, and the breadcrumbs in the third bowl.\n\nTake each mozzarella ball and roll it in the flour until evenly coated, ensuring the entire surface is covered.\n\nDip the floured mozzarella ball into the beaten eggs, making sure it's fully coated.\n\nRoll the egg-coated mozzarella ball in the breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere the breadcrumbs to the surface.\n\nRepeat this process for all mozzarella balls.\n\nPlace the coated mozzarella balls on a tray or plate and freeze for 20 minutes.

Toss the wings in the bowl to fully coat each piece. The corn starch will help achieve a crispy exterior.\n\nIf desired, add your preferred seasonings to the wings. This could include garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, or a seasoning blend of your choice.\n\nToss the wings again to distribute the seasonings evenly.\n\nPreheat the air fryer to 380\u00b0F for a few minutes.\n\nPlace the coated and seasoned chicken wings in a single layer in the air fryer basket, ensuring they\u2019re not overcrowded. If necessary, cook the wings in batches.\n\nCook the wings in the air fryer at 380\u00b0F for 30 minutes, turning them halfway through the cooking time. Adjust the time based on your air fryer model and the size of the wings. The wings should be golden brown and crispy when done.\n\nTo ensure the chicken wings are fully cooked, check for an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F using a meat thermometer.\n\nOnce cooked, transfer the wings to a serving platter.\n\nServe wings immediately with your favorite dipping sauces.\n\nHearty chili:How to make the best classic chili\n\nSlow Cooker Chili Cheese Nachos\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 can (15 oz) pinto beans, drained and rinsed\n\n1 can (15 oz) red kidney beans, drained and rinsed\n\n1 lb ground pork, browned and drained\n\n1 cup water\n\n1 packet (about 2.5 oz) taco seasoning\n\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n\n1 cup salsa\n\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n\n2 cups shredded cheese (cheddar, Mexican blend, or your choice)\n\nTortilla chips, for serving\n\nInstructions:\n\nIn the slow cooker, add the drained and rinsed pinto beans and red kidney beans.\n\nAdd the browned and drained ground pork to the beans in the slow cooker.\n\nPour 1 cup of water into the slow cooker, ensuring it reaches all the ingredients.\n\nEvenly distribute the taco seasoning over the mixture in the slow cooker.\n\nSprinkle the garlic powder into the slow cooker for added flavor.\n\nAdd 1 cup of salsa to the mix.

Despite those findings, it's not uncommon for many new products like the Vision Pro to receive a cold reception \u2013 at least at first.\n\nProducts like AirPods and cell phones that were once treated with skepticism or even outright mockery are now a ubiquitous part of our daily lives. Others, like Google Glass, simply never caught on.\n\nLearn more: Best credit cards of 2023\n\nHere's a look at five products that initially caused puzzlement and even annoyance upon their release, along with how they have since fared.\n\n'The Simpsons' did it?Did the classic animated series predict Apple's Vision Pro? Product is eerily similar to fictional device\n\nAirPods\n\nInitial reception: It may be hard to remember a time when people listened to music or talked on the phone with anything other than wireless Bluetooth headphones.\n\nBut the world to which Apple AirPods were introduced in 2016 was hardly welcoming. Reviews were critical of the tech product, while the general public met its launch with widespread ridicule.\n\n\"AirPods feel very much like a first draft \u2026 I cannot get them to stay in my ears for long periods of time,\" the Verge wrote in a review at the time of release.\n\nIn an even less-kind review, the Guardian compared the earbuds to a \"tampon without a string.\"\n\nAirPods also became a source of mockery across the internet, with some users joking about the ease with which they will be lost and others comparing their appearance to everything from electric toothbrush heads to blow dryers.\n\nWhat happened: AirPods have proven to be a lucrative commodity for Apple, which has seen the earbuds only grow in popularity as the years go by.\n\nAirPods reportedly brought in $14.5 billion in revenue in 2022, technology news site Techweez reported in August, citing data from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC.) The figure is a sign that product is only becoming more popular six years after its release after making $12.1 billion in revenue for Apple in 2021.\n\nGoogle Glass\n\nInitial reception: Not all things are destined to survive the sands of time.\n\nTake Google Glass, a device that in many ways was a precursor to Vision Pro: the product was mocked upon its release in 2013 and then ... just faded into seeming obscurity.\n\nInconsiderate users of the product \u2013 wearable computers mounted on eyeglass frames \u2013 became known as \"Glassholes\" and were banned from bars and ostracized in public amid privacy concerns.\n\nSome optimism did exist that Google Glass devices could potentially usher in the future of journalism, but it was not meant to be.\n\nWhat happened: Despite efforts in 2014 to revamp the product with new frames to make them less techy-looking, Google Glass was discontinued in 2015 due to its limited appeal.\n\nGoogle attempted a comeback in 2017 with improved functionality for the product. However, amid a market already becoming flooded with augmented and virtual reality products, the glasses never became a part of most Americans' daily lives.\n\nSegway\n\nInitial reception: After months of hype, Segways rolled out in 2001 with their two-wheeled, all-electric, self-balancing designs.\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos and venture capitalist John Doerr were early investors in what was billed as a method of transportation so groundbreaking, that even Apple co-founder Steve Jobs predicted cities would be redesigned around the device, CNET reported at the time.\n\nThe Segway's inventor Dean Kamen was no less bold in his own prognostications, telling Time magazine that the vehicle would \u201cbe to the car what the car was to the horse and buggy.\u201d\n\nWhat happened: Needless to say, it didn't quite work out that way.\n\nBecause of their ability to sense and respond to the slightest shifts in your balance, the machines may have been fun enough to ride \u2013 but may not have been worth the $5,000 price of ownership. By the time Segways fell out of production in 2020, just 140,000 units had been sold, Fast Company reported.\n\nBut the scooters still do have their uses: Segways are still a popular mode of transportation for a variety of city tours, while \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" made light of their infamous use by mall security.\n\nCredit cards\n\nInitial reception: It's hard to remember a time when credit cards weren't the primary means of paying for purchases.\n\nBut in the 1990s, cash was king, as was evidence in a news report unearthed last year that shows Burger King customers apprehensive about the new form of payment.\n\nTikTok user @noesox was the first to share the viral clip of a news report from 1993 about Burger King\u2019s decision to start accepting credit cards.\n\n\"I think it's pretty bad if you have to use a credit card when you go to a fast food restaurant,\" one woman at Burger King told the reporter.\n\n\"I just hope it doesn't slow things down,\" said another customer.\n\n\"I'm sure it'll work for people on vacation,\" yet another man said. \"But I can't imagine it working on a day-to-day basis.\"\n\nWhat happened: If you make a habit of carrying cash in your wallet or purse these days, you're among an ever-shrinking group, Pew Research has found. And the fact that you most likely have not one, but multiple credit cards in your name is evidence of how the hand-wringing over the payment method turned out.\n\nThe internet\n\nInitial reception: Yes, even something as omnipresent as the internet was once a new and perplexing invention.\n\nIn 2019, the Today Show unearthed a clip from 1994 in which anchors Katie Couric, Elizabeth Vargas and Bryant Gumble expressed confusion about the internet, as well as email.\n\n\"What is internet anyway?\" a bemused Gumble asked in the segment, which was also referenced in a 2015 Super Bowl ad.\n\nHumorous with the benefit of hindsight, the anchors' collective confusion was not unlike many Americans who at the time were just trying to figure out whether the internet would have any utility in their lives.\n\nWhat happened: Considering the medium in which you're reading this article, I think it's safe to say the internet wasn't exactly a mere fad.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Involuntary manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, and Crumbley is set to be sentenced in April.\n\nProsecutors argued Jennifer Crumbley knew her son \u2013 15 at the time of the shooting \u2013 was struggling with alarming mental health issues. They said instead of getting him the help he needed, she and her husband, James, bought their son the gun used in the attack and attempted to flee when it was becoming likely they would be charged. James Crumbley, who faces the same charges as his wife, is scheduled to go on trial in March.\n\nJennifer Crumbley, who took the stand in her own defense last week, said she never foresaw her son's deadly actions. She said her son did not show signs of being mentally ill other than being anxious about school and his future after graduation. She also said that while she and her husband bought their son the firearm, he was only allowed to use it at the shooting range with his dad. She said it was her husband's responsibility to securely store the gun.\n\nShe faced forward and kept her eyes closed as the jury delivered its verdicts. Craig Shilling, whose son Justin was killed in the shooting, looked on stoically as the verdict was read. Two people touched his back. Jennifer Crumbley then bowed her head and kept her eyes downcast as she walked, handcuffed, past a bank of cameras.\n\nOakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald hugged relatives of the victims, including Shilling.\n\n\u201cI feel most of all that the cries have been heard, and I feel that this verdict is going to echo throughout every household in the country,\u201d Shilling said, adding that accountability is something parents have been asking for, but the verdict is just one step in that process.\n\n\u201cWe all have work now. We all know that we are to be held responsible for anything that we do,\u201d he said.\n\nGuilty verdict could impact views on gun safety\n\nThe groundbreaking trial is likely to impact how society views parents' responsibility when their children access guns and use them in mass shootings, legal experts said.\n\n\u201cThis is a case that could create real incentives for parents to be much more cautious giving their children access to firearms,\" Adam Winkler, of the UCLA School of Law, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Jennifer Crumbley's lawyer Shannon Smith said the case could set a dangerous precedent for parents who are trying to do their best for their children.\n\n\"I do wish, more than anything, that this case could bring justice to victims of the shooting, and to the victims of the terrorism that day,\" Smith said. \"This is not justice. This is not how justice works. This does nothing for people who have lost everything \u2026 and it does nothing to (undo) the tragedy that unfolded on Nov. 30.\"\n\nThe shooter, now 17, was sentenced to life without parole in December after pleading guilty to multiple charges for the shooting that killed Madisyn Baldwin, 17; Tate Myre, 16; Hana St. Juliana, 14; and Justin Shilling, 17.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s verdict underscores the important responsibility of parents and gun owners in preventing children from having unsupervised access to deadly weapons,\" Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement.\n\n\"Plain and simple, the deadly shooting at Oxford High School in 2021 should have \u2014 and could have \u2014 been prevented had the Crumbleys not acquired a gun for their 15-year-old son. This decision is an important step forward in ensuring accountability and, hopefully, preventing future tragedies.\"\n\nDefense, prosecution argued over foreseeability\n\nThe seven-day trial largely focused on the foreseeability of the shooter's deadly actions and whether Jennifer Crumbley could have prevented it.\n\nThe prosecution cited a handful of text messages sent eight months before the shooting in which the teenager texted his mom that he saw a \"demon\" in their house and that clothes were flying around. He also texted a friend that he had \"paranoia\" and was hearing voices. The prosecution cited a journal the shooter kept, in which he wrote: \"I have zero HELP for my mental problems and it's causing me to shoot up the ------ school.\"\n\nJennifer Crumbley testified she never saw the texts her son sent his friend; she never saw her son's journal; and that her son never asked her to take him to a therapist. If he had, she said she would have gotten him an appointment. She also testified that she didn't think it was relevant to notify the school that her son had access to a gun at home, saying she never thought her son would harm others as he had never been in trouble before.\n\nOn the morning of the shooting, the Crumbleys were summoned to the school over a troubling drawing their son had made on a math worksheet featuring a gun, a bleeding human body and the words, \"The thoughts won't stop. Help me.\"\n\nSchool officials told the parents their son was having a hard time and needed to be seen immediately by a mental health professional. Counselors at the school testified in Jennifer Crumbley's trial that because they were unaware that the teen might have access to a gun, they allowed him to stay at school that day, concluding that it would be better for him to be around peers than be alone at home. According to court testimony, the Crumbleys were never asked whether their son had access to a gun nor did school administrators search his backpack \u2013 where the teen kept the firearm \u2013 because they felt they had no probable cause to do so.\n\nThe parents returned to their jobs and promised to get their son counseling within 48 hours. Two hours later, their son fired his first shot.\n\nJennifer Crumbley testified that she and her husband did not bring him home because they were following the advice of the school officials who, she said, told her her son would be better off in class with peers rather than home alone.\n\nCRUMBLEY TRIAL:Case could set precedent for how parents' responsibility is viewed\n\nIn closing arguments, defense attorney Shannon Smith told jurors \u201cno one could have expected this, including Mrs. Crumbley.\"\n\nBut Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald urged jurors to remember that Jennifer Crumbley said she \"wouldn't do one thing different.\"\n\n\u201cThe tragic part about it is none of it was hard. None of it,\u201d McDonald said. \"The smallest thing, just the smallest thing, could have saved Hana and Tate and Justin and Madisyn.\u201d\n\nContributing: Ryan W.

This action is the largest single-day bribery takedown in the history of the Justice Department,\" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said.\n\nIn a press release, the DOJ announced the unsealing of the complaints. Additionally, prosecutors said 66 of the 70 people charged were arrested this morning in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and North Carolina.\n\nThe employees in the case were charged with \u201caccepting cash payments from contractors in exchange for awarding NYCHA contracts.\u201d according to the press release.\n\nAccording to the complaint, NYCHA is the largest public housing authority in the country receiving about $1.5 billion in federal funding every year and provides housing for a little more than 5% of the city's occupants.\n\nCorruption:NJ finds 'widespread fraud and corruption' in addiction treatment industry\n\nDOJ says workers received over $2M in corrupt payments\n\nThe complaint alleged that typically when the agency needed to hire outside contractors they would have to solicit multiple bids for the work, except in instances where the work would cost less than $10,000. According to prosecutors, the employees charged demanded and received cash \"in exchange for NYCHA contracts\" in these no-bid contracts.\n\nThey would either require the contractors to \"pay upfront\" to get the contract or will require \"payment after the contractor finished the work and needed an NYCHA employee to sign off on the completed job,\" so they could get the payment, prosecutors said.\n\nOfficials demanded between 10 to 20% of the contract value, while some requested even more, the DOJ said.\n\n\"In total, these defendants demanded over $2 million in corrupt payments from contractors in exchange for awarding over $13 million worth of no-bid contracts,\" the news release said.\n\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Inspector General Rae Oliver Davis said the scheme wastes \"millions of dollars and risk residents staying in unacceptable living conditions.\"\n\n\"The alleged conduct identified during this investigation harms the effectiveness of housing programs that support more than 200,000 residents. It also poses a significant risk to the integrity of the HUD rental assistance programs that support housing assistance in New York City and erodes the trust of NYCHA residents in HUD\u2019s programs. We will continue our work with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and our law enforcement partners to prevent and detect these and other schemes,\" Davis said."}

Maraj was found guilty of predatory sexual assault after being charged with repeatedly raping an 11-year-old girl at his home in November 2017. He was later sentenced 25 years to life in prison."}

But how and when those remains were laid to rest, and who was \u2212 and was not \u2212 included in the process are the subject of bitter contention, especially after a private interment in late January and dedication ceremony days later.\n\nThat disagreement is not unique to the Penn Museum, the University of Pennsylvania or Philadelphia. It's part of a larger national reckoning over science, history and anthropology, over the racism that was often part of the pursuit of knowledge, over art and artifacts obtained through unscrupulous means or outright theft, over people whose bodies were used without their consent or the consent of their loved ones.\n\nA push to return stolen artifacts:Experts say that requires an 'institutional transformation.'\n\naAliy Muhammad, a writer and community organizer in West Philadelphia, became aware of the Morton Cranial Collection in 2019 during a symposium at the university.\n\n\"I was angry and moved to take action,\" they said. They organized a Change.org petition to have the Philadelphians' remains repatriated, writing op-ed pieces in the Philadelphia Inquirer and other publications saying: \"At the very least Penn can disavow Morton, and bury our ancestors.\"\n\nThe museum did inter the remains, privately placing them in a mausoleum in a historic Black cemetery just outside Philadelphia in late January and then commemorating them in a two-part ceremony Saturday at the museum and at Eden Cemetery.\n\nBut Muhammad and others say the museum hurried the interment, did not include the community in the interment process and continues to \"deny these Black ancestors' dignity\" in the same way Morton did.\n\n\"We can give them a respectful and sacred burial,\" said Muhammad, who lives in West Philadelphia and traces their family history in the same neighborhood as the University of Penn back to the late 1800s. \"Instead, Penn decided to rush the interment. We want to see Penn give up control of these remains to the community, to Black Philadelphians.\"\n\nA long and complicated process\n\nPenn Museum director Christopher Woods said the institution has been as transparent as possible and has \"recognized and prioritized the human dignity\" of the remains.\n\nA page on the museum website chronicles the museum's ongoing efforts toward \"repatriation and repair,\" including its own research into the Morton collection, formation of a community advisory committee to determine the best way to honor the remains and petitioning the city's Orphan's Court for burial and protection of the remains.\n\nNone of the remains have been identified, except for those belonging to John Voorhees, who died in 1846, nor do any show evidence of prior burial.\n\nWoods told USA TODAY that through the process, which included legal notices and news coverage in local newspapers, there was scant opposition to interring the 19 crania \u2212 certainly nothing like the widespread outrage that came with revelations that remains of victims of the 1985 MOVE bombing were in the possession of a museum researcher.\n\nNews reports about the Morton collection \"portray this as a huge disconnect with community,\" Woods said. \"But no one has come to us about (the Morton remains)\" other than Muhammad and Lyra Montiero, a Rutgers professor and anthropological archaeologist who along with Muhammad launched Finding Ceremony, an initiative aimed at repatriation of the MOVE and Morton remains.\n\n\"(The community advisory board) emphasized to me that these people's remains to not belong in some museum storeroom and that they should be laid to rest,\" Woods said. \"If we hadn't gone through this process, they would still be languishing in some storage room.\"\n\nWho decides what makes a 'community'?\n\nMuhammad believes the community advisory committee convened by Penn is a misnomer, and that has tainted how the remains are laid to rest.\n\n\"Penn is misusing the word 'community,'\" they said. \"It's not about positionality; it's about rooted Black people who care about (the owners of the remains) in life and after life.\"\n\nMembers of the advisory board, they said, are affiliated with the city, the university or the museum and \"have limited purview and understanding of what's at stake.\"\n\nMuhammad believes the museum should have engaged a wider swath of the Black community in Philadelphia and proceeded more deliberately to find out more about the people whose remains Morton collected to see whether descendants could be located and informed. It was not the museum's place, they said, to decide the ultimate fate of the remains.\n\nCharles Lattimore Howard, the university chaplain and vice president for social equity and community, rejected the idea that his employment at Penn precludes him from wanting the institution to properly honor the Black Philadelphians' remains.\n\nHe described \"a deep resentment and grief and pain\" upon learning of Morton's racist motivations and the dangers posed by his ideas.\n\n\"And the second level of it was that this disregard for Black bodies and the holding onto of these skulls without interring them added to the pain and shock of the situation,\" said Howard, who is Black.\n\nWoods, he said, took the initiative to right institutional wrongs that his predecessors did not and has acted \"with integrity and a commitment to getting it right,\" in honoring the remains.\n\n\"I get that Penn is what it is, a big, old institution that's done a lot of good and a lot that's not good,\" said Howard, a Baltimore native who's lived in Philadelphia for 28 years.\n\n\"But we live here, too, and we're part of the history of Black liberation. That's not lost just because I have a Penn ID in my pocket.\"\n\nRenee McBride-Williams has lived in West Philadelphia for about 60 years and is not affiliated with Penn. She served on the advisory committee, invited by Penn because of her leadership of Cedar Park Neighbors.\n\n\"I believe if you broke it, you fix it,\" she said. \"So they should be responsible for the burial of as many of the remains as possible, because these were human beings. To live in poverty as they did, to die of a disease, to have your corpse taken ... I felt as though I needed to speak for these people who could not speak.\"\n\nShe and other committee members spoke with others in the community, too, to learn what they thought. It also mattered to her that Woods and Tia Jackson-Truitt, Penn Museum's chief diversity officer, are both Black.\n\n\"It had to begin somewhere. It was a matter of doing the right thing, and it felt right to me to have them interred with some dignity. How much longer did you want to keep them out, not resting in peace?\"\n\nHoward, the Penn chaplain, acknowledged that many Black people rightfully distrust big institutions such as Penn.\n\n\"But one thing I've thought a lot about is that everyone involved, on university side or community members who\u2019ve been critical, is trying to do what\u2019s right,\" he said.\n\n\"Everyone\u2019s heart is in the right place.\""}

Beal was been traded to the Suns last season after spending 11 seasons with the Wizards.\n\nBeal scored a season-high 43 points for the Suns in the win.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks suffered a 123-108 defeat against the Utah Jazz in their most recent game despite Giannis Antetokounmpo's impressive performance of 33 points, 13 assists and seven rebounds.

The disease was once a leading killer in the United States but modern diets, food storage and other changes have led to it being uncommon. However, it's often missed in the early stages because it has easy-to-mistake symptoms.\n\nKeith died after battling the disease for three years. He went public with his diagnosis in 2022, saying he'd received chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to fight the cancer.\n\nStomach cancer mostly affects older people, possibly because it can in some cases be linked to a lifetime of certain behaviors. The average age of diagnosis is 68, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nThat said, the incidence in younger people is starting to increase, said Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal oncologist with the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. That may be the result of higher levels of overweight and obesity and possibly overuse of antibiotics in childhood, which can alter the gut health.\n\nIn the early 20th century stomach cancer was the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. But the rate of new stomach cancer cases in the United States has been going down steadily, about 1.5% every year for the last decade.\n\nIf caught early, stomach cancer is more easily treated. Unfortunately, many cases are not discovered early, in part because the symptoms are relatively common.\n\nHere's what to know about stomach cancer, a disease that affects about 27,000 and kills almost 11,000 Americans each year.\n\nWhat is stomach cancer?\n\nStomach cancer, also called gastric cancer, is fairly uncommon, making up about 1.5% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States each year. It targets the organ that breaks down and digests food.\n\nMost of this type of cancer occurs in the lining of the stomach. It can be focused at the top, where the stomach meets the esophagus or in the main portion of the organ. According to the Mayo Clinic, in the United States, the most common type occurs at the junction of the stomach and esophagus.\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of stomach cancer?\n\nStomach cancer is often not detected early because the initial symptoms are easy to mistake for other conditions.\n\nThe key is to pay attention to long-term changes, said Kamath.\n\n\u201cI always tell people we shouldn\u2019t be alarmist, millions of people have some of these symptoms but only thousands have stomach cancer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlso, think of change from baseline,\u201d Kamath said. \u201cDid I have these symptoms a few months ago? Did I notice this was a problem last year?\u201d\n\nDuration is the thing to look for. \u201cEveryone has an upset stomach from time to time,\u201d Kamath said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re having the same symptoms for a month, that\u2019s more concerning and (it's) time to reach out to your doctor.\u201d\n\nEarly symptoms can include:\n\nOngoing heartburn or indigestion\n\nFeeling bloated after meals\n\nFeeling full after only a few bites of food.\n\nMore advanced stomach cancer can cause these symptoms:\n\nDifficulty or pain when swallowing\n\nPersistent stomach pain\n\nNausea and vomiting\n\nBlood in stool (resulting in black stool)\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nUnexplained weight loss\n\nWhat causes stomach cancer?\n\nThere are not always clear risk factors for developing stomach cancer, but some factors tend to be associated with the onset of the disease. These include:\n\nA diet high in smoked and salted foods and processed meat\n\nA diet low in vegetables and fiber-rich foods\n\nDrinking alcohol\n\nSmoking tobacco\n\nBeing overweight or obese.\n\nMen are at higher lifetime risk for developing stomach cancer than women, about 1 in 101 versus 1 in 155 for women. However, risk can be affected by many factors.\n\nHow treatable is stomach cancer?\n\nIf caught early, stomach cancer is more easily treated. Unfortunately, many cases are not detected until the cancer is advanced and has grown through the stomach wall or spread to other parts of the body, when it is harder to treat and cure.\n\nTreatment includes chemotherapy, radiation and surgery.\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, the 5-year relative survival rates for different stages of stomach cancer are:\n\n75% for cancer that has not spread beyond the stomach\n\n35% for cancer that has spread beyond the stomach to nearby lymph nodes or organs\n\n7% for metastatic stomach cancer that has spread beyond the stomach to a distant part of the body\n\nWhy is the rate of stomach cancer dropping?\n\nScientists aren\u2019t entirely sure why, but two factors that likely contributed to the decrease in cases:"}

Regular vaccinations and screenings are the most effective way to prevent the cancer, says WHO.\n\nIn India, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women, accounting for nearly one-fifth of the world\u2019s cervical cancer cases, according to the National Library of Medicine.\n\nExperts and health activists are urging the Indian government to roll out national HPV vaccinations for young girls to bring down cases and stop the cancer from claiming lives.\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Trump is the expected Republican presidential nominee, and he is viewed by many conservatives as the de facto head of the party.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe reversal among Senate Republicans is a stunning turnaround from just a few months ago, when they demanded that Democrats attach a border security solution to President Joe Biden's request for $106 billion in additional aid to Ukraine, Israel and other foreign security priorities.\n\nSenate Republicans are poised to block a border security bill that a bipartisan group of lawmakers spent months working on \u2013 and which they demanded in exchange for additional aid to Ukraine. The U.S. sent the last of the congressionally approved assistance last year, and Biden warned on Tuesday of far-reaching consequences to America and its allies if deal is not reached.\n\nLess than two days after the bill that funded Biden's national security priorities came out, nearly half of the Republicans in the Senate have said they are against it.\n\nMost argue it doesn't go far enough to stop illegal migration into the United States, some say it doesn't make sense to advance legislation that is \"dead on arrival\" in the House, and some would prefer to leave it as an election-year issue.\n\nThe third-ranking Republican in leadership, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., came out against the bill Tuesday morning, saying \"Americans will turn to the upcoming election to end the border crisis.\"\n\nThe second-ranking Republican, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. wouldn't commit Monday to voting for it, saying he's \"still reviewing the text,\" and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly did not actively lobby for or against the bill during a closed-door meeting last night \u2013 instead telling members they should vote against a procedural vote to move the package forward on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the meeting Monday night, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., the lead GOP negotiator on the bill, said he anticipates that the Wednesday vote does not pass and that Senate Republicans will vote together to stop consideration for the moment. At least 60 votes are needed in the Senate to consider the legislation.\n\n\"I would anticipate that people are saying 'hey, I need a lot more time to go through this,'\" Lankford said. Even Lankford himself would not commit to voting to move forward the legislation that he crafted.\n\nMany Republican senators have said they want more time to consider possible amendments to the legislation, while others have said the package is close to dead. Behind the scenes, concerns about the 2024 presidential election or opposition to Ukraine funding are adding additional complications to negotiations.\n\nSome conservatives who back military assistance to Israel in the House have been pushing for Europe to foot more of the bill for Ukraine's defense.\n\n\"We need a separate Border and Immigration Bill. It should not be tied to foreign aid in any way, shape, or form!\" Trump said in a Monday social media post.\n\nTrump called the bill a \"highly sophisticated trap for Republicans to assume the blame\" for problems at the border \"just in time for our most important EVER Election\" in another post. \"Don\u2019t fall for it!!!\" he wrote.\n\nBiden said Tuesday that Republicans must decide whether they serve the American people or his predecessor, as he accused them of letting \"petty, partisan politics\" derail the compromise legislation.\n\nIf the bill fails this week, Biden said he'd would campaign on its defeat.\n\n\"Every day, between now and November, the American people are going to know that only reason the border is not secure is Trump and his MAGA Republican friends,\" Biden pledged. \"It's time for Republicans in the Congress to show a little courage, show a little spine.\"\n\nBiden, who wore a Ukraine tie and pin to demonstrate his ongoing support for the nation, said the clock is \"ticking\" to send Ukraine additional weapons so it can defend itself against Russia's onslaught.\n\n\"We can't walk away now. That's what Putin's betting on,\" Biden said. \"Supporting this bill is standing up to Putin. Opposing this bill is playing into his hands.\"\n\nSweeping changes to immigration\n\nLankford worked with Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., over months to craft a border security bill that would implement sweeping changes to the way migrants are apprehended and processed at the border.\n\nThe proposal, released Sunday evening, would vastly expand detention at the border and speed up humanitarian asylum programs. It would also make it harder for people to qualify for asylum and fill out the border wall.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial element of the package is a new three-year policy to essentially shut down processing of asylum applications from people who crossed illegally if the number of expulsions and apprehensions of migrants reaches an average of 5,000 illegal crossings per day for a week. Based on the number of migrants currently crossing the southern border, that threshold would likely trigger that new mechanism immediately.\n\nHowever, several Republican senators have said it would instead allow up to 5,000 migrants per day. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who is referring to the bill as the \"Border Never Closes Act\" and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said it \"does NOTHING to actually secure the border.\"\n\nIt is included in an emergency spending bill that would appropriate more than $60 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel, and $10 billion humanitarian aid \u2013 a longstanding request of President Joe Biden's that has the support of both McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nThe Senate will vote on cloture on the bill on Wednesday, a procedural vote that would advance the bill and make it available for a majority vote of the full Senate. A higher threshold \u2013 60 senators \u2013 is necessary to pass the procedural hurdle."}

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The jury of six men and six women deliberated for about 11 hours before finding Crumbley, 45, guilty of four counts of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of Hana St. Juliana, 14; Tate Myre, 16; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; and Justin Shilling, 17. The Crumbleys bought their son a gun four days before the shooting as an early Christmas gift, a fact that propelled their prosecutions as the first parents of a mass shooter to face such serious charges in connection to their child\u2019s crime. Crumbley\u2019s husband, James, 47, faces identical charges at a trial scheduled for March.\n\nCrumbley\u2019s then-15-year-old son brought a gun to Oxford High School on Nov. 30, 2021, and killed four students, while wounding seven other people. Ethan Crumbley was charged as an adult and pleaded guilty to two-dozen charges, including a rare charge of terrorism. He was sentenced to life without parole in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case against the Crumbleys is at the forefront of prosecutions against the parents of juvenile shooters, a strategy some prosecutors embrace as they and the public reassess who can be held accountable for a child\u2019s violent actions.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I think the sea change is that as we\u2019re grappling with an ocean of firearms, we are going to \u2014 and should \u2014 see more of these prosecutions brought,\u201d said Eric Rinehart, the Lake County States Attorney in Illinois who prosecuted the father of the Highland Park shooter for sponsoring the shooter\u2019s firearms card despite knowing of his mental health issues.\n\n\u201cThis verdict confirms that the legal system will hold parents criminally responsible when they [allow] their kids access to firearms and they are also aware of their kids dangerous statements or behavior,\u201d Rinehart said. He noted in the Highland Park case, the two year delay between the parent\u2019s action and the harm they caused warranted reckless conduct. In Crumbley\u2019s case he said \u201cthe time span of hours or days warranted involuntary manslaughter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the jury forewoman read the verdict, Crumbley\u2019s reaction was not clearly visible as she sat hunched next to her lawyer, but she looked dejected as sheriff\u2019s deputies led her away in restraints. Outside the courtroom, disappointed Crumbley supporters walked away and declined to speak.\n\nFamily and supporters of the victims reacted solemnly, some with quiet tears and others with sighs of relief. After the verdict was read, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald leaned into the gallery to hug Craig Shilling, whose son, Justin, was among the slain students. \u201cThank you,\u201d Shilling said softly as he shook hands with members of the prosecution\u2019s team.\n\nShilling told reporters after the verdict his son was an \u201cawesome individual\u201d whom he thinks about every day.\n\n\u201cHe loved life, and he deserved to live it,\u201d Shilling said. He called her conviction important for accountability, and noted there was still another trial to get through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcDonald and her team presented two theories in their case against Crumbley: that she was \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d by failing to properly store the gun her son obtained and that she failed her legal duty to prevent her child from harming others.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nMost of the evidence in Jennifer Crumbley\u2019s trial had already been introduced during her son\u2019s hearings. Victims\u2019 family members again heard how James Crumbley bought a gun for his son at a Black Friday sale four days before the shooting and that Jennifer Crumbley took her son to a shooting range the following day.\n\nThe court also heard now-familiar testimony from witnesses like the shooter\u2019s counselor, who noticed in 2021 he seemed sadder than usual, and the shooter\u2019s assistant principal, who locked eyes with him as the carnage began.\n\n\u201cIt was when I realized it was Ethan that I didn\u2019t think he could possibly be the shooter,\u201d Oxford High School Assistant Principal Kristy Gibson-Marshall recalled on the witness stand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOxford High School counselor Shawn Hopkins testified when the Crumbley parents were called to school the morning of the shooting to discuss violent drawings and messages from a math assignment, he worried the shooter was showing signs of suicidal rather than homicidal ideation. The shooter had scrawled phrases \u201cThe thoughts won\u2019t stop. Help me,\u201d \u201cmy life is useless,\u201d \u201cblood everywhere\u201d and \u201cthe world is dead\u201d along drawings of a gun, a bullet and a bleeding body.\n\nProsecutors also presented text and Facebook messages Crumbley exchanged with her son, husband and friends that gave a view into some of the shooter\u2019s behavior in the eight months before the incident. They included texts where he told his mother he believed the house was haunted and that he was seeing demons and objects flying around the room.\n\nCrumbley\u2019s trial was the first time a jury heard either of the parents speak about their actions directly. While the defense is not required to present a case since the prosecution bears the burden of proof, attorney Shannon Smith called Crumbley as a defense witness. From the stand, Crumbley had an opportunity to counter the prosecution\u2019s narrative of her as a negligent, distant mother who ignored her son\u2019s pleas for help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrumbley testified that her son had never been in trouble before, and that while she noticed he might be depressed, she understood he was struggling with the deaths of his grandmother and the family\u2019s dog, followed by his only friend moving away. Texts about seeing demons and hallucinating people in the house were interpreted as her son playing on the family\u2019s running joke that their 1920s home had a ghost, Crumbley said.\n\nCrumbley tracked her son\u2019s grades and closely monitored when he was home from school, she said, but she did not read his private journal or text messages with his friend, where he shared more violent, troubling thoughts.\n\nCrumbley\u2019s son had struggled through the pandemic and was anxious about his future, including college, but not troubled \u201cto a level where I felt he needed to go see a psychiatrist,\u201d she testified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the counselor\u2019s meeting the morning of the shooting, Crumbley testified she was concerned, but understood \u2014 as did the counselor and school dean \u2014 that they were dealing with a mental health issue, not disciplinary one. Crumbley\u2019s son asked to go back to class, and she and her husband said they had to return to work.\n\nThe Crumbley parents, who maintain the gun was locked and hidden separate from the bullets in their bedroom, did not mention the new gun purchase or that their son recently visited a shooting range. Neither the parents nor school staff searched the shooter\u2019s backpack before he was sent back to class. Two hours later, the teen opened fire in school."}

Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight The early findings, which have not been previously reported, indicate that the drone may have been missed \u201cdue to its low flight path,\u201d a U.S. defense official with direct knowledge of the assessment told The Washington Post. Additionally, this person said, the base, known as Tower 22, was not outfitted with weapons that can \u201ckill\u201d aerial threats like drones, and instead relied on electronic warfare systems designed to disable them or disrupt their path to a target.\n\nA common strategy among drone operators and other pilots seeking to minimize or evade radar detection is to fly low to the ground. Another U.S. official affirmed the military\u2019s belief that the drone flew too low to be detected. Both officials, like some others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive and ongoing investigation. Defense officials have stressed that assessments can change as investigators learn more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaken together, the preliminary findings appear to undermine previous assertions that U.S. air defenses mistook the attacking aircraft for an American drone returning to the base about the same time, and they raise new questions about the Pentagon\u2019s ability to keep pace with the threats facing U.S. personnel deployed across the Middle East since the war in Gaza set off an acceleration of violence.\n\nU.S. Central Command, which oversees military activity throughout the region, has declined to say whether officials believe the militants responsible had knowledge of the base\u2019s limited defenses.\n\nIn a statement, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Central Command continues to review the attack. \u201cFor operations security reasons, we won\u2019t discuss specific force protection measures or potential posture changes,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, as always, we are committed to taking necessary measures to safeguard our forces [who serve] in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTower 22 is located at the nexus of Jordan\u2019s shared border with Syria and Iraq. It functions as a support site for another U.S. outpost, the isolated Tanf garrison in Syria, situated along a key highway connecting Tehran to Damascus. From Tanf, U.S. forces have sought to disrupt Iran\u2019s efforts to supply weapons and materiel to partners and proxies in Syria and beyond.\n\nThe Jan. 28 attack in Jordan killed three Army reservists from Georgia, the first American deaths from hostile fire since Israel\u2019s war in Gaza triggered repeated attacks on U.S. positions in Iraq and Syria by groups affiliated with Iran. There have been at least 168 such incidents since mid-October, according to Pentagon data.\n\nAt Tower 22, dozens of other personnel were wounded in the blast, which struck a housing unit during the early morning while many of the 350 troops deployed there were in bed asleep. In response to the deadly violence, U.S. warplanes on Friday struck more than 85 targets in Iraq and Syria that military officials said were associated with the Quds Force, a unit of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and local militias it supports.\n\nAlthough Tower 22 was outfitted with \u201cmultiple\u201d electronic warfare systems capable of taking drones offline, it had limited means to protect itself. The defense official with direct knowledge of the military\u2019s early assessment said the outpost was deemed a relatively low-threat environment. \u201cThis was based on the vast majority of the threats and 99 percent of the [Iranian-proxy] attacks being against facilities in Iraq and Syria,\u201d the official told The Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe base\u2019s defensive posture has changed in the attack\u2019s aftermath, the official said, but declined to elaborate.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cWe are not waiting for the investigation to be complete to implement changes from lessons learned in the tragic attack on Tower 22,\u201d the official said.\n\nWhile the U.S. military has long deployed systems such as the Patriot and C-RAM (short for Counter Rocket Artillery Mortar) to defend American positions against enemy attack, there is a limited inventory of those weapons and officials have had to prioritize their deployment based on the perceived threat facing specific locations. At the same time, the Pentagon has scrambled in recent years to develop new means for protecting installations from rapidly evolving drone attacks that can evade traditional air defense.\n\nAn immediate takeaway from last week\u2019s deadly attack in Jordan, the second U.S. official said, is the need for better drone-detection systems that can give American personnel more time to identify and destroy such threats before they can put lives at risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExperts note that there are other solutions, known as passive defenses, that can be used to obscure or shield against aerial attacks. Anti-drone nets, for instance, and other barriers such as chain fences have been installed overhead at vulnerable sites in Ukraine to block or detonate drones before they can hit their intended targets.\n\nIdeal air defense strategies, experts say, incorporate a mix of systems, sensors and passive solutions.\n\nThe containerized housing structures at Tower 22 appear to be the standard units typically found at U.S. facilities overseas. They are made of relatively thin metal that is not designed to withstand blasts on their own, and can be easily identified on commercial satellite imagery and services such as Google Maps.\n\nOfficials have not said whether protection was installed above the units before the attack. Concrete barriers positioned on the ground among the housing units did help to mitigate the explosion, officials said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to continuously refine your defenses based on the threat,\u201d the second official said, adding that additional recommendations are likely to come from an analysis of the attack.\n\nIran has proliferated drones of various types and sizes, including Shahed one-way attack drones in use by Russia\u2019s military in Ukraine. Tehran also has provided unmanned aerial vehicles to its aligned militias in the Middle East. One official described the drone used in the Jordan attack as a Shahed-101, a weapon that used by militants in Iraq. The Pentagon has not publicly identified what type of system was used.\n\nEarlier threat assessments that concluded Tower 22 faced a lower risk of attack meant the base appeared not to have been \u201coutfitted with other active countermeasures similar to what other locations across the region had been,\u201d said Paul Lushenko, an assistant professor and director of special operations at the U.S. Army War College who has studied and written about drone warfare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re recognizing here in real time is the emergence of this vulnerability from the aerial domain that we have to think about more deliberately, and that this sort of outpost may not be protected as well going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nThe military should consider a wider range of passive measures to combat drones, he said, including ways to physically block them even if they managed to evade missile defenses."}

Circuit ruling that he is not immune from charges for his acts as president. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight The unanimous decision, from two Democratic-nominated judges and one Republican-nominated one, sets the stage for a potential appeal to the Supreme Court. If Trump ultimately were to succeed, his federal indictment for an allegedly illegal effort to overturn the 2020 election \u2014 one of four indictments he faces \u2014 would be undercut severely.\n\nBut for now, the courts have decisively rejected Trump\u2019s novel claims, with significant implications for what lies ahead.\n\nBelow, some takeaways.\n\n1. The decision was full-throated\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to rule against Trump; it\u2019s another to do so as decisively as the unanimous judges did. In repeatedly knocking down his claims to immunity, they served notice that it wasn\u2019t a particularly close call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judges rejected Trump\u2019s claims that allowing a former president to be criminally charged would chill the actions of future presidents, who would be constantly concerned about their own indictments. They rejected the idea that impeachment was a substitute or a necessary precursor to criminal charges for a president. And, perhaps most notably, they cast the idea of Trump\u2019s being immune as a potentially dangerous precedent.\n\n\u201cAt bottom, former president Trump\u2019s stance would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the President beyond the reach of all three Branches,\u201d the judges wrote, adding: \u201cWe cannot accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter.\u201d\n\nThey added later: \u201cIt would be a striking paradox if the President, who alone is vested with the constitutional duty to \u2018take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\u2019 were the sole officer capable of defying those laws with impunity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey said there was \u201cno functional justification\u201d for finding Trump immune.\n\nThe judges cast Trump as effectively saying a president should have \u201ccarte blanche to violate the rights of individual citizens to vote and to have their votes count.\u201d\n\nAnd more than that, they noted that Trump\u2019s attempt to cling to power illustrates precisely the kind of case in which such immunity could go so badly wrong.\n\n\u201cWe cannot accept former president Trump\u2019s claim that a President has unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power \u2014 the recognition and implementation of election results,\u201d the judges wrote.\n\n2. It used Trump\u2019s and his lawyers\u2019 own words against him\n\nRepeatedly in the ruling, the judges pointed to the words of Trump and his own attorneys.\n\nMere hours before the decision, Trump on Monday night claimed that not having immunity would mean \u201cEVERY PRESIDENT THAT LEAVES OFFICE WILL BE IMMEDIATELY INDICTED BY THE OPPOSING PARTY.\u201d The judges, in their ruling, noted that Trump himself regularly notes that his indictments, as a former president, are unprecedented \u2014 suggesting that any fear of post-presidential indictments becoming routine is imagined or at least overblown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Despite this, Trump\u2019s campaign repeated the claim in a statement after the ruling.)\n\nThe judges noted that despite Trump\u2019s claim to absolute immunity, his own attorney effectively conceded that presidents aren\u2019t absolutely immune; the lawyer told the judges last month that a former president could, in fact, be charged as long as he is first impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate.\n\nThey noted that Trump\u2019s own impeachment lawyers granted that he could still be criminally charged even if acquitted by the Senate. One of those lawyers said the criminal courts were actually the more appropriate venue, given that Trump was a former president at that point.\n\nAnd, finally, the judges advanced the idea that this very argument might actually have helped Trump win his impeachment acquittal.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cThe forty-three Senators who voted to acquit him relied on a variety of concerns, many of which had nothing to do with whether he committed the charged offense,\u201d the judges wrote, adding: \u201cIndeed, at least thirty Senators who voted to acquit relied at least in part on a belief that the Senate lacked the power to convict a former president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn essence, the judges called Trump out for disowning the technical argument that may have won his impeachment acquittal.\n\n3. It hamstrings Trump\u2019s efforts to delay\n\nIt has always seemed unlikely that Trump would prevail with his novel and sweeping arguments. But the decision and its timing have some practical implications.\n\nOne is that he could face tough sledding if he asks for an \u201cen banc\u201d review \u2014 one in which the entire appeals court weighs in \u2014 or even looks to the more conservative-leaning Supreme Court; the decision was just that strongly against him.\n\nPerhaps the bigger one, though, is what the decision means for the schedule of his trial. Part of the motivation for pursuing this immunity claim appears to be that it has caused delays in the trial, which was initially set for next month. (Trump has made clear he doesn\u2019t want to face trial during the 2024 campaign.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the judges have now hamstrung him to some degree. They put their ruling on hold only until Monday, and it would remain on hold only if Trump appeals to the Supreme Court. That effectively means he could ask for an en banc review by the full appeals court first, but that wouldn\u2019t prevent Judge Tanya Chutkan from pressing forward.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s strategy is delay, one tactic has been blunted.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign quickly signaled it would appeal the ruling, but it didn\u2019t address where or when.\n\n4.

The claim from former president Donald Trump\u2019s legal team that he should be offered blanket immunity against federal charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith in Washington was not generally viewed as particularly serious. Instead, it was often seen simply as a way to delay the criminal trial ahead of the presidential election. Should Trump win that election, after all, the legal issue goes away.\n\nThe arguments used to bolster the immunity claim \u2014 that, for example, his impeachment in the wake of the Capitol riot in 2021 meant that further prosecutions posed a \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d threat \u2014 similarly prompted eye-rolling among experts. But the D.C. Circuit Court still needed to consider and parse those arguments, offering a detailed rebuttal to what Trump\u2019s attorneys and allies had put forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its ruling on the question, made public Tuesday morning, the court dismissed the idea that Trump\u2019s impeachment was an obstruction to his criminal prosecution. In doing so, it also undercuts a common refrain about the impeachment from Trump \u2014 and dinged some of the senators who rose to Trump\u2019s defense.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys had tried to block the D.C. prosecution by noting that his impeachment in the House after the Jan. 6, 2021, riots had been followed by a Senate trial that culminated in acquittal. The Fifth Amendment protects people from being tried twice for the same crime so, they argued, the former president couldn\u2019t be criminally charged by the special counsel.\n\nThe court\u2019s rejection of this argument was direct: \u201c(1) An impeachment does not result in criminal punishments; and (2) the Indictment does not charge the same offense as the single count in the Impeachment Resolution.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cImpeachment,\u201d the ruling states, \u201cis a political process that is instigated and overseen by the Congress.\u201d This is true \u2014 and something that Trump has at times tried to gloss over. He likes to suggest that the impeachments he faced were solely a function of Democratic political action (as opposed to also being rooted in actual wrongdoing on his part) but then to treat his two acquittals as apolitical exonerations of his actions. They were not.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe ruling pointed this out.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the political nature of impeachment proceedings, impeachment acquittals are often unrelated to factual innocence,\u201d the court wrote.\n\n\u201cFormer President Trump\u2019s acquittal in his impeachment trial on the charge of inciting insurrection makes this point. The forty-three Senators who voted to acquit him relied on a variety of concerns, many of which had nothing to do with whether he committed the charged offense,\u201d it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ruling walks through the hodgepodge of reasons offered by the senators. Some were procedural, as with Sen. Todd Young\u2019s (R-Ind.) complaint that the House rushed the impeachment itself. Some were political, such as Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s (R-Wis.) disparagement of the impeachment as \u201cvindictive and divisive.\u201d Thirty senators, the ruling noted, had objected to the impeachment because by the time the trial was conducted, Trump wasn\u2019t president anymore \u2014 what the court dubbed \u201cjurisdictional\u201d objections.\n\nThose same senators \u2014 including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u2014 got another call-out in the ruling. Trump\u2019s attorneys had argued that Trump couldn\u2019t be criminally charged unless had first been impeached and convicted. If that were the case, the court wrote, and if those senators\u2019 jurisdictional concerns were valid reasons not to convict, it would mean that no former president could ever be convicted of a crime committed in office. If you have to impeach before indicting, and you can\u2019t impeach someone out of office, that\u2019s that. Exoneration ad absurdum.\n\nThat \u201cImpeachment is not a criminal process and cannot result in criminal punishment\u201d by itself suggested that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against double jeopardy didn\u2019t apply, the court argued. Trump \u201cdoes not seriously contend otherwise,\u201d the ruling continues, \u201cand he does not explain why he believes that impeachment can implicate \u2018double jeopardy principles\u2019 when it does not involve criminal punishment.\u201d Those scare quotes might justifiably be viewed as judicial eye-rolling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no mystery about why Republican senators declined to convict Trump during the impeachment trial in February 2021. Even by then, it was clear to Hill Republicans that their base was sticking with Trump \u2014 meaning that there was a political cost to be paid in trying to hold him to account. Some voted to convict Trump anyway, earning wrath from Trump and the base."}

Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight \u201cWe cannot accept former President Trump\u2019s claim that a President has unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power \u2014 the recognition and implementation of election results,\u201d the panel of three judges wrote. \u201cNor can we sanction his apparent contention that the Executive has carte blanche to violate the rights of individual citizens to vote and to have their votes count.\u201d\n\nThe ruling comes days before the Supreme Court considers another untested question raised by Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2014 whether the former president is an insurrectionist barred by the Constitution from returning to the White House because of his actions around Jan. 6.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has already indicated that he plans to ask the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court to review the immunity ruling. The court set tight deadlines for that review, saying it would put the ruling on hold until Feb. 12 for Trump to appeal to the Supreme Court but would not wait for the full D.C. Circuit to weigh in.\n\nWhile his legal arguments keep failing in court, even rulings against him aid his goal of delaying any federal trial in D.C. until after the presidential election, in which he is the Republican front-runner.\n\nTrump\u2019s trial had been scheduled for March 4, one of four criminal prosecutions Trump faces while simultaneously campaigning to regain the White House. But it was delayed last week while the appeals process on the immunity issue continued.\n\nThe Justice Department has long held that a current president cannot be prosecuted. But Trump raised the novel claim that former presidents cannot either, at least for actions related to their official duties, unless impeached and convicted by Congress first. Having been acquitted by the Senate of inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, Trump said that to try him in federal court would be a double jeopardy violation.\n\nBoth assertions were viewed skeptically by legal scholars, several of whom served in Republican administrations, who wrote to the court that Trump\u2019s position was \u201cabsurd,\u201d and by the three appellate judges who heard the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s paradoxical to say that his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate criminal laws,\u201d Karen L. Henderson, the lone Republican on the panel, said during arguments over the case in early January.\n\nAsked at that hearing whether Trump\u2019s view of presidential impunity could allow for the assassination of a political rival, defense attorney D. John Sauer did not disagree. He only suggested that such an action would \u201cspeedily\u201d result in impeachment.\n\nFor years, former president Donald Trump's lawyers said he should only be immune from charges while in office. Now, they say he should have absolute immunity. (Video: JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\n\nDuring the hearing, Judge Florence Y. Pan said the impeachment exception undermined rather than strengthened Trump\u2019s argument. By conceding that a former president could be charged after impeachment, she said, Trump was admitting that there is no absolute immunity and only quibbling about the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYour separation of powers arguments fall away, your policy arguments fall away,\u201d Pan said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nSauer invoked his own hypothetical harms, suggesting that a ruling against Trump would lead to \u201ccycles of recrimination\u201d in which every former president is charged with a crime. George W. Bush could be prosecuted for justifying the Iraq War with false intelligence, he said; Barack Obama could be prosecuted for drone strikes that killed civilians.\n\nTrump himself was more explicit. Having already promised if reelected to use the Justice Department to \u201cgo after\u201d Biden, he said after arguments in the D.C. Circuit that a ruling against him would mean \u201cbedlam in the country.\u201d In a statement Tuesday, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said the ruling \u201cthreatens the bedrock of our Republic\u201d and that \u201cevery future President who leaves office will be immediately indicted.\u201d\n\nJustice Department attorney James Pearce told the appellate judges that while a future court might rule that presidents have criminal immunity for some war-related decisions, that wasn\u2019t relevant now. What Trump is accused of sets him apart from any other White House occupant, Pearce said: \u201cNever before has there been allegations that a sitting president has, with private individuals and using the levers of power, sought to fundamentally subvert the democratic republic and the electoral system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s impeachment claim relied on a single line in the Constitution saying that while Congress can only remove a person from office, \u201cthe party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment.\u201d Trump argued that that must mean the opposite is also true, as he put it in his filings: \u201cA president who is not convicted may not be subject to criminal prosecution.\u201d That reading, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan said in her ruling on the case, defies the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the text, the \u201coriginal understanding\u201d of it based on historical records, and \u201ccommon sense.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also in direct contradiction to what Trump contended at his impeachment trial in 2021, something multiple judges on the appellate panel emphasized. At the time, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that because he was already out of office, any punishment for his actions should come from the criminal justice system rather than Congress. Several senators, including then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), cited that reasoning in voting against impeachment.\n\nTrump relied heavily on a 1982 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that presidents, current and former, should be immune from civil suits related to their White House work. But that court explicitly said its concern about \u201cthe distraction of suits by disappointed private citizens\u201d did not apply to criminal prosecutions in which there is greater \u201cpublic interest.\u201d As Judge J. Michelle Childs noted during oral argument, after resigning the presidency, Richard M. Nixon received a pardon for any criminal activity he \u201ccommitted or may have committed\u201d \u2014 an acceptance that he could have been charged with a crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump is also being sued by police officers and lawmakers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6. A different panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit ruled late last year that those suits could go forward because campaigning for reelection is not an \u201cofficial act.\u201d Trump has indicated he plans to appeal that ruling as well.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit ruling is not binding in any other jurisdiction where Trump is accused of a crime. He is making similar arguments in Georgia, where he is accused of interfering specifically in that state\u2019s 2020 election. But in that case, Trump is also arguing that the Constitution\u2019s \u201csupremacy clause\u201d bars state prosecutors from indicting a former president. The special counsel has declined to address that issue, saying in court filings that \u201cprosecution by a state or local entity would raise separate questions.\u201d In New York State Court and Florida federal court, Trump faces trial for actions that he took before or after his presidency.\n\n\u201cWe do not address policy considerations implicated in the prosecution of a sitting President or in a state prosecution of a President, sitting or former,\u201d the D.C. Circuit said in a footnote to its ruling.\n\nSpencer S. Hsu and Ann E. Marimow contributed to this report."}

ArrowRight As of Tuesday morning, more than 150,000 California customers were without power, and at least three people have been confirmed killed after impacts extended well beyond where the rain was most concentrated. While the worst of the storm had already affected most of the Golden State and flood watches have been dropped in Northern and Central California, parts of Southern California still faced significant rains, locally damaging winds and, in the mountains, heavy snowfall.\n\nAround 10 a.m. local time, areas of heavy rain were still pushing inland from roughly Burbank to San Diego, where another inch or two was possible. Heavy rain between Long Beach and Irvine had prompted flash flood warnings around Anaheim and north into southeastern Los Angeles County through midday, after which downpours were expected to ease or become more intermittent. Another flash flood warning was in effect to the south from roughly Irvine to Oceanside until 1 p.m. A thunderstorm or two was even possible that could produce small hail or an isolated tornado.\n\nAn atmospheric river brought up to 6 inches of rain to Los Angeles on Feb. 5, resulting in mudslides that destroyed homes and blocked roads. (Video: John Farrell/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the higher elevations of Southern California, snow continues. The San Bernardino and Riverside County mountains could see another 4 to 8 inches of snow above 6,000 feet, with up to 2-plus feet above 8,000 feet elevation. Mountain snows continue in the Sierra Nevada, too, and will expand into the Great Basin of Nevada, as well as the Four Corners region. Winter storm warnings plaster the Southwest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne small piece of good news is that destructive winds have finally subsided and no longer look to pose a concern. Gusts reached 70 to 80 mph in the Bay Area and topped 100 mph in the mountains. At Palisades ski resort near Lake Tahoe, a mountaintop station reported a gust to 148 mph.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the storm?\n\nOn Monday night into Tuesday morning, the storm underwent some restructuring.\n\nPreviously, a low-pressure center had been located offshore of Eureka in Northern California. That counterclockwise-spinning low dragged the atmospheric river to its east into Southern California. A second batch of downpours had formed beneath the core of that low pressure.\n\nBut in the past 12 to 18 hours, that main low has dissipated \u2014 meaning the showers beneath it have largely vanished, causing rainfall to ease in Northern California. Simultaneously, however, a new low is forming over Southern California within the broader batch of rain and will shift northeast into Nevada.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat caused an expansion of the rainfall overnight in Southern California, but the new low will drag the atmospheric river eastward and out of the area. By Tuesday evening, it should be aimed mainly at Nevada.\n\nThat means two things:\n\nThe coverage of rainfall will decrease for Las Vegas and San Diego by the afternoon hours.\n\nThe intensity of precipitation will become more variable; while the main slug of rain will push east, a few thunderstorms will pinwheel into Southern California into Wednesday. Much of the time will be dry, but a few brief bursts of heavy rainfall, with rates of 0.5 to 1 inch per hour, are possible. That could trigger additional flooding until the rain finally stops entirely later Wednesday.\n\nThe eastward push of the atmospheric river will bring heavy rains to Arizona. Phoenix is under a flood watch and could see an inch of rain, give or take. The heaviest will fall from Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday morning local time.\n\nIn the higher elevations, it\u2019s all snow. That\u2019s true across the Four Corners, where a plowable mountain snow is expected.

In 2023, she announced that she was a naturalized Japanese citizen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Japan, the private lives of public figures are also regularly held up to scrutiny, with media attention being unrelenting when celebrities are seen to have fallen short \u2014 and critics say female public figures seem to be judged particularly harshly.\n\nOne scandal in 2013, for example, involved a young pop star, Minami Minegishi, who was found to have broken her management firm\u2019s rules by spending a night with her boyfriend. Her management company demoted her as a result \u2014 and she uploaded a tearful apology video that showed she had shaved her head in contrition \u2014 leading to shocked headlines around the world.\n\nOnline, some commenters asked why an affair would disqualify Shiino from holding the Miss Japan crown \u2014 and questioned whether the other party involved would face similar consequences. \u201cThe Miss Japan Association should deeply reflect on why in cases of infidelity the socioeconomic consequences fall disproportionately on the unmarried female and not the married man,\u201d said one."}

But Jay Graber immediately got excited. An idealistic, former software developer who had tried unsuccessfully to build her own social media system, Graber, then 28, saw Twitter\u2019s involvement as the key to making the idea a reality. She applied and was chosen in August 2021 to lead the project, called Bluesky, and soon convinced Twitter honchos that it would work best as an independent organization, so that it wouldn\u2019t be dependent on Dorsey for support.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see the future,\u201d Graber said in an interview Monday, referring to the subsequent ouster of Dorsey as Twitter\u2019s CEO and sale of the company to Elon Musk. \u201cBut as I like to say, the captain can always sink the ship.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, Bluesky is opening to the public after nearly a year as an invitation-only app, with Graber as its CEO. With a little over 3 million users, it\u2019s mounting a long-shot bid to take on the company that spawned it \u2014 and to set social media on a course that no single captain can control.\n\nOn the surface, Bluesky looks familiar to anyone who has used Twitter or Meta\u2019s Threads, with a feed full of text posts and images from people you follow. Underneath, however, the company is building what Graber calls \u201can open, decentralized protocol\u201d \u2014 a software system that allows developers and users to create their own versions of the social network, with their own rules and algorithms. She compared the idea to email, where users of different apps like Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo Mail can interact freely because they all run on the same underlying technology.\n\nThat system is a work in progress. So far, Bluesky is the only social network using its protocol. But it already has some features that set it apart.\n\nFor instance, users can subscribe to feeds where algorithms prioritize the most popular posts overall or the posts most popular among the people they follow. There are also options for feeds geared to their specific areas of interest, such as science or art. And users can toggle personal moderation settings that either \u201chide,\u201d \u201cwarn\u201d or \u201cshow\u201d categories of content such as nudity, violence, spam and hate-group iconography.\n\nAlong with today\u2019s public launch of Bluesky, the company said it will roll out in the coming weeks a step toward its broader vision, inviting some outside developers to host servers that plug in to the main Bluesky network. It also announced a new feature that will let users and organizations begin to develop their own content moderation services, which other users can then subscribe to. For instance, a fact-checking organization could apply \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cmisleading\u201d labels to certain posts, which would then be seen by users who opt in to seeing them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea of a decentralized social media system is similar to that behind Mastodon, a seven-year-old nonprofit that relies on individual users and organizations to host and moderate their own, sometimes insular corners of its network. But Bluesky said its protocol would work differently, letting users customize their experience but keeping the network fundamentally public.\n\nFirst launched on iOS in February 2023, Bluesky quickly surged in popularity among users disenchanted with Musk\u2019s Twitter. Savvy social media users begged one another for \u201cinvite codes\u201d to join the fledgling network, whose quirky first adopters gave it a vibe that some likened to the early days of Twitter. Vibrant communities sprang up around art, transgender identity and media, drawing large pockets of users in Brazil and Japan as well as the United States.\n\nBut with fewer than a dozen employees at the time, Graber put off a public launch, fearing that it would force the company to spend all its resources on maintaining and moderating the Bluesky network rather than building out the underlying \u201cdecentralized\u201d system.\n\nIn the meantime, social media behemoth Meta launched Threads, which has rocketed to 130 million monthly active users in just seven months, according to the company\u2019s latest earnings report. In a call with investors last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it\u2019s \u201con track, I think, to be a major success.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nX has more than half a billion monthly active users, CEO Linda Yaccarino said last fall, though apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult because X does not regularly report industry-standard metrics.\n\nRose Wang, who oversees operations and strategy for Bluesky, said its goal is to combine the ease of use and shared experience of closed platforms like X and Threads with the user choice and openness of systems like Mastodon\u2019s. With Mastodon, which requires you to select and join one of thousands of differently managed servers before you can participate, \u201cthere\u2019s almost too much user choice,\u201d Wang said. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re joining.\u201d\n\nFor Bluesky, which now has a few dozen employees, mounting a serious challenge to X or Threads would be an uphill battle. Some of the early enthusiasm appears to have waned, with high-profile users such as Chrissy Teigen and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) going dormant or leaving the platform after making headlines when they joined last year. Even Dorsey, who remains a Bluesky board member, appears no longer to have an active account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA page that tracks user statistics on Bluesky shows that the number of users actively posting each day has dipped slightly over the past month.\n\nStill, at a time when the content moderation decisions of tech\u2019s giants routinely alienate swaths of users, Wang said she\u2019s optimistic the company\u2019s choose-your-own-adventure approach will have enduring appeal.\n\n\u201cLots of people want a different experience that\u2019s not something run by Mark Zuckerberg or another billionaire,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go back to a world where there\u2019s only one microblogging client like Twitter.\u201d\n\nMike Masnick, editor of the blog Techdirt and a longtime tech analyst, has followed Bluesky\u2019s progress from the start, after a paper he wrote helped to inspire Dorsey to create the project. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a lot of smart things that give me hope,\u201d he said of Graber and her team. \u201cI think it could carve out a successful space even if it doesn\u2019t beat Threads.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstagram CEO Adam Mosseri, who runs Threads, has said he also hopes to eventually make it interoperable with federated protocols such as Mastodon\u2019s. But Threads so far has only tested limited versions of that functionality.\n\nAmy Zhang, a professor at University of Washington\u2019s Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, has been researching Bluesky to study how users respond when given options to control their feeds and moderation systems. Whether Bluesky takes off, she said she\u2019s interested to see whether other platforms adopt some of the features it\u2019s pioneering.\n\n\u201cThis idea that there\u2019s one algorithm for everybody\u2019s feeds \u2014 that there\u2019s one moderation setting for millions of people \u2014 it\u2019s kind of impossible, and it doesn\u2019t fit a lot of people\u2019s needs,\u201d Zhang said."}

Jack Sweeney, a junior at the University of Central Florida, has for years run accounts that log the takeoffs and landings of planes and helicopters owned by hundreds of billionaires, politicians, Russian oligarchs and other public figures, along with estimates of their planet-warming emissions. The accounts use publicly available data from the Federal Aviation Administration and volunteer hobbyists who can track the aircraft via the signals they broadcast.\n\nSweeney\u2019s accounts fueled a free-speech debate in late 2022 when X, formerly Twitter, banned Sweeney for sharing what the platform\u2019s owner, Elon Musk, said were his \u201cassassination coordinates.\u201d The accounts don\u2019t say who travels on the aircraft or where they go once the planes land.\n\nTravis Kelce celebrated his team's AFC championship with girlfriend Taylor Swift on Jan. 28. (Video: James Palmer via Storyful)\n\nIn December, Swift\u2019s attorney at the Washington law firm Venable wrote Sweeney a cease-and-desist letter saying Swift would \u201chave no choice but to pursue any and all legal remedies\u201d if he did not stop his \u201cstalking and harassing behavior.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSweeney\u2019s accounts had caused Swift and her family \u201cdirect and irreparable harm, as well as emotional and physical distress,\u201d and had heightened her \u201cconstant state of fear for her personal safety,\u201d the lawyer, Katie Wright Morrone, wrote, according to a copy of the letter sent to the home of Sweeney\u2019s parents. Sweeney shared the letter with The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cWhile this may be a game to you, or an avenue that you hope will earn you wealth or fame, it is a life-or-death matter for our Client,\u201d Morrone wrote. She added that there is \u201cno legitimate interest in or public need for this information, other than to stalk, harass, and exert dominion and control.\u201d\n\nThe pop star has routinely faced stalkers showing up outside her homes, Morrone wrote, and one man now faces stalking and harassment charges after being arrested last month outside her townhouse in Manhattan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked whether Swift\u2019s representatives knew of any evidence that stalkers had used the jet-tracking accounts, Tree Paine, a spokeswoman for Swift, said, \u201cWe cannot comment on any ongoing police investigation but can confirm the timing of stalkers suggests a connection. His posts tell you exactly when and where she would be.\u201d\n\nSweeney, 21, told The Post he saw the letter as an attempt to scare him away from sharing public data. The accounts offer only an incomplete sketch of which cities Swift might currently be in, similar to the public schedules for her concerts or any NFL games she might attend, he said. And the letters, he added, were sent to him at a time when she faced criticism over her flights\u2019 environmental impact.\n\n\u201cThis information is already out there,\u201d he said. \u201cHer team thinks they can control the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivate-jet flights are routinely criticized for their \u201cdisproportionately high\u201d impact on climate change, and Sweeney\u2019s accounts have often been used to name and shame their most famous passengers. In 2022, the accounts were cited in an analysis that estimated Swift was the \u201cbiggest celebrity [carbon dioxide] polluter\u201d of the year.\n\nHer publicist told The Post then that the analysis was flawed because her jet was often loaned out to other people. Paine told The Post on Monday that Swift bought more than double the \u201ccarbon credits\u201d needed to offset her travel before her recent tour kicked off.\n\nAround the time of the December letter, Facebook and Instagram disabled the accounts Sweeney had created to track Swift\u2019s air travel, saying they broke the platforms\u2019 privacy rules, he said. He began posting those updates onto accounts on Facebook and Instagram that he uses to log the travel of planes used by a range of stars, called Celeb Jets. Then, last month, Morrone sent a second letter saying his posts about Swift\u2019s aircraft constituted \u201charassing conduct.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe letters included the names of three other Venable attorneys experienced in litigation, including one who says on LinkedIn that she is the founding member of the firm\u2019s \u201cDigital Crisis Planning & Response client solution\u201d and helps \u201chigh-profile individuals\u201d manage crises of varying magnitude, such as \u201ccelebrity disgrace events.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nMorrone did not respond to requests for comment. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, also did not respond.\n\nPlanes in the sky regularly broadcast their locations via transponders so air traffic controllers and other pilots can see where they\u2019re going. Anyone on the ground can pick up those signals using a cheap device, known as an ADS-B receiver, that is widely sold online.\n\nThe FAA allows plane owners to request their flights be hidden in the federal data that undergirds popular consumer flight-tracking websites, such as FlightAware. Swift\u2019s jet appears to be blocked through such a request.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut many aviation hobbyists feed their raw data into independent websites, such as ADS-B Exchange, that those FAA requests do not cover. Criminal investigators, journalists and researchers have used those sites to look up historical flight paths or see who\u2019s flying overhead.\n\nSwift, Time magazine\u2019s 2023 \u201cperson of the year,\u201d made history Sunday as the only musician to win four best-album Grammy Awards, and her every movement is closely watched by paparazzi and superfans. Her \u201cEras Tour\u201d last year was credited with boosting the local economies of every city she stopped in; one study cited by The Post estimated that \u201cSwifties\u201d spent about $93 million per show.\n\nHer travel plans have drawn increased attention in recent weeks as she\u2019s flown to watch her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, play for the Kansas City Chiefs, including from conservatives who have seized on the trips to criticize her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey have also become a key point of interest for her fans, especially because her upcoming concert in Tokyo is just hours before Kelce\u2019s scheduled Super Bowl appearance on Sunday in Las Vegas. Even Japan\u2019s embassy in Washington recognized the public\u2019s interest, posting on X last week, \u201cDespite the 12-hour flight and 17-hour time difference, the Embassy can confidently Speak Now to say that \u2026 she should comfortably arrive\u201d on time.\n\nSweeney\u2019s accounts have in recent months tracked two jets that were owned by Nashville-based companies and registered to be operated by a Swift company called Firefly Entertainment, according to FAA documents. They do not track who travels on the planes or any other chartered flights.\n\nSwift\u2019s spokeswoman told The Post that \u201cthere is only one plane.\u201d One of the planes previously tracked by Sweeney\u2019s accounts, a Dassault Falcon 900, was marked in FAA records last week as being transferred to a real estate company. Each jet sells for about $25 million, according to brokerage estimates cited last month by The Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter X banned him and his accounts in December 2022, Sweeney opened new Facebook and Instagram accounts for Swift, former president Donald Trump, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, reality star Kim Kardashian and Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg, among others. All of those accounts except for Swift\u2019s remain online \u2014 including the accounts for Zuckerberg, who runs both sites. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nSweeney continues to post Swift jet updates to other platforms, including Bluesky, Mastodon and Telegram. To abide by X\u2019s rule against real-time location tracking, he also created accounts that post Musk and Swift\u2019s flight updates with a 24-hour delay.\n\nThe December letter from Swift\u2019s attorney states that Sweeney\u2019s actions are \u201cin violation of several state laws\u201d but does not specify them. The letter does, however, cite nine anonymous Instagram comments saying the account is \u201cscary,\u201d \u201cpathetic,\u201d \u201cweird,\u201d invasive\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d \u201cstalker behavior.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe letter says Sweeney is \u201cnotorious for disregarding the personal safety of others in exchange for public attention and/or requests for financial gain\u201d and cites a message he sent to Musk in 2021, during which he countered Musk\u2019s $5,000 offer to delete the Musk-jet account with a suggestion of $50,000, as first reported by the now-defunct tech blog Protocol. Sweeney said no money was ever exchanged.\n\nAfter receiving the letters, Sweeney said he asked for help from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, which sent his request to a list of attorneys. James Slater, a Florida lawyer who specializes in First Amendment and internet speech issues, responded on Sweeney\u2019s behalf to the Venable letter.\n\nSlater wrote that Morrone had not identified any legal claim, that the jet information posed \u201cno threat\u201d to Swift\u2019s safety, and that Sweeney\u2019s account had \u201cengaged in protected speech that does not violate any of Ms. Swift\u2019s legal rights,\u201d according to a copy reviewed by The Post. Slater said he has yet to receive a response.\n\nIn an interview, Slater said he thought the Swift attorney\u2019s letters were \u201chyperbolic and unfounded\u201d and sent in hopes that Sweeney would \u201cjust delete everything and do what they said.\u201d"}

My wife is one. She\u2019s always been a whiz at school, but, as a choir teacher, she has absolutely no use for the equation (other than as an occasional party trick). The other person is my brother, who works with electron-beam technology as a mechanical engineer. He\u2019s in the minority of people who actually use advanced math daily.\n\nFor most of us, the formula was one of many alphabet soup combinations crammed into our heads in high school long enough to pass a math test, then promptly forgotten. I\u2019m queasy all over again just thinking about it. As a functioning adult in society, I have no use for imaginary numbers or the Pythagorean theorem. I\u2019ve never needed to determine the height of a flagpole by measuring its shadow and the angle of the sun.\n\nOnly 22 percent of the nation\u2019s workers use any math more advanced than fractions, and they typically occupy technical or skilled positions. That means more than three-fourths of the population spends painful years in school futzing with numbers when they could be learning something more useful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m talking about applied logic. This branch of philosophy grows from the same mental tree as algebra and geometry but lacks the distracting foliage of numbers and formulas. Call it the art of thinking clearly. We need this urgently in this era of disinformation, in which politicians and media personalities play on our emotions and fears.\n\nLogic teaches us how to trace a claim back to its underlying premises and to test each link in a chain of thought for unsupported assumptions or fallacies. People trained in logic are better able to spot the deceptions and misdirection that politicians so often employ. They also have a better appreciation for different points of view because they understand the thought processes that produce multiple legitimate conclusions concerning the same set of facts. They are comfortable with spirited dialogue about what\u2019s best for our society.\n\nI once asked my pre-calculus teacher whether I would ever use the information she taught in real life. Her answer was surprisingly frank: I probably wouldn\u2019t. The reason to take the class was to score well on the advanced placement test, which would give me a leg up on the math requirements in college. In other words, numbers for the sake of numbers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMath advocates claim to be teaching complex problem solving, mental discipline and a better understanding of our world. Logic teaches the same things more directly. Geometry can\u2019t teach me when an argument is manipulating my emotions, but logic can. Calculus doesn\u2019t help me solve moral dilemmas, but philosophy does.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAdmittedly, all students need to master the basic math of everyday life so they can manage money, compare prices, find the center of a wall to hang a picture and so on. And some students, like my brother, will fall in love with math. That\u2019s a good thing, because they will use it to make bridges safe, to predict the weather, to land spacecraft on the moon and Mars \u2014 you get the idea.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to suggest that public schools all provide a standardized core curriculum. But what makes up a fundamental education? America has not thought through this question in a national conversation since the 1983 release of \u201cA Nation At Risk.\u201d The product of a presidential commission on education, this report warned of declining achievement in the country\u2019s schools and diagnosed \u201cthe urgent need for improvement.\u201d Among its recommendations were a minimum of three years of math for all high school graduates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince that time, the digital revolution has placed massive computational power in the palm of every student\u2019s hand. Should the need for a cube root arise in someone\u2019 life, Siri is available 24/7 to provide the answer. That same revolution has given us a crisis of conspiracy theories and a polluted public discourse. What\u2019s at risk now is our ability to reason together as citizens. Skills such as these might not be able to solve for X, but they could go a long way in the pursuit of happiness and the health of America. You can\u2019t punch those things into a calculator.\n\nThe need to solve problems is eternal, but many of life\u2019s weightiest problems don\u2019t boil down to numbers. Prioritizing higher-level numeracy over other forms of logical reasoning is not turning us into a nation of engineers and physicists. It\u2019s letting us become a nation that can\u2019t think straight."}
