Delightfully, this latest edition added more such instances to the growing catalog.\n\nFrom nostalgic appearances by the likes of Joni Mitchell (who won her 10th Grammy Sunday night) and Billy Joel, to standout performances from today's pop star legends such as Dua Lipa's hypnotic opening medley and Miley Cyrus' charming performance of \"Flowers\" after winning her first Grammy of her career, the 66th annual Grammy Awards show from Los Angeles' Crypto.com arena delivered an eclectic array of stellar star turns.\n\nWe take a look at some of the top moments from the night, including Taylor Swift making Grammy history and Jay-Z delivering a fiery speech.\n\nTaylor Swift makes Grammy history with 'Midnights'\n\nA seemingly shocked Taylor Swift broke a Grammy record Sunday night, taking her fourth album of the year award for \"Midnights,\" stepping out from the trio she'd left behind, Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon (who all have won album of the year three times).\n\n\"I would love to tell you that this is the best moment of my life, but \u2026 \" Instead she listed endless moments from finding a bridge to a song to heading to Japan (imminently) to continue the 2024 leg of her Eras Tour.\n\nEarlier in the night, Swift's \"Midnights\" also won a Grammy for pop vocal album. Swift noted onstage it was her lucky 13th Grammy win (\"That's my lucky number, I don't know if I told you that?\" she joked). Then to shrieks from Swifties in the crowd, the singer announced the April 19 release of a new album, \"Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nCeline Dion's surprise Grammys appearance after stiff-person syndrome diagnosis\n\nCanadian siren and bazillion album-seller Celine Dion drew a standing ovation from the crowd simply for walking out onstage. As it should be.\n\nDion, whose Las Vegas residency set countless records, has been battling stiff person syndrome and enduring the loss of her husband and longtime manager, Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil. But Sunday night, the five-time Grammy winner was brief before announcing the night's big award, album of the year (to Swift). \"Thank you all. I love you right back,\" Dion said. \"When I say that I'm happy to be here, I really mean it from my heart.\"\n\nLuke Combs, Tracy Chapman perform moving duet of 'Fast Car'\n\nA diminutive Tracy Chapman, with grey streaked hair, plucked her acoustic guitar and country superstar Luke Combs, large and in charge, hit the stage to perform Chapman's 1988 hit song \"Fast Car.\" The duo traded verses, and time seemed suspended as Combs looked like a child living his dream singing next to Chapman.\n\nStars in attendance, including Swift and Oprah, stood up to sing and dance along to the classic tune. While some music grabs you by the throat, this song tears at your heart. The song concluded, Combs bowed to Chapman and the two embraced onstage.\n\nIn a pre-recorded segment, Combs said Chapman's tune, which she released at just 24, became his first favorite song as a young boy. A tune that, 35 years after its debut, nabbed a Country Music Award this year thanks to Combs turning it into a concert sing-along favorite. It was also the first such win for a Black woman.\n\nAnnie Lennox calls for Gaza ceasefire during Sinead O'Connor tribute\n\nOscars, take note. The Grammys just showed you how \"In Memoriam\" segments are done. Sunday night's comprehensive \"In Memoriam\" paid tribute to scores of music industry veterans, starting with a heartfelt tribute to Tony Bennett by Stevie Wonder. Seated at his piano, Wonder first sang \"For Once in My Life\" alongside an archival video of Bennett singing, then performed the late icon's \"The Best Is Yet to Come.\"\n\nAnnie Lennox then took the stage, her left eye featuring a long make-up teardrop, as a photo of Sinead O'Connor appeared behind her. As her rendition of O'Connor's indelible \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" ended, Lennox called for a ceasefire in Gaza with her first in the air. \"Artists for a ceasefire. Peace in the world!\"\n\nJon Batiste, along with singer Ann Nesby, did their best to conjure the ghost of Bill Withers with a medley of hits. Oprah also hit the stage as the strains of Tina Turner's classic \"Proud Mary\" filled the air to introduce Fantasia Barrino, who delivered a powerful and graceful tribute to the late icon.\n\nRolling on a river indeed.\n\nJay-Z slams Grammys for never awarding Beyonc\u00e9 Album of the Year\n\nJay-Z, sleek in all-black, took the stage with his daughter Blue Ivy, 12, to receive this year's Dr. Dre Global Impact Award. Beyonc\u00e9, equally stunning in complementary white, beamed with pride from her table.\n\nAside from thanking the award's namesake, the hip-hop legend held no punches during his lengthy speech calling out the Grammys for never awarding his wife the album of the year award. \"We love y'all. We want y'all to get it right. At least get it close to right,\" he said. \" \u2026 I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than anyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work.\" Beyonc\u00e9 currently holds 32 Grammys to her name.\n\nJoni Mitchell's stunning first Grammys performance with Brandi Carlile\n\nJoni Mitchell first blew musical minds nearly 60 years ago, as a talented if seemingly shy genius from Canada. Mitchell, 80, wowed the arena with a touching rendition of \"Both Sides Now,\" a reflection back on life written when she was a twentysomething. Mitchell's voice may not be soaring as it once was, but the darker timber simply added more poignancy to her words.\n\nMitchell also won the Grammy for best folk album for \"Joni Mitchell at Newport.\" For her performance, alongside Brandi Carlile, Mitchell appeared appropriately sitting on a throne, holding a cane. \"I've looked at life from both sides now,\" she sang. And you know she has.\n\nBill Joel performs 'Turn the Lights Back On' for first time\n\nIt was a night of firsts. Mitchell hit the Grammys stage for the first time, and Billy Joel debuted his new single, \"Turn the Lights Back On.\" Sitting at the grand piano, Joel sang, \"Please open the door \u2026\" And with that, a 30-year songwriting drought ended for the 74-year-old.\n\nWhile the new song won't be confused for one of endless rollicking Joel hits, it was a reminder that the \"Piano Man\" still has power in his fingers and voice and is still capable of creative flourishes at his age. \"Did I wait too long, to turn the lights back on?\" Joel sang. The answer to that was in the standing ovation."}

Seated at his piano, Wonder first sang \"For Once in My Life\" alongside an archival video of Bennett singing, then performed the late icon's \"The Best Is Yet to Come.\"\n\nWonder recalled first hearing Bennett singing \"For Once in My Life\" when \"I was like 13 or 14 years old,\" and released his own version of the song in 1968 when he was 18. When he got into the studio with producer Henry Cosby for a more uptempo number than had been recorded previously, songwriter Ron Miller said to Wonder, \"What are you doing to my song?!\" Later, Wonder and Bennett performed it as a duet for Bennett's 2006 album \"Duets\" and the track won won the Grammy for best pop collaboration with vocals in 2007.\n\n\"What's amazing is I was able to actually sing the song with someone that I admired for so long,\" an emotional Wonder said of working with Bennett. \"Not just because of his voice, which was incredible, but because of his love for art. His love for peace. His love for unity. His love for civil rights. Yes, I remember as a little boy him being in places where most people would not even go to stand for the right for freedom for everyone.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Wonder added, \"Tony, I'm going to miss you forever. I love you always and God bless that God allowed us to have you and have us in this time and space in our life.\"\n\nAnnie Lennox sings a Sinead O'Connor classic, Oprah Winfrey and Fantasia Barrino honor Tina Turner\n\nAfter Wonder's tribute to Bennett, there was a video snippet of Jimmy Buffett crooning \"Come Monday\" before Annie Lennox took the stage to tearfully sing Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor's \"Nothing Compares to U.\"\n\n\"Artists for ceasefire, peace in the world!\" Lennox said at the end, her first raised.\n\nAfter a Burt Bacharach video package, Jon Batiste sang \"Ain't No Sunshine,\" \"Stand by Me\" and \"Optimistic\" in a tribute to Clarence Avant, a music executive and manager dubbed the \"Black Godfather of Music\" who helped the careers of Quincy Jones, Bill Withers and others.\n\nThen finally Oprah Winfrey arrived to honor Tina Turner.\n\n\"She is our forever goddess of rock and roll, who inspired millions. A moving symbol of grace and grit, soul and power,\" Winfrey said. She called Turner \"a special kind of role model. She used to say to me, 'Oprah, you should always dress up for dinner even if no one\u2019s there, just so you feel beautiful to you, for yourself,' \" before \"The Color Purple\" star Fantasia Barrino launched into a rousing cover of \"Proud Mary.\""}

Apple's new mixed reality headset has already made its way courtside of an NBA game. Tonight's game between the Boston Celtics and Memphis Grizzlies saw one fan wearing the headset despite sitting less than ten feet from live NBA action.\n\nHas virtual reality become so ubiquitous that it's making its way to live sporting events? Maybe. The NBA and other pro sports leagues have long attempted to incorporate virtual or augmented reality into the game-watching experience. Based on the video, this fan is clearly having the time of his life. Maybe he has figured out the trick that the those leagues have been looking for.\n\nWhat is Apple Vision Pro?\n\nApple Vision Pro is a new mixed reality that combines aspects of both augmented and virtual reality to provide an interface that users can control with their hands and eyes. If you were wondering what the Celtics fan was doing with his hands in some of the videos, he was doing just that.\n\nOn Thursday, Feb. 1, Apple's vice president of worldwide developer relations Susan Prescott said \"With more than 600 new spatial experiences to explore in the all-new App Store, alongside more than 1 million compatible apps across iOS and iPadOS, users can discover a wide array of apps that expand the boundaries of what\u2019s possible.\"\n\nThe headset costs a whopping $3,499.

With Day 1 set to begin on April 25 at 8 p.m. ET, there is still lots of time for circumstances to change. However, as we approach the day where dreams become reality, there is still tons of speculation regarding who will be taken where and to which teams.\n\nCould the Chicago Bears choose to stick with Justin Fields and trade away the first overall pick for more draft capital? Could the Arizona Cardinals end up with Marvin Harrison Jr. with the fourth overall selection? With so many elite prospects filling up the 2024 draft pool, there are a million different outcomes we could expect.\n\nHere are some predictions on where the top NFL draft prospects will go.\n\nNFL mock draft 2024:Five QBs taken in top 12 picks? Prepare for a first-round frenzy.\n\nQB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nThrough thick and thin, as the world around us has changed, Caleb Williams has remained atop NFL draft boards. Even though the USC Trojans did not perform as well as many people expected, Williams played rather well and maintained position as the class's top quarterback option. Williams is such a talented prospect that experts are saying the Bears should not trade the first overall pick for a king's ransom. If that doesn't tell you just how good Williams can be, then nothing will.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nNate Davis, USA Today: Chicago Bears, 1st overall\n\nEric Edholm, NFL.com: Chicago Bears, 1st overall\n\nConnor Livesay, The 33rd Team: Chicago Bears, 1st overall\n\nJosh Edwards, CBS Sports: Chicago Bears, 1st overall\n\nQB Jayden Daniels, LSU\n\nAfter a Heisman campaign in 2023, Daniels has shot up draft boards with some projecting him to leap frog North Carolina's Drake Maye. Daniels boasts remarkable speed and surprising accuracy. While his meteoric rise may turn some teams away from Daniels, the Patriots and Commanders are both desperate for quarterbacks though, so Daniels shouldn't make it out of the top-three selections.\n\nNate Davis, USA Today: Washington Commanders, 2nd overall\n\nEric Edholm, NFL.com: New England Patriots, 3rd overall\n\nConnor Livesay, The 33rd Team: New England Patriots, 3rd overall\n\nJosh Edwards, CBS Sports: New England Patriots, 3rd overall\n\nQB Drake Maye, UNC\n\nEven though Maye ended his career with very streaky play, Maye still possesses all the tools necessary to be an incredible NFL quarterback. It would only be fitting for Maye to replace Sam Howell in Washington, just as he replaced Howell at UNC. However, there are still some people who believe the Commanders could pass on Maye for a more proven winner in Daniels.\n\nNate Davis, USA Today: New England Patriots, 3rd overall\n\nEric Edholm, NFL.com: Washington Commanders, 2nd overall\n\nConnor Livesay, The 33rd Team: Washington Commanders, 2nd overall\n\nJosh Edwards, CBS Sports: Washington Commanders, 2nd overall\n\nData crunch:Take it from Jimmy Johnson: NFL coaches who rely too much on analytics play risky game\n\nWR Marvin Harrison Jr., Ohio St.\n\nArguably the greatest wide receiver prospect this century, Harrison would be the first overall pick in any other draft class. Unfortunately for him, there are three great quarterback prospects ahead of him on most mock drafts. Fortunately for Arizona Cardinals fans though, Harrison could fall straight into their laps without having to make any trades.\n\nNate Davis, USA Today: Arizona Cardinals, 4th overall\n\nEric Edholm, NFL.com: Arizona Cardinals, 4th overall\n\nConnor Livesay, The 33rd Team: Arizona Cardinals, 4th overall\n\nJosh Edwards, CBS Sports: Arizona Cardinals, 4th overall\n\nWR Malik Nabers, LSU\n\nWhile the New York Giants have already drafted a few receivers as downfield threats, Nabers would be the most complete player in that wide receiver room almost instantly. Nabers' remarkable ability to create space and game-breaking speed would be a breath of fresh air for a Giants' offense that hasn't had a reliable option on the outside in years.\n\nNate Davis, USA Today: New York Giants, 6th overall\n\nEric Edholm, NFL.com: New York Giants, 6th overall\n\nConnor Livesay, The 33rd Team: New York Giants, 6th overall\n\nJosh Edwards, CBS Sports: New York Giants, 6th overall\n\nWR Rome Odunze, Washington\n\nOne of the most well-rounded receivers in this year's class, Odunze is projected to be a great option right away. Most mock drafts have Odunze going to either the Los Angeles Chargers or Chicago Bears. Either way, Odunze would make either wide receiver group instantly elite. Whether he's paired with Keenan Allen or DJ Moore, Odunze will be put in a position to complete a dominant 1-2 receiver duo.\n\nNate Davis, USA Today: Los Angeles Chargers, 5th overall\n\nEric Edholm, NFL.com: Chicago Bears, 9th overall\n\nConnor Livesay, The 33rd Team: Chicago Bears, 9th overall\n\nJosh Edwards, CBS Sports: Chicago Bears, 9th overall\n\nSuperior bowls:Ranking all 57 Super Bowls from best to worst: How does first Chiefs-49ers clash rate?\n\nOT Joe Alt, Notre Dame\n\nThe Tennessee Titans have had a massive hole at left tackle ever since injuries decimated Taylor Lewan's career, making Joe Alt a no-brainer if he's available at seven. Although the Titans could opt to go for a receiver seeing as how they'll likely lean less on Derrick Henry moving forward, Alt makes too much sense as someone the team could plug into the offensive line instantly and can protect their franchise quarterback Will Levis.\n\nNate Davis, USA Today: Tennessee Titans, 7th overall\n\nEric Edholm, NFL.com: Tennessee Titans, 7th overall\n\nConnor Livesay, The 33rd Team: Tennessee Titans, 7th overall\n\nJosh Edwards, CBS Sports: Tennessee Titans, 7th overall\n\nOT Olumuyiwa Fashanu, Penn St.\n\nWidely regarded as the second-best tackle option behind Alt, Fashanu should be a slam dunk for the Jets who just witnessed Aaron Rodgers sit on their sidelines for his entire first season with the team. There is a chance the team goes receiver or tight end (only if Bowers is available) in order to give Rodgers another weapon to throw to, but tackle is a huge need and Rodgers is 40 years old.\n\nNate Davis, USA Today: Jacksonville Jaguars, 17th overall\n\nEric Edholm, NFL.com: New Orleans Saints, 14th overall\n\nConnor Livesay, The 33rd Team: New York Jets, 10th overall\n\nJosh Edwards, CBS Sports: New York Jets, 10th overall\n\nTE Brock Bowers, Georgia\n\nThe greatest tight end prospect since Kyle Pitts, Bowers would be a great get for any team within the top-ten picks (yes, even Atlanta). With Jim Harbaugh stepping in as the new head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, Bowers could be the apple of his eye as Harbaugh has leaned on stellar tight end play for most of his coaching career. Harbaugh leaned heavily on Vernon Davis during his time as the San Francisco 49ers head coach. He leaned heavily on tight ends throughout his years at Michigan. If not the Chargers though, Bowers could fall to the end of the top-ten picks.\n\nNate Davis, USA Today: New York Jets, 10th overall\n\nEric Edholm, NFL.com: Los Angeles Chargers, 5th overall\n\nConnor Livesay, The 33rd Team: Los Angeles Chargers, 5th overall\n\nJosh Edwards, CBS Sports: Los Angeles Chargers, 5th overall\n\nQB J.J. McCarthy, Michigan\n\nDespite not ever being the focal point of his offense at Michigan, former head coach Jim Harbaugh has gone to bat hard for his former quarterback putting the NFL on notice, claiming that fans shouldn't be surprised when he gets drafted within as the top quarterback. That would be quite the change and it's very, very unlikely to happen. In fact, very few people project that McCarthy will even go in the top-ten.\n\nNate Davis, USA Today: Minnesota Vikings, 11th overall\n\nEric Edholm, NFL.com: Los Angeles Rams, 19th overall\n\nConnor Livesay, The 33rd Team: Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 26th overall\n\nJosh Edwards, CBS Sports: Minnesota Vikings, 27th overall"}

Before Embiid\u2019s injury, he was in danger of not playing in 65 games amid an MVP-caliber season. The surgery and subsequent missed games will take him out of the MVP discussion."}

It was the most memorable moment of the rapper\u2019s \u201cMad Max\u201d-style medley, which was otherwise bogged down by murky visuals.\n\n10. Burna Boy featuring 21 Savage and Brandy \u201cOn Form,\u201d \u201cCity Boys,\u201d \u201cSittin\u2019 on Top of the World\u201d\n\nBurna Boy oozed charisma as he ran through an infectious medley of hits with rapper 21 Savage and R&B chanteuse Brandy, accompanied by a vibrant ensemble of backup dancers and musicians. As the awards show dragged into its interminable third hour, the Nigerian singer was a much-needed dose of adrenaline.\n\n9. Dua Lipa \"Training Season,\" \"Dance the Night,\" \"Houdini\"\n\nThe British pop sensation gave us everything Sunday night, opening the show with a red-hot, leather-and-latex-clad medley of hits \u201cDance the Night\u201d and \u201cHoudini,\u201d along with teasing her sultry upcoming single \u201cTraining Session.\u201d For any keyboard warriors still insisting that Lipa can\u2019t dance, the singer put criticisms to bed with her athletic performance: hanging off a rotating cage and sliding across the floor against a dizzying backdrop of mirrors and pyrotechnics.\n\n8. Billy Joel \u201cTurn the Lights Back On\u201d\n\nThe Piano Man deserved better. The legendary Joel closed out the telecast with wistful new track \u201cTurn the Lights Back On,\u201d along with his rollicking 1980 single \u201cYou May Be Right.\u201d But the performances were unfairly sandwiched in between top awards for Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift at the end of the night, with many audience members seen filing out during his second song. What should\u2019ve been a highlight of this year\u2019s awards felt more like an afterthought, at least in the eyes of the Recording Academy.\n\n7. Olivia Rodrigo \u201cVampire\u201d\n\nRodrigo brought \u201cCarrie\u201d to the Grammys telecast with a blood-soaked performance of her piercing single \u201cVampire.\u201d Despite a shaky vocal start, the pop-punk hitmaker swiftly recovered as she belted out the dramatic number dressed in a plunging crimson gown and smearing blood across her face while guts spilled from the flower backdrop behind her.\n\n6. Fantasia Barrino \u201cProud Mary\u201d\n\nAfter a touching tribute to the late Tony Bennett by his friend Stevie Wonder, Annie Lennox commanded the stage with a staggering take on \u201cNothing Compares 2 U,\u201d calling for a ceasefire as she honored Sinead O\u2019Connor with the Prince standard. Barrino, who auditioned for \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d with Tina Turner\u2019s \u201cProud Mary,\u201d closed out the \u201cin memoriam\u201d segment with an electrifying spin on the song shaking her hips with Dua Lipa as she ran through the rousing blues anthem.\n\n5. SZA \u201cSnooze,\u201d \u201cKill Bill\u201d\n\nSZA brought cinematic excellence to this year\u2019s Grammys, donning a \u201cMatrix\u201d-style trench coat and wide-brimmed hat for the bewitching \u201cSnooze,\u201d flanked by overturned trash cans and burning dumpsters. But the performance really came alive when she moved into smash single \u201cKill Bill,\u201d paying spectacular homage to the 2003 Quentin Tarantino film with sword-wielding dancers and acrobatic choreography, even \u201cthrowing\u201d a man into the air in a delightful bit of stage magic.\n\n4. Billie Eilish \"What Was I Made For?\"\n\nEilish stunned in a pink headscarf and green dress, recreating a 1965 vintage Barbie look that she teased on her Instagram early Sunday. Accompanied by her brother Finneas on piano, the 22-year-old delivered an elegant and haunting rendition of her Oscar-nominated \u201cBarbie\u201d ballad, which grapples with depression and self-worth. Ever since her career exploded five years ago, Eilish quickly established herself as one of our most reliably captivating live performers, and her gorgeous showing Sunday was no exception.\n\n3. Miley Cyrus \"Flowers\"\n\nKeeping with the night\u2019s theme of \u201cless is more,\u201d Cyrus brought old-school glamor to her first televised performance of the chart-topping \u201cFlowers,\u201d joyfully dancing in place and shimmying across the stage as she showed off the gravelly and glorious power of her voice. \u201cWhy are you acting like you don\u2019t know this song?\u201d Cyrus asked mid-verse, inspiring audience members including Chrissy Teigen and Kylie Minogue to dance at their tables. The dynamic singer effortlessly channeled Tina Turner with a silver-tassel dress and hair teased sky high, throwing down her microphone in a \u201cProud Mary\u201d-style encore.\n\n2. Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs \"Fast Car\"\n\nThe Grammys\u2019 worst-kept secret also proved to be one of the best moments of the night. After days of speculation that Chapman would join Combs onstage to play her classic 1988 song, the folk singer made a rare appearance at Sunday\u2019s show for a simple yet deeply affecting performance. Dressed down in jeans and a black button-up, Chapman played acoustic guitar and graciously traded verses with the gruff country vocalist, smiling at each other as nominees Taylor Swift and Brandi Carlile looked on lovingly from the crowd.\n\n1. Joni Mitchell \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d\n\nNearly a decade after suffering a brain aneurysm, Mitchell, 80, made her triumphant debut Grammys performance seated in a satin armchair and surrounded by chandeliers as she gently sang her signature tune, \u201cBoth Sides Now.\u201d Her delivery was delicate yet matter of fact. She brought A-list attendees Beyonc\u00e9 and Meryl Streep to tears, as she harmonized beautifully with backup vocalist Brandi Carlile, her longtime friend. It was a stirring performance of an all-time great song \u2013 one that will go down as one of the very best moments in Grammys history."}

Her latest album, \"Endless Summer Vacation,\" earned nods for best pop vocal album and album of the year, as well as best pop duo/group performance for \"Thousand Miles\" and best pop solo performance, song of the year and record of the year for \"Flowers.\"\n\nCyrus reacted to her nominations in an Instagram post in November, writing, \"It's fun to be nominated & exciting to win but having my music LOVED around the world is the real trophy.\"\n\nAlluding to the fact that the Grammys' top categories this year were almost entirely dominated by women, she also said, \"Watching women rule the music industry makes me proud.\"\n\nCyrus' first Grammy nomination came in 2015 for her fourth album, \"Bangerz,\" which competed for best pop vocal album. At the time, she told Entertainment Tonight when she heard she had been nominated, she was so surprised she thought it was a joke. \"I was like, 'You're kidding ... there's no way,'\" she said. \"I googled and I was like 'oh yeah! I am, I actually am!'\" That award ultimately went to Sam Smith for \"In the Lonely Hour.\"\n\nCyrus didn't receive another Grammy nomination until 2022 when Lil Nas X's \"Montero\" was up for album of the year. This earned Cyrus a nomination, as she was featured on the track \"Am I Dreaming.\"\n\n\"Flowers\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart in January 2023, marking the pop star's second song to top that chart after \"Wrecking Ball\" in 2013. That March, \"Endless Summer Vacation\" debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Her previous album, \"Plastic Hearts,\" debuted at No. 2 on the chart in 2020 but received no Grammy nominations.\n\nThough this was Cyrus' first time being recognized with a Grammy, she has previously collected trophies from the MTV Video Music Awards and the Billboard Music Awards. Other artists who have still never won a competitive Grammy Award include Diana Ross, Katy Perry and Snoop Dogg."}

Here's what it means.", "domain": "usatoday.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMI7D-wowkqT0Ag", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Lawmakers on Sunday revealed a $118 billion package that includes a long-awaited bipartisan deal to address the migrant crisis at the southern border and new aid for Ukraine, Israel, and other U.S. allies, embarking on a challenging path forward in the House where Republican leadership quickly panned it.\n\nReports about the agreement have swirled for months, and the text of the bill being released will allow leaders \u2013 including those Republicans who have already sworn off the proposal \u2013 to evaluate the legislation for themselves.\n\nThe 370-page bill includes the supplemental aid package requested by President Joe Biden for foreign conflicts, which would appropriate $60 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel, and $10 billion for humanitarian aid, including in Gaza.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he plans to begin the process of considering the legislation this week as \"the overwhelming majority of Senators want to get this done.\" But the agreement has already faced sharp criticism from former President Donald Trump and other GOP leaders, and its odds of passing in Congress aren't clear.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday evening that the bill is \"even worse than expected\" and said it will be \"dead on arrival\" if it reached the House. Even some Republican senators immediately slammed it: Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said, \"I cannot understand how any Republican would think this was a good idea.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIn a call with reporters, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., urged his colleagues to consider it before passing judgment. \"Why don't we actually work through the process to see what (lawmakers) actually step out and say they do support this?\" he said.\n\nIn a statement released Sunday night, Biden said it is the \"toughest and fairest set of border reforms in decades\" and that he strongly supports it. Schumer called it a \"monumental step\" and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said it includes \"direct and immediate solutions\" and called upon the Senate to \"carefully consider the opportunity in front of us and prepare to act.\"\n\nAs Americans on both sides of the aisle call on lawmakers to compromise on solutions for the southern border, here's what you need to know about the Senate's deal.\n\nWhat's in the Senate's border agreement?\n\nThe proposal would expand detention capacity and make it harder for people to qualify for asylum but would allow migrants who can claim credible fear to stay in the country and work.\n\nIt includes around $20 billion in additional funding to expand the Department of Homeland Security's ability to catch, process, house, and transport migrants and to catch people smuggling fentanyl and other narcotics across the border. The plan also makes it easier for multiple DHS agencies to hire additional employees.\n\nThe legislation would end a practice known as \"catch and release,\" in which migrants caught crossing the border illegally are released into the United States while they wait for the government to process their asylum application. Instead, they would be detained while their claims are evaluated. It would also create a new, voluntary program for migrants to fly back to their home countries on commercial airlines paid for by the U.S. government.\n\nThe deal would expand the number of green card-eligible visas every year for the next five years and guarantee that children of H1-B visa holders remain eligible for green cards once they turn 18. It includes a pathway to citizenship for Afghans who left their country after the Taliban took over \u2013 a version of the Afghan Adjustment Act.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial element of the bill is a three-year policy to shut down the processing of asylum applications from people who crossed illegally if the number of expulsions and apprehensions of migrants reaches a week-long average of 4,000. It would create a mandated shutdown after a week-long average of 5,000 or more.\n\nThere were 302,034 encounters at the southern border in December, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection \u2013 an average of 9,743 per day.\n\nDuring the time the border is shut down, migrants caught crossing illegally would be immediately deported. The process would still allow the processing of asylum claims from people who try to enter at official ports of entry. The border would also reopen after illegal border crossings slow to 75% of that trigger number, or after 270 days have passed in the first year, 225 days in the next, and 180 days in the third year.\n\n\"That'll be one that we'll have to talk about,\" Sen. John Lankford, R-Okla., the lead GOP negotiator on the bill, told reporters Thursday on what element of the deal he expects to receive the most criticism.\n\n\"The process is really set up to be able to process more people faster, make decisions faster, deport faster,\" he said. \"But when the system gets overwhelmed, everyone gets deported until we get caught up.\"\n\nIs the southern border secure?'No, it's not,' President Biden says\n\nOpposition from the House GOP \u2013 and Hispanic lawmakers\n\nNegotiators have been debating the contents of the package for months. Originally, Republicans demanded border security legislation in exchange for their support for additional aid for Ukraine, as GOP lawmakers have split on providing additional U.S. assistance to the war-torn country.\n\nBut as the 2024 election cycle picked up speed, Trump began putting pressure on House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other Republicans in Congress to reject the deal. Even Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., \u2013 no friend of Trump's \u2013 reportedly acknowledged that the former president was planning to make border security a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign.\n\n\"We don\u2019t want to do anything to undermine him,\" McConnell told his fellow Republican senators during a closed-door lunch, according to reporting by Punchbowl, though he clarified in a later meeting he's not backing away from border legislation.\n\nDespite facing pushback from within his party, Biden has ramped up his support for the package in response. He vowed to take immediate action to \"shut down\" the southern border if Congress approves the package, which he said lawmakers would pass \"if they're serious about the border crisis.\"\n\nJohnson has told fellow Republicans in the House that the package is \"dead on arrival.\" He has repeatedly said that Biden could stop unauthorized migration without Congress' help, though analysts say it is likely he would need additional powers to do so. The Louisiana lawmaker has also called on his colleagues in the upper chamber to take up the House's hardline border bill, known as H.R. 2, which received no Democratic support.\n\nBut it's not just House Republicans who oppose the Senate proposal: The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has slammed Biden's support for the package and argued further reform is needed to provide a safe, legal pathway to citizenship for migrants.\n\n\"I disagree with President Biden's statement that the proposed policies in the reported Senate Deal are 'fair' or that it will fix our problems on the southern border,\" the caucus's chair, Rep. Nanette Barrag\u00e1n, D-Calif., said in a statement Thursday.\n\nShe said the deal could \"make matters worse\" and \"spur more chaos\" without creating long-term solutions: \"I\u2019m afraid the current Senate deal being reported, if passed, would set back real comprehensive immigration reform for ten to fifteen years.\"\n\nWant a politics roundup every night?Sign up for USA TODAY's OnPolitics newsletter."}

Rodrigo, like others on our list, is wearing a throwback or archival look. Hers is Versace from 1995. Channeling old Hollywood, Rodrigo wore her hair in soft waves with a bold red glossy lip.\n\nCoi Leray\n\nFar from playing it coy, rapper/singer Coi Leray showed exactly why \"Girls Is Players Too.\"\n\nThe black, archival bodysuit designed by YSL highlighted her legs and gave off a sultry, edgy look. Leray paired the sexy look with a fuzzy lime jacket, creating balance to the all-black ensemble.\n\nJon Batiste\n\nSometimes what glitters is silver.\n\nJon Batiste, who previously won album of the year with \"We Are,\" walked the carpet in a nickel-colored jacket paired with matching pants worn beneath a pleated skirt. A fresh take on formalwear from a man is always music to our ears.\n\nDua Lipa\n\nDua Lipa is a pop star, but turned to heavy metal when it came to her fashion look.\n\nThe \"Dance the Night\" artist shined in a metallic floor-length gown by Courr\u00e8ges with cutouts at her hips. To pull the look together, Lipa accessorized the look with an aquatic-themed Tiffany & Co. necklace and bracelet, making her outfit stand out that much more.\n\nCoco Jones\n\nCoco Jones, one of the evening's nominees for best new artist, looked like a million bucks \u2014 or whatever Uncle Phil's credit limit is.\n\nJones, who stars as Hilary Banks on Peacock's drama \"Bel-Air,\" highlighted her hourglass figure in a form-hugging Celia Kritharioti dress. She accented the sparkly aqua frock with a delicate body chain.\n\nAlessandra Ambrosio\n\nWe celebrate Alessandra Ambrosio for having a little fun on the carpet!\n\nThe model's snug silver mermaid gown, designed by Avellano, featured ample fabric sprouting at the bottom and spilling onto the red carpet. The simple yet striking silhouette was as unexpected as it was refreshing, on this year's Grammys red carpet at least."}

And Maria Sharapova eased him away from throwing a few more.\n\nBut the tennis legends were no match for the sport\u2019s most popular couple.\n\nAndre Agassi and Steffi Graf defeated McEnroe and Sharapova to win a $1 million purse in Pickleball Slam 2, which was broadcast in primetime on ESPN at the Seminole Hard Rock Casino on Sunday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we got some good ideas,\u201d Graf told USA TODAY Sports when asked about their plans for the winnings.\n\nThe four former world No. 1s, who combined for 42 Grand Slam singles titles in tennis, embraced the stage in pickleball, one of the fastest growing sports in the country.\n\nAgassi and McEnroe starred in the event last year with former tennis pros Andy Roddick and Michael Chang.\n\nBut the additions of Graf, Sharapova and former tennis players turned pickleballers Jack Sock and James Blake expanded the event\u2019s range with an effort to bridge the passionate divide between the sports.\n\n\u201cTo me, tennis is always the king. But it\u2019s easy to play this. That\u2019s why my friends play with me all the time,\u201d McEnroe said of pickleball. \u201cBut the better the level [of competition], you better practice.\u201d\n\nAdded Agassi: \u201cThe sports themselves, they can live and play happily in the sandbox. There\u2019s no reason why a tennis player can\u2019t have a paddle in their bag and pull it out at any time. Courts are everywhere now, and I think that\u2019s less and less.\u201d\n\nAgassi and Sock, who plays professionally in Major League Pickleball, won the first match against McEnroe and Blake, a team owner of the MLP\u2019s Milwaukee Mashers, 11-7, 9-11, 11-8. Graf and Sock won the second match against Sharapova and Blake 9-11, 11-8, 17-15.\n\nAgassi and Graf won the third and final match 11-7, 13-11 to sweep the event.\n\nMcEnroe says he prefers singles matches in pickleball for a better workout, while he felt exposed with doubles matches with dink shots \u2013 returns closer to the net which require players to lower their bodies to make contact.\n\nMcEnroe only slammed his paddle to the ground twice during the event in patented frustration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably more frustrated, but I am getting older,\u201d McEnroe said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m trying to come up with something new, you know?\u201d\n\nGraf said she\u2019s been playing pickleball \u201cseriously\u201d for about six months with Agassi, who picked up the sport more frequently after last year\u2019s event.\n\nDespite being the most accomplished player in her house, Graf said she felt some nervous jitters before the event.\n\n\u201cBefore we started, I had a lot of nerves and I haven\u2019t felt that way in many years,\u201d said Graf, who retired in 1999 with 107 singles titles. \u201cIt\u2019s a great crowd and it\u2019s really special.\u201d\n\nThere will be three matches:\n\n\u220e Match 1: Agassi, Sock win first match against McEnroe and Blake 11-7, 9-11, 11-8\n\n\u220e Match 2: Graf and Sock win the second match against Sharapova, Blake 9-11, 11-8, 17-15.\n\n\u220e Match 3: Agassi and Graf won the third and final match 11-7, 13-11 to win the event over McEnroe and Sharapova.\n\nGraf and Sock win the second match against Sharapova, Blake 9-11, 11-8, 17-15\n\nTeam Agassi is up 2-0. But the final match is worth two points. Next up are the four tennis legends.\n\nGraf and Sock stormed back down 10-7, to win the final set 17-15.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun. Before we started I had a lot of nerves and I haven\u2019t felt that in many years,\u201d Graf said after the match. \u201cIt\u2019s a great crowd and it\u2019s really special.\u201d\n\nAgassi, Sock win first match against McEnroe and Blake 11-7, 9-11, 11-8\n\nAgassi\u2019s side is up 1-0 on the event after a win in the first match. And he didn\u2019t pass up an opportunity to poke fun of McEnroe post match.\n\n\u201cYou know he's gotten definitely more comfortable. He just has to stop hating on Pickleball. He\u2019s going to improve dramatically,\u201d Agassi said of McEnroe.\n\nDuring the same interview, Sock said this event helps bridge the negativity between tennis and pickleball because \u201cthere\u2019s room for both and they\u2019re both amazing in their own way.\u201d\n\nJohn McEnroe slams his paddle on first point loss\n\nMcEnroe didn\u2019t waste any time making his presence felt on Sunday, slamming his paddle after he and Blake lost the first point in the first match. Then, McEnroe was upset at his first foot fault.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t challenge the foot call?!\u201d McEnroe yelled.\n\nThe referee then told McEnroe \u201cwe can trade places if you want to.\u201d\n\nWhen explaining the point system before play even began, the referee told McEnroe: \u201cI\u2019ll hold your hand the entire match, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nWhat are foot faults in pickleball?\n\nPlayers are not allowed to step into the squared off area closest to the net where they can commit foot faults. The area is called the non-volley zone, also known as the kitchen, on the pickleball courts.\n\nScoring at the Pickleball Slam\n\nThe first match will be scored in pro-legend doubles format: Rally scoring (every point counts), best two out of three games to 11 points, win by 2.\n\nThe second and final matches will be mixed doubles format: Rally scoring (every point counts), best two out of three games to 21, win by 2.\n\nWho won Pickleball Slam 1?\n\nAgassi and Andy Roddick earned a $1 million purse after beating McEnroe and Michael Chang in a winner-take-all doubles match 21-15, 21-23, 12-10."}

With fair access to literature under political attack, bookstores are a bulwark against censorship and an asset to the communities they serve.\n\nEach week we profile an independent bookstore, discovering what makes each one special and getting their expert book recommendations.\n\nThis week we have Neighborhood Reads in Washington, Missouri!\n\nWhat\u2019s your store\u2019s story?\n\nNeighborhood Reads owner Dawn Kitchell co-founded a program 22 years ago to deliver new, quality hardback books to her local schools every month. That makes 136 books a year to every school (40+) in the area. She created reading programs and invited authors to her community and hoped that someone would open a bookstore to complement these efforts. Finally, after 15 years of waiting, she decided to open the bookstore herself.\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\nShe bought a 120-year-old house, renovated it, established a Foundation, and opened Neighborhood Reads in June 2017 with a mission to keep her community reading. Neighborhood Reads, with its sister Community Literacy Foundation, continues the Book Buddy project, connecting children in Washington and the surrounding communities with beautiful new books in their school libraries and in their bookstore! Children's books inspired our founding, but Neighborhood Reads is filled with new books for all ages and interests, as well as gifts for everyone.\n\nWhat makes your independent bookstore unique?\n\nNeighborhood Reads is located in an adorable historic neighborhood in Downtown Washington, Missouri, and we're pretty sure it's one of the cutest bookstores. Washington sits on the Missouri River and is about an hour west of St. Louis. We have a giant Dawn Redwood tree in the backyard, and every Saturday morning in the spring, summer and fall you'll find us sharing stories underneath it. Our customers' favorite thing about our store is Benji, our lovable Goldendoodle who loves books (and kids). Our bookstore is a gathering place and we work hard to keep our community reading with a curated inventory, lots of community programs, and outreach.\n\nWhat book do you love to recommend to customers and why?\n\nOur favorite book to recommend to customers is \"Read to Your Baby Every Day: 30 Classic Nursery Rhymes to Read Aloud\" by Chloe Giordano and Rachel Williams. It's the first book in the Stitched Storytime series. Nursery rhymes aren't as well-known today, and this is a beautiful book to introduce young families to classic nursery rhymes.\n\nWhat book do you think deserves more attention and why?\n\nSo many picture books! Honestly, picture books are works of art and should be appreciated and enjoyed by all ages. There are so many good picture books with incredible storytelling and beautiful illustrations and it's so frustrating when these treasures sit on the shelf undiscovered! Recently, I wish folks would discover \"How Do You Spell Unfair? MacNolia Cox and the National Spelling Bee\" by Carole Boston Weatherford (author) and Frank Morrison (illustrator). The new release I'm loving is Lisa Papp's \"Madeline Finn and the Blessing of the Animals.\"\n\nWhat books/series are you most excited about coming out in the next few months?\n\nI'm excited about the release of Peter Brown's \"The Wild Robot Protects.\" We're sending Sophie Blackall's \"If I was a Horse\" to schools in November, along with \"Stickler Loves the World\" by Lane Smith and Kate DiCamillo's \"The Puppets of Spelhorst.\"\n\nWhy is shopping at local, independent bookstores important?\n\nWe had a young man come into the bookstore recently. He said he had just started reading books. I asked him what inspired him to do that, and he said his mental health. He spent all of his time scrolling his phone and it was having a negative effect on his mental health, so recently he decided to set his phone aside and read a book. He couldn't believe how good it felt, so he was looking for his next book.\n\nHe didn't know we had a bookstore in our community, but he found us. He knew what he was after, but asked for a few recommendations and pre-ordered one of my suggestions. Every aspect of that interaction is why local bookstores are important. Most importantly, this young man found our bookstore and had a place to share what he was going through. Human, one-on-one interaction. Then, there's the magic of books. We all know what that is.\n\nWhat are some of your store's events, programs, or partnerships coming up this quarter that you would like to share?\n\nWe had an amazing summer reading program and we're still riding the high of that! We created a game called Reader Land and had hundreds of people of all ages participating. It was incredible.\n\nWe just had our second Grown-Up Book Fair off-site at a local winery \u2014 it appeals to a younger crowd, which is wonderful. October 14 we hosted our annual Run to Read 5K Walk/Run/Story Stroll in partnership with our Foundation and welcoming author Lesley Kimmelman to share her picture book \"Ready, Set, Run! The Amazing New York City Marathon.\" The timing was just perfect because the 2023 NYC Marathon was Nov. 5."}

The AFC was outscored by a margin of 19-6 in the final quarter and a half, even though the AFC ended up winning the flag football game, 50-34.\n\nThe result is also a nice little payday for the NFC players, each of whom takes home a bonus of $80,000 \u2014 as opposed to the AFC players, who bring in half of that. The entire event started Thursday and was held in Orlando, Florida, with the flag football game and some of the final events on Sunday held in Camping World Stadium.\n\nHere are the winners and losers from the Pro Bowl Games.\n\nWINNERS\n\nThe fun level for the players comes through\n\nWhatever your thoughts may be on the format, it\u2019s clear that the players enjoyed the experience, even in the other events. A perfect example came early in Sunday\u2019s flag football game. NFC starting quarterback Jalen Hurts (Eagles) fired a quick pass to Cowboys receiver CeeDee Lamb, who was met with a charging AFC cornerback. As Lamb escaped, Hurts had leaked out to the left side of the field on a wheel route, where Lamb threw a perfectly-placed ball for Hurts. Hurts mistimed his jump and the pass slipped through his outstretched hands as he tumbled to the turf. Hurts, Lamb, NFC coach Eli Manning and most players on the field immediately laughed, in what made for a nice moment on the broadcast.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nWhile the viewing experience perhaps remains a little disjointed, the Pro Bowl should be a reward for the players who earned their nominations. At the very least, that experience came through.\n\nCeeDee Lamb and Keenan Allen\n\nIt\u2019s hard to extrapolate any conclusions actually pertaining to football, but a pair of receivers \u2014 one from each conference \u2014 each had nice showings in the flag football game. For the NFC, Lamb hauled in five catches for 44 yards with a team-high three receiving touchdowns.\n\nFor the AFC, Keenan Allen also had three receiving scores, but also had a passing touchdown on a 7-yard trick play to Jaguars tight end Evan Engram and led the AFC in both catches (nine) and receiving yards (90).\n\nMic\u2019ed up\n\nThis is arguably the best thing about the entire slate of programming, the access to sound and conversations between players and coaches, as well as in-game sideline interviews. The ability to hear play calls as they come in, the play calls being relayed to players in the huddle and all the little strategy adjustments through the course of the game make for fascinating little glimpses that satisfy even the most old-fashioned football fans.\n\nNFC dominates skills challenges\n\nGive credit to the NFC for being far more focused on the skills competitions throughout the entire weekend. The NFC absolutely controlled, winning all but one skills competition event, the kick tic-tac-toe. In all, the NFC outscored the AFC, 30-9, in all the skills competitions, making it the primary reason the NFC won the entire event.\n\nThe gridiron gauntlet obstacle course event\n\nThis continues to be one of the better events in the Pro Bowl games. There\u2019s a child-like simplicity to this relay-style game that recalls the nostalgia of early 90s game shows like \"American Gladiators.\" It blends agility and strength events like footwork challenges and sled pushes. The AFC and NFC compete side-by-side and the variety of the events and relay nature of the competition lends itself to tight, dramatic finishes.\n\nLOSERS\n\nThe best catch event\n\nJust like last year, this was easily the most disappointing and underwhelming event. It was a previously recorded event shown on tape delay. It only featured two players, one from each conference and there was no buildup, erasing any hope of tension or drama. And while it\u2019s an event perhaps trying to simulate the NBA\u2019s Slam Dunk Contest, it just does not create very much interest or excitement. It needs to be completely reimagined.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for someone other than the Mannings\n\nFor the second year in a row, the Manning brothers coached both Pro Bowl teams, Peyton for the AFC and Eli for the NFC. The Mannings, even in retirement, have become fixtures in the NFL season, with their endorsements and presence on the ESPN ManningCast show during \"Monday Night Football.\" They are very skilled at being on camera for funny soundbites, but we\u2019re at the point where Manning fatigue might be setting in.\n\nIf we may offer a couple of suggestions: former Seahawk great Marshawn Lynch for the NFC and former journeyman quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick for the AFC, both of whom have done plenty of media and would inject freshness into the Pro Bowl.\n\nGeno Smith\n\nAgain, it\u2019s difficult to extrapolate any actual football conclusions from the Pro Bowl, but Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith easily had the worst day of any player. Smith completed 15-of-21 passes for 154 yards with a pair of touchdowns, but he also threw three interceptions \u2014 a game high. One of those picks came on a fourth-and-goal and directly took points off the board. His QB rating of 84.3 was lower than Keenan Allen\u2019s was for the AFC, 135.4. Allen, of course, is a receiver for the Chargers.\n\nNow, getting all that out of the way, it\u2019s important to remember here that the pace of play is more akin to a walkthrough practice, only with some competition. In the grand scheme of things, it really doesn\u2019t matter much at all."}

She tapped her cane in rhythm with the song and smiled as the audience showered her with a deserving ovation.\n\nAs Carlile said in her introuction, \"(Joni) redefined the purpose of a song to reflect the contents of a person's soul.\"\n\nMitchell's latest Grammy \u2014 best folk album \u2014 was accepted during the pre-show for her live album, \"Joni Mitchell at Newport,\" with Carlile by her side.\n\n\"We had so much fun at that concert, and I think you can feel it on the record,\" Mitchell said while accepting her award. The album marked her first public performance in 20 years after she made a surprise appearance at the 2022 event. \"It's a very joyous record because of the people I played with and the spirit of the occasion was very high and it went onto the record. Even the audience sounds like music.\"\n\nMore:Joni Mitchell adds second Hollywood Bowl concert date 'due to overwhelming demand'\n\nThe Mitchell renaissance \u2014 aided by Carlile, whom she met at Clive Davis' Pre-Grammy Gala several years ago \u2014 has been remarkable considering \"The Circle Game\" legend essentially retired following a 2015 brain aneurysm and the intensive rehabilitation it required.\n\nBut her now-famous \"Joni Jams,\" which began at her home with artists including Carlile, Marcus Mumford, Hozier and Annie Lennox, were nudged into public view last summer with a show at the Gorge Amphitheatre in Washington.\n\nMitchell also just announced a pair of \"Joni Jams\" to be held at the Hollywood Bowl Oct. 19-20, her first appearances in Los Angeles since 2000.\n\nThe revered singer-songwriter's recent live performances were preceded by a handful of accolades, including a Kennedy Center Honor in December 2021, being christened the MusiCares Person of the Year by the Recording Academy in April 2022 \u2014 where she tentatively joined Carlile, Jon Batiste and others for a few lines of \"Big Yellow Taxi\" \u2014 and earning the 2023 Gershwin Prize for Popular Song for her lifetime contributions to music."}

Star guard Caitlin Clark has captivated audiences for years with her impeccable play and \"can't lose\" attitude. Currently chasing the NCAA women's basketball all-time scoring record, she's been the center of attention every time she makes an appearance. FOX took that draw and upped it to 11 last night during Iowa's game against the Maryland Terrapins though.\n\nYes, that is an entire camera dedicated to following Clark around, streaming live on TikTok. That type of attention is only reserved for the mega, mega, mega stars like Shohei Ohtani or LeBron James. Clark has apparently reached that level of stardom as well, and she's not even a pro yet.\n\nNational superstar:Caitlin Clark is the face of women\u2019s basketball. Will she be on the 2024 Olympic team?\n\nCaitlin Clark spotlight cam\n\nWith a literal spotlight on her, Clark still performed incredibly well, dropping 38 points in the Hawkeyes' 93-85 win over Maryland. Clark did not have the most efficient performance, shooting only .448 from the field, her third-lowest percentage of any game where she scored at least 38 points. However, the only thing that matters of course, is getting the win.\n\nShe also recorded 12 assists, marking Clark's third double-double in her last five games.\n\nWhat records is Clark chasing?\n\nAfter last night's game against Maryland, Clark is just 66 points short of breaking the NCAA women's basketball's all-time scoring record, currently held by former Washington Huskies player Kelsey Plum. Plum is now a Las Vegas Ace, a two-time WNBA All-Star, and has won back-to-back championships with the team in 2022 and 2023.\n\nClark already has a multitude of records though and is chasing several others as well. Clark's 51 30-point games are the most by a Division 1 NCAA women's basketball player in the last 25 years. Her 11 40-point games are also the most by any player in that same span. While Clark does not hold the record for most career triple-doubles, she is second all-time in that category with 15. It is doubtful Clark will break that record though as it is currently held by Sabrina Ionescu with 26. Yes, Ionescu was built different.\n\nDoes Clark really deserve a whole camera?\n\nYou bet she does. Throughout the entirety of her college career, Clark has drawn record crowds. She's drawn new highs in television ratings for women's basketball, and has created numerous storylines all on her own. Finding anyone who drives the news cycle and television records like Clark has deserves anything she wants. She could turn into an ultimate diva who demands a bowl of M&M's at visiting locker rooms and the NCAA should meet those demands with an \"Anything else?\"\n\nWhen will Clark play next?\n\nThe Hawkeyes' next game is set for Thursday, Feb. 8 at 9 p.m. ET. at home against Penn State. The game will air on the Big Ten Network. The network has not announced any intention to follow in FOX's footsteps with a dedicated Clark cam.\n\nNCAAW News:Dre'una Edwards scores 15, No. 13 Baylor women beat Houston 83-60"}

The film, directed by Matthew Vaughn, managed to lead the weekend box office, but still found little interest from moviegoers.\n\nAlthough Apple has been in the original film business since 2019 and won the Oscar for best picture with 2021's \"CODA,\" the company has only recently produced its own lineup of big-budget releases. The first two \u2212 Martin Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" and Ridley Scott's \"Napoleon\" \u2212 could be called successful.\n\n\"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" though not profitable with $156 million in global sales, was one of the most celebrated films of 2023 and is nominated for 10 Academy Awards. \"Napoleon,\" released in November, has raked in $219 million worldwide, also not enough to turn a profit. But both films raised Apple's reputation as a home to top directors and prestige filmmaking.\n\nThe same can't be said for \"Argylle,\" a twisty thriller starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell and Henry Cavill. The movie was badly dinged by critics, who gave it a Rotten Tomatoes score of 35% fresh. Ticket buyers also gave it a thumbs down, with a C+ grade on CinemaScore.\n\n\"Argylle,\" with \"Kingsman\" director Vaughn at the helm, was made with aspirations of starting a new franchise. But one of its biggest talking points ahead of its release was conjecture that Taylor Swift might have been involved with the movie, thanks to the prominent presence of argyle patterns and a cat in the promotional materials.

What are parents \u2014 and teens \u2014 supposed to do in the meantime? Here are some tips on staying safe, communicating and setting limits on social media \u2014 for kids as well as their parents.\n\nIs 13 the magical age for social media?\n\nThere\u2019s already, technically, a rule that prohibits kids under 13 from using platforms that advertise to them without parental consent: The Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act that went into effect in 2000 \u2014 before today\u2019s teenagers were even born.\n\nThe goal was to protect kids\u2019 online privacy by requiring websites and online services to disclose clear privacy policies and get parents\u2019 consent before gathering personal information on their kids, among other things. To comply, social media companies have generally banned kids under 13 from signing up for their services, although it\u2019s been widely documented that kids sign up anyway, either with or without their parents\u2019 permission.\n\nBut times have changed, and online privacy is no longer the only concern when it comes to kids being online. There\u2019s bullying, harassment, the risk of developing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts or worse.\n\nFor years, there has been a push among parents, educators and tech experts to wait to give children phones \u2014 and access to social media \u2014 until they are older, such as the \u201cWait Until 8th\u201d pledge that has parents sign a pledge not to give their kids a smartphone until the 8th grade, or about age 13 or 14. Some wait even later, like 16 or 17.\n\nBut neither social media companies nor the government have done anything concrete to increase the age limit.\n\nHB1:Bill to ban minors from social media and terminate youths' accounts passes Florida House\n\nIf the law won't ban kids, should parents?\n\n\u201cThere is not necessarily a magical age,\u201d said Christine Elgersma, a social media expert at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. But, she added, \u201c13 is probably not the best age for kids to get on social media.\u201d\n\nThe laws currently being proposed include blanket bans on the under-13 set when it comes to social media. The problem? There\u2019s no easy way to verify a person\u2019s age when they sign up for apps and online services. And the apps popular with teens today were created for adults first. Companies have added some safeguards over the years, Elgersma noted, but these are piecemeal changes, not fundamental rethinks of the services.\n\n\u201cDevelopers need to start building apps with kids in mind,\u201d she said.\n\nSome tech executives, celebrities such as Jennifer Garner and parents from all walks of life have resorted to banning their kids from social media altogether. While the decision is a personal one that depends on each child and parent, some experts say this could lead to isolating kids, who could be left out of activities and discussions with friends that take place on social media or chat services.\n\nAnother hurdle \u2014 kids who have never been on social media may find themselves ill-equipped to navigate the platforms when they are suddenly allowed free rein the day they turn 18.\n\nTalk, talk, talk\n\nStart early, earlier than you think. Elgersma suggests that parents go through their own social media feeds with their children before they are old enough to be online and have open discussions on what they see. How would your child handle a situation where a friend of a friend asks them to send a photo? Or if they see an article that makes them so angry they just want to share it right away?\n\nFor older kids, approach them with curiosity and interest.\n\n\u201cIf teens are giving you the grunts or the single word answers, sometimes asking about what their friends are doing or just not asking direct questions like, \u2018What are you doing on Instagram?\u2019 but rather, \u2018Hey, I heard this influencer is really popular,\u2019\u201d she suggested. \u201cAnd even if your kid rolled their eyes it could be a window.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say things like \u201cTurn that thing off!\u201d when your kid has been scrolling for a long time, says Jean Rogers, the director of the nonprofit Fairplay\u2019s Screen Time Action Network.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not respectful,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t respect that they have a whole life and a whole world in that device.\u201d\n\nInstead, Rogers suggests asking them questions about what they do on their phone, and see what your child is willing to share.\n\nKids are also likely to respond to parents and educators \u201cpulling back the curtains\u201d on social media and the sometimes insidious tools companies use to keep people online and engaged, Elgersma said. Watch a documentary like \u201cThe Social Dilemma\u201d that explores algorithms, dark patterns and dopamine feedback cycles of social media. Or read up with them how Facebook and TikTok make money.\n\n\u201cKids love to be in the know about these things, and it will give them a sense of power,\u201d she said.\n\nSetting limits\n\nRogers says most parents have success with taking their kids\u2019 phones overnight to limit their scrolling. Occasionally kids might try to sneak the phone back, but it\u2019s a strategy that tends to work because kids need a break from the screen.\n\n\u201cThey need to an excuse with their peers to not be on their phone at night,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThey can blame their parents.\u201d\n\nParents may need their own limits on phone use. Rogers said it\u2019s helpful to explain what you are doing when you do have a phone in hand around your child so they understand you are not aimlessly scrolling through sites like Instagram. Tell your child that you\u2019re checking work email, looking up a recipe for dinner or paying a bill so they understand you\u2019re not on there just for fun. Then tell them when you plan to put the phone down.\n\nWhat about parental controls?\n\nSocial media platforms that cater to children have added an ever-growing array of parental controls as they face increasing scrutiny over child safety. For instance, Meta unveiled parental supervision tools last year that lets parents set time limits, see who their kid follows or is followed by, and allows them to track how much time the minor spends on Instagram. It does not let parents see message content.\n\nBut as with similar tools on other platforms such as TikTok, the feature is optional, and both kids and parents have to agree to use it. In order to nudge kids toward agreeing to set up the controls, Instagram sends a notice to teens after they block someone, encouraging them to let their parents \u201csupervise\u201d their account. The idea is to grab kids\u2019 attention when they might be more open to parental guidance.\n\nBy making the feature optional, Meta says it is trying to \u201cbalance teen safety and autonomy\u201d as well as prompt conversations between parents and their children.\n\nSuch features can be useful for families in which parents are already involved in their child\u2019s online life and activities. Experts say that\u2019s not the reality for many people.\n\nU.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year it\u2019s unfair to expect parents to manage what their children do with rapidly evolving technology that \u201cfundamentally changes how their kids think about themselves, how they build friendships, how they experience the world \u2014 and technology, by the way, that prior generations never had to manage.\"\n\nPutting all of that on the shoulders of parents, he said \"is just simply not fair.\u201d"}

Nikki Haley took her campaign-trail attacks on former Donald Trump over the weekend to the biggest stage yet: \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nAppearing in the opening sketch as a South Carolina voter attending a Trump town hall, Haley delivered punchlines about her rival's age and his refusal to debate her. She jabbed at what she has called \"unhinged\" statements from the Republican presidential frontrunner and suggested that he take a \"mental competency test.\"\n\n\"You spent $50 million in your own legal fees,\" Haley joked at one point to the \"SNL\" actor who typically impersonates Trump. \"Do you need to borrow some money?\u201d\n\nThe New York studio crowd whooped it up over their surprise guest.\n\n'Tricky Nikki'\n\nHaley's SNL cameo served notice to Trump of her intent to campaign aggressively in her longshot bid for an upset in the Feb. 24 presidential primary in South Carolina.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump holds a huge lead in Haley's home state and continues to dominate in national polls against his last serious GOP challenger.\n\nHaley is taking a gamble with her feistier approach. The comedy skit put her back in the spotlight after she left the campaign trail for a few days to court donors. But the attacks on Trump might backfire with GOP voters she needs to win over.\n\nAfter the Saturday Night Live gig, Haley said on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that she had \"a blast\" on the program.\n\n\"Know it was past Donald\u2019s bedtime so looking forward to the stream of unhinged tweets in the a.m.,\" Haley said.\n\nTrump didn't wait until the end of the program to launch his counter-attack.\n\nAs Saturday's installment was airing, Trump used his Truth Social account to post a commercial about Haley's alleged flip-flops on various issues, from taxes to running for president.\n\nHe added a tagline: \"Tricky Nikki.\"\n\nThe SNL effect\n\nPoliticians have often used \"Saturday Night Live\" to knock their rivals \u2013 and to try to show voters that they can take a joke. Trump himself hosted the show in 2015.\n\nBut the former United Nations ambassador's jabs came after she had spent much of her campaign soft-pedaling her criticisms of Trump, as did many of GOP challengers who have since left the race, including Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nScott and DeSantis both promptly endorsed Trump after they jumped out of the primary.\n\n'Are you doing OK, Donald?'\n\nHaley stepped up her criticism of Trump after losses in Iowa and New Hampshire and heading into the South Carolina primary.\n\nTrump enjoys huge leads in Palmetto State polls, though Haley's recent hits have gotten under his skin. He has attacked her Indian American heritage, mangled her name and confused her in a fiery speech with former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nHaley in turn sought to hit Trump's weak spots during her surprise appearance on \"Saturday Night Live.\" The show's opening skit was a parody of a CNN town hall featuring the Trump character played by \"SNL\" regular James Austin Johnson.\n\nThe program cast Haley as a \"concerned\" town hall attendee and offered her a chance to make her case against Trump.\n\nHer opening lines: \u201cWhy won\u2019t you debate Nikki Haley?\u201d\n\nWhen the fictional Trump responded by again mixing up Haley and Pelosi, his GOP rival responded: \"Are you doing OK, Donald? ... You might need a mental competency test.\u201d\n\nThe Trump character then made fun of Haley's name. At one point, he referred to her as \"Nikki Haley Joel Osmet,\" a reference to the actor who stared in the 1999 horror film \"The Sixth Sense\" and uttered the famous line, \"I see dead people.\"\n\n\u201cYeah,\" Haley said, \"that\u2019s what voters will say if they see you and Joe (Biden) on the ballot.\u201d\n\n'I probably should have said that the first time'\n\nDespite the back and forth between a fictional Trump and Haley, she wasn't spared from criticism during the show.\n\nAt the end of the sketch, actress and host Ayo Edebiri, posing as a voter, asked Haley: \u201cWhat would you say was the main cause of the Civil War? And do you think it starts with an S and ends with a lavery?\u201d\n\nHaley responded: \u201cYep, I probably should have said that the first time.\u201d\n\nIn December, Haley drew intense criticism when she was asked during a town hall event about the cause of America's Civil War. She didn't mention slavery, and her fellow Republican candidates and President Joe Biden immediately called her out for the failure on the campaign trail.\n\nHaley later walked back her comments.\n\nTaking the gloves off?\n\nAt the start of the 2024 campaign, Haley, as well as DeSantis, often avoided harsh criticisms of Trump. She would calibrate her comments by praising the former president's policies but also saying the country needed to move on from the \"chaos\" he causes.\n\nHaley shifted to much more pointed \u2212 and personal \u2212 attacks after her third-place finish in the Iowa Caucuses and second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary.\n\nNow, Haley is trying to attract Republican and independent voters wary of Trump. But by sharpening her attacks on the former president, Haley is likely to further anger Trump's supporters, who are the base of the Republican party and could be for years to come.\n\nTeam Trump has suggested that Haley's new approach will put her on the path to political ruin.\n\n\"Haley just torpedoed her political future,\" Trump campaign aide Jason Miller wrote on X after Haley expressed confidence in the jury that awarded columnist E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in defamation damages from the former president.\n\n\"There is no point of return. Haley is politically finished for \u201824, \u201828, forever,\" Miller said.\n\nBut Gibbs Knotts, a political science professor at the College of Charleston, said Haley's \"SNL\" performance shouldn't hurt her ahead of South Carolina's primary, where the former governor is hoping to show that her campaign has picked up momentum.\n\n\"Generally, it's good when politicians can show some humor,\" Knotts said. However, he noted that her overall approach to Trump is challenging. Trump's MAGA movement is likely to remain a factor if Haley runs for president again in the future.\n\n\"It's a really tough situation she's in,\" Knotts said. \"It's a dilemma for so many Republicans today.\"\n\nHaley's aggression is no surprise, allies and analysts told USA TODAY. You have to be a fighter to rise from a little-known state legislator to governor \u2013 all as a woman of color \u2013 as Haley did in 2010.\n\nKnotts noted that the current fight for the Republican nomination is \"a two-person race and it\u2019s common in American politics to criticize the main opponent. I think she will stay aggressive as long as both are in the race.\"\n\nKaton Dawson, a Haley supporter and former state Republican chairman in South Carolina, said Haley's political rise was \"rather an amazing sight to see.\" Dawson noted that Trump began attacking her in earnest the night of the New Hampshire primary, even insulting the dress she wore to a watch party.\n\n\"Look, she's just fighting back,\" Dawson said."}

(Video: John Martin)\n\nSYDNEY \u2014 Lisa Akkoumi was enjoying a leisurely summer lunch with friends in a Sydney park recently when her cafe table suddenly erupted in a flurry of black and white feathers. When she looked down, half of her meal was gone. And in its place was the grimy, six-inch beak of Australia\u2019s most infamous bird.\n\nBehold, the bin chicken: the bane of outdoor dining Down Under, toxic tormentor of children\u2019s playgrounds and all-around avian villain \u2014 at least in the eyes of many here.\n\n\u201cThey are a pest,\u201d said Akkoumi, after shooing away the culprit. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who loves them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, some Australians adore the bin chicken, whose real name \u2014 the white ibis \u2014 has been eclipsed by its dumpster-diving nom de plumage.\n\nFrom Brisbane to Melbourne \u2014 but especially in Sydney \u2014 bin chickens are now ubiquitous. Driven from their natural wetlands, their urban numbers have risen in recent years, leading to growing resentment of the bird.\n\nBut the creature also has a cult following. No trendy neighborhood is complete without a bin chicken mural. Bin chicken tattoos are now almost as easy to spot as the bird itself. Several children\u2019s books are devoted to the much-maligned species. And there\u2019s even an effort to make it the mascot for the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane.\n\nIts resilience, meanwhile, has made it an emblem for immigrants, an icon for the LGBTQ+ community and a favorite of ornithologists.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate the noise, the smell, the sight of the bin chicken,\u201d said John Martin, an ecologist and bird expert in Sydney. \u201cThey miss the picture that this is quite a unique species. They are living in our urban habitat with us. They\u2019ve adapted.\u201d\n\nMartin calls them the winged equivalent of an \u201cAussie battler,\u201d or everyday hero. \u201cThey just get on with things,\u201d he said.\n\nWhether they get on with things a little too well, however, is the question.\n\nSacred or just stinky?\n\nAustralians are spoiled for beautiful birds: Resplendent rainbow lorikeets are everywhere. So are sulfur-crested cockatoos. Drive through the Outback, and you might not see a human for days, but you\u2019ll be surrounded by brilliant green budgerigars and blushing pink galahs.\n\nThe white ibis, however, is not one of them.\n\nIn ancient Egypt, ibises were worshiped as embodiments of the god of wisdom and magic. Their mummies have been found in Egyptian tombs. Herodotus wrote that if someone killed one, \u201cthere is no alternative but to put the offender to death.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s white ibis is a close relative of the Egyptian variety. Its scientific name, Threskiornis molucca, comes from the Greek words threskos (sacred) and ornis (bird).\n\nBut that\u2019s about as hallowed as the bin chicken gets. With its gangly limbs, wrinkly black head and beady eyes, this bird isn\u2019t your typical Audubon calendar model. Any color on its feathers probably comes from the trash.\n\nIts nicknames are no more glamorous: dump chook, tip turkey, garbage goose. Some call it the Bankstown flamingo after the Sydney suburb where the birds first invaded a quarter-century ago, when drought \u2014 and poor environmental planning \u2014 pushed them out of their native wetlands in western New South Wales.\n\nSurprisingly, the birds flourished. Instead of rural wetlands, they began inhabiting inner-city reservoirs, irrigation canals and even nonnative palm trees. Instead of snakes, fish and frogs, they began using their long legs and beaks to raid landfills, rubbish cans and picnics for french fries and other foods they normally would never consume.\n\nThe bin chicken was born \u2014 and born and born.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike in wetlands, where white ibises flock after large rainfalls to breed for a few months, Sydney\u2019s carb-fueled bin chickens mate year-round, Martin said.\n\nBy 2003, about 1,000 of the birds had settled in Bankstown, destroying vegetation and annoying residents. The local council hired an exterminator to shoot them, but it made little difference. Two decades later, the suburb is still struggling to control its bin chickens, whose numbers fluctuate between 1,600 and 2,800 among multiple sites, officials say.\n\nIbis culls are now less common than oiling their eggs to prevent them from hatching. Like other native species, the birds are protected in New South Wales: Killing them requires a permit, though that hasn\u2019t prevented occasional attempts to cook one.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nUnlike Brisbane, Sydney hasn\u2019t adopted a citywide plan for managing its bin chicken populations, Martin said. As a result, a suburb will sometimes dislodge a colony only to push them next door.\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s hard to blame the unfortunate souls who suddenly find themselves battling a bin chicken brood.\n\nDuring the covid-19 pandemic, Tamara and Brett Yandell fled their central Sydney home to stay with relatives down the coast. When they returned a few months later, they discovered that dozens of bin chickens had taken roost in the gum trees next door. The roof and side of their house were coated in smelly white droppings.\n\n\u201cTheir poos are huge,\u201d Tamara said. \u201cYou can actually hear them hitting the ground.\u201d\n\nWhen the council couldn\u2019t do anything, the Yandells took matters into their own hands. First, Brett tried booting a football into the branches to scatter the birds, but in this game of bin chicken, the birds barely flinched. He now heads outside every other evening with a black contraption the size of a sawed-off shotgun. But instead of buckshot, it shoots red and green laser beams that annoy the birds.\n\n\u201cPeople in the neighborhood think we\u2019re a bit weird,\u201d Tamara said with a laugh.\n\n(Video: John Martin)\n\nIn fact, bin chicken horror stories are common here. At one Sydney preschool, so many roosted on the roof that it looked like a scene from Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cThe Birds.\u201d The ibises splattered the playground so thoroughly that the school worried children would catch salmonella.\n\nThere is no denying it, Martin said. For all their virtues, white ibises smell, especially when mating. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re dingy dumpster divers or snowy white wetland specimens.\n\n\u201cThey quite literally stink,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Sexy bin chickens\u2019\n\nA few years ago, when an LGBTQ+ sports league in Sydney needed a Mardi Gras costume, someone had an idea. \u201cBin chickens,\u201d recalled Jamarr Mills. \u201cBut sexy bin chickens.\u201d\n\nLike many in the Emerald City Kickball league, Mills is an American transplant. The bin chicken seemed like an appropriate icon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a creature that feels a bit out of place,\u201d said the Maryland native, who is Emerald City\u2019s chief brand officer. \u201cPeople look at it and think, \u2018What is this weird thing doing here?\u2019 But they eventually come to appreciate what it adds to the environment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March of 2021, Mills and other shirtless kickballers donned bin chicken headdresses and sequined wings to strut around the Sydney Cricket Ground. This year, they plan to elaborate on the outfits for Mardi Gras.\n\n\u201cThere is something really fun, beautiful and kind of quirky about this bird that is able to find delight in things that other people throw away,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bin chicken may be widely despised, with songs and a fake documentary mocking it. But that underbird status also adds to its allure.\n\n(Video: John Martin)\n\nSydney and Melbourne have murals of the dumpster diver. Bin chicken merch flies off the shelf.

According to legend, the siblings founded Kyiv on the shores of the Dnieper in the 6th century. In the sculpture, they are shown arriving by boat from the north on their way to Tsargrad, present-day Istanbul.\n\nUkraine\u2019s cultural history is intertwined with the river.\n\nIn his 1845 poem \u201cMy Testament,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s most cherished poet, Taras Shevchenko, wrote of not being able to rest until Ukraine was free and the river\u2019s water \u201cbears \u2026 the blood of foes.\u201d That same struggle against Russian oppression continues today.\n\nA man swims on the banks of the Dnieper River during a heavy snow in Kyiv.\n\nPeople bundle up and enjoy the view. Swimmers dry themselves after spending time in the river.\n\nPushing large slabs of floating ice out of their way, wild swimmers start their day by plunging naked into the Dnieper\u2019s brutally cold water on an island in Kyiv\u2019s hydropark.\n\n\u201cThe river is our life, it gives us energy \u2014 we can\u2019t live without water,\u201d says Valentina Shevchenko, 65, a retired economist who leads a weekly exercise class by the river. Shevchenko insists she has swum \u201cevery day for 17 years\u201d \u2014 even in the first days of war.\n\n\u201cI feel amazing,\u201d says Olena Korotchuk, 46, walking barefoot over ice and wrapping herself in a thin shawl.

The two fishermen evacuated about 1,500 civilians in their boats.\n\nWith Europe to the west and Russia to the east, Ukraine\u2019s identity and geography are united and divided by the Dnieper. Ukrainians understand their demography by referencing the river\u2019s left and right banks; right being to the west and left to the east looking downstream.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine from Belarus in February 2022, fishermen Andriy Bushuev, 53, and Olexandr Dvorianets, 40, from the riverside village of Strakholissya were sandwiched between occupying forces and a swollen section of the river called the Kyiv Sea.\n\nWith other locals, the men evacuated about 1,500 civilians using two small fishing boats, crossing the river\u2019s 10-mile breadth with up to 16 people per boat, three times per day.\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nOn return journeys, their boats were first full of food and medicine \u2014 then later, with explosives and Ukrainian soldiers, who secretly massed on the Dnieper\u2019s western shores.\n\nIn Strakholissya, by the Dnieper\u2019s edge, stand gold-painted busts of middle-aged men and a statue of a woman holding a baby and pushing back a dragon. The monument is dedicated to water management workers who risked their lives to stop the radioactive contamination of the river after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\nFurther south, some lowlands remain underwater near the village of Demydiv, which was deliberately flooded to halt the Russian advance in spring 2022.\n\nLand remains flooded on the outskirts of Demydiv village.\n\nA monument in Strakholissya celebrates the water management workers who put their lives at risk to protect the Dnieper River from nuclear contamination after the Chernobyl disaster.

A woman sells fresh river fish to a customer in a market in central Cherkasy.\n\nBefore Russia\u2019s invasion, the Dnieper was a grain superhighway. Nibulon, one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest grain companies, used its fleet of 86 barges and tugboats to lug up to 3.7 million tons of grain from storage facilities along the river to ports on the Black Sea. In wartime, shipping is banned, and the vast grain containers now stand next to the boatless river.\n\nNibulon\u2019s founder, Oleksiy Vadatursky, 74, and his wife were killed by a Russian missile strike in Mykolaiv in July 2022.\n\nDressed in long, green coats, workers at the Irkliiv Fish Nursery heave a net across the width of one of the site\u2019s 54 fish ponds. The water boils with flashes of fin and tail \u2014 and an occasional carp makes a lucky leap to temporary freedom.

From a nearby drainage canal, filthy water slides directly into the river.\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m worried about the pollution, but we don\u2019t have a sea. We want to spend time on the water,\u201d says Ludmyla Kulykova, 33, a bank worker whose 18-month-old toddler, David, is playing at the water\u2019s edge. Kulykova picks up her boy as a small black water snake slithers past.\n\nBefore the 2022 invasion, Ukraine\u2019s Accounting Chamber warned that the river was heading for an \u201cecological disaster\u201d when 161 pollutants were found. About 70 percent of the country\u2019s prewar population used the Dnieper and its tributaries as their main water source.\n\nLudmyla Kulykova and her son David play on the river's banks in the city of Dnipro.\n\nDucks swim through blue-green algae.

The decades-old drainage system was designed to release city rainwater into the river, but small businesses and private homeowners illegally dump waste into the storm collectors, says Victor Demianow, Dnipro\u2019s leading hydrologist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d Demianow says.\n\nSoldiers take photos in front of the Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant above the partially drained river in Zaporizhzhia.\n\nA boy cycles past a water pumping system in Zaporizhzhia that became inactive after the Kakhovka dam was blown up.

On hot days, the Dnieper\u2019s slow-moving reservoirs can turn bright green with vast blooms of blue-green algae, which produces toxins that deplete the water\u2019s oxygen, starving fish and other aquatic life.\n\nAs the last light fades from the sky, Evgeniy, 65, sits and jokes with his friends by a promenade near the city of Kamianske at a spot where they fished for years. \u201cEvery year there are fewer fish, and some types of fish have gone altogether,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the pollution.\u201d\n\nMap locating Kherson and the Dnieper River in Ukraine\n\nDnieper R.

Belous winces, leans forward on the sofa and points at his back. There is a large bloody hole between his shoulder blade and spine.\n\nUkraine liberated the riverside city of Kherson in November 2022. Since then, the Dnieper has been a front line, with the east bank still largely held by Russia.\n\nIn the city, danger levels increase as one approaches the Dnieper from the city center. Russian forces use drones and sniper sites to target military positions.

Because who cares? And do you know why? Because people have conducted an honest cost-to-benefit analysis of dusty social conventions (most of them from other centuries) and found them wanting.\n\nHoney, nobody is forcing you to attend dinner parties. By your own account, you are not likely even to be invited to one.\n\nBut you are missing out on the second-most pleasurable activity human beings can indulge in together. That would be convivial conversation: the exchange of ideas and experiences in an atmosphere of leisure, comfort and goodwill. Where nobody steps on your punchline by asking, \u201cAre you still working on that?\u201d\n\nMiss Manners supposes that you define \u201cdinner parties\u201d as extravaganzas that rich people put on in order to display their silverware \u2014 thus ignoring thousands of years of human history, when the peaceful, communal breaking of bread has been a defining ritual of civilization. Religions, too, extol the virtue of the humblest sharing what little they have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut you are right that the custom is becoming unfeasible for many reasons, not the least of which is the cost analysis you mention \u2014 the feeling that why, indeed, should people, rich or poor, share what they have? And if they want to, why should the beneficiaries be grateful, or even cooperative?\n\nAnother major factor is the decline, before that, of the nightly family dinner. That is where children had to learn such counterintuitive ideas as taking turns talking, listening to others with minds open to the possibility that others \u2014 even their own relatives \u2014 could be saying something worth hearing, and, if necessary, disagreeing without being disagreeable. It would be a useful skill in today\u2019s world. So it is sad that many now believe that getting along with others, and even seeking their points of view, is out of fashion.\n\nDear Miss Manners: I am a female physician in a rural town. This is a retirement community, and I have a number of older male patients. Sometimes a man will stand when I enter the exam room, and it is such a delightful sign of respect. I am not certain of what my response should be. Since I am grateful for such treatment, I say \u201cthank you\u201d and proceed with the visit. Is there a better response?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes: \u201cGood morning. Please sit down. How do you feel today?\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIt is not clear to Miss Manners whether you believe this gesture is meant as a courtesy from a gentleman to a lady, in which case it is out of place in a professional setting, or is intended to show respect to you as a doctor, which is only slightly excessive.\n\nNo matter. In any case, it is obviously well meant. Acknowledging it with more than a polite smile would be making too much of an issue of it. Even in social life, this does not require thanks, and in your office, doing so would seem to accept it as obeisance.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

When he started seeing Charlotte too often and without including me in the communication, I expressed my concern and asked for him to cease contact with her.\n\nBrett has told me that it\u2019s not a concern and that he will continue to see Charlotte, even though I disapprove. He says I\u2019m crazy for being upset and concerned. I\u2019m not sure where to go from here.\n\n\u2014 Peeved Partner\n\nPeeved: You believe that you and your partner have a binding agreement. I happen to believe that this is a contract with a high likelihood of being breached, because you have put yourself in the position of controlling a type of human behavior which is notoriously challenging to control \u2014 in part because it involves two people (\u201cBrett\u201d and \u201cCharlotte\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy point is that while Brett may have agreed to this \u201csex-only\u201d contract, if Charlotte wants to be with him longer-term, she has no incentive to comply. And now, like a plot twist from a low-rent Jane Austen novel, these two seem to have developed an actual relationship.\n\nDespite the somewhat unconventional nature of your contract, all of the humans involved are behaving in conventional ways: You are jealous and suspicious; he responds by gaslighting you.

I simply could not have made it through that awful period without their love and emotional and practical support.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nRecently I heard a rumor that Wendy had been caught shoplifting at a local shop. It didn\u2019t really seem possible, but my understanding is that she was not charged because she returned the items and because this was a first offense. I went out to a local brewpub with Wendy and her husband last week. While there, I ordered appetizers for the group that were delivered on a large decorative platter. After a while I excused myself and went to the restroom.\n\nAs I was headed back to the table, I witnessed Wendy putting the (empty) ceramic platter into her large bag, which her husband was holding open for her. I was stunned, but I didn\u2019t say anything. I thanked them for taking me out and haven\u2019t talked to them since. We\u2019ve had some contact on Facebook, but yesterday she blocked me (possibly because I have dodged a couple of phone calls?).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am so sad now.

Former Arizona Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury agreed to a three-year contract to be the offensive coordinator and Dallas Cowboys secondary coach and defensive passing game coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. agreed to be the defensive coordinator, multiple people with knowledge of the hires said Sunday night.\n\nKingsbury, who was a senior offensive assistant at Southern California last season, appeared in line for the Las Vegas Raiders\u2019 offensive coordinator job but reportedly pulled his name from consideration and quickly emerged as a top candidate for Washington. He takes over amid a top-to-bottom rebuild of the team that started last year with Josh Harris\u2019s $6.05 billion purchase of the franchise and continued with the hiring of General Manager Adam Peters in January.\n\nWashington turned to Quinn largely because of his leadership, experience and success on the defensive side, but Kingsbury could have an even greater impact on the team\u2019s trajectory. Washington is coming off a 4-13 season and has not posted a winning record since 2016. It has churned through 14 starting quarterbacks over the past decade and sorely needs an infusion of creativity and player development on offense. Kingsbury has a record of both.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA former Texas Tech quarterback drafted by the New England Patriots in the sixth round in 2003, Kingsbury spent the better part of four seasons in the NFL, primarily as a practice squad player. He played in the Canadian Football League briefly, then turned to coaching, starting as a quality control coach at the University of Houston in 2008.\n\nKingsbury, 44, was later elevated to co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, then jumped to Texas A&M, where he was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach and worked with 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel. In 2013, Kingsbury was hired as his alma mater\u2019s coach and helped develop first-round quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Baker Mayfield with the Red Raiders.\n\nAfter Kingsbury was fired following the 2018 season, the Cardinals grabbed him to be their coach in 2019, the same year they selected quarterback Kyler Murray with the draft\u2019s first pick. The Cardinals went 28-37-1 in four seasons under Kingsbury before firing him in January 2023. He joined USC three months later and worked with 2022 Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Caleb Williams, whom the Commanders will eye closely as the draft nears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKingsbury has modified his offense over the years to be a pro-style Air Raid. His scheme gives the appearance of a more modern-day spread offense, but it doesn\u2019t discount the running game. In 2020 and 2021, the Cardinals ranked sixth and seventh in rushing attempts, an aspect that was missing in Washington\u2019s offense last season. But how he tailors his scheme to Washington\u2019s personnel remains to be seen, in part because Washington\u2019s personnel figures to be in flux, too.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe Commanders have five picks in the first three rounds of the draft. They also are projected to have the most salary cap space in the NFL, giving them plenty of room to add talent.\n\nKingsbury will be Washington\u2019s third play caller and coordinator in as many years, following Scott Turner, who ran an Air Coryell system from 2020 to 2022, and Eric Bieniemy, who ran a West Coast offense in 2023. Bieniemy has another year on his contract and seems likely to be let go after Kingsbury\u2019s arrival.\n\nWhitt, 45, follows Quinn for the second time to take over a Commanders defense that struggled in nearly every facet last season. A former walk-on wide receiver at Auburn, Whitt began coaching in 2000 and joined the pro ranks as assistant defensive backs coach for the Atlanta Falcons in 2007. After 11 seasons as a defensive assistant for the Green Bay Packers, with whom he won Super Bowl XLV, and a year with the Cleveland Browns, Whitt returned to Atlanta as the secondary coach and passing game coordinator under Quinn. He kept that title when he joined Quinn with Dallas in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhitt and Quinn helped transform a Cowboys defense that ranked 28th in points allowed and 23rd in yards allowed in 2020 into a group that led the league in interceptions and finished seventh in points allowed in 2021. Last season, the Cowboys ranked fifth in total yards, passing yards and points allowed. The Commanders ranked last in all three categories.\n\nAlthough Quinn pulled the strings for the Cowboys\u2019 defense last year, it\u2019s unclear whether he plans to call the coverages as Washington\u2019s coach; he did so intermittently for Atlanta. More pressing, it seems, was ensuring his coordinator was familiar with his system and that he quickly assembled his staff to begin a full evaluation of the roster and the team\u2019s plans to revamp it.\n\nPeters, who will orchestrate the Commanders\u2019 rebuild, said at his introductory news conference that he views this situation similar to that of the 2017 San Francisco 49ers, who also had the second draft pick (they traded down), a new coach (Kyle Shanahan) and a new GM (John Lynch).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very process-driven and diligent in who we select in free agency,\u201d Peters said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to build through the draft here. ... It\u2019s having an aligned vision, having collaboration, having inclusion with everybody, everybody pulling in the same direction.\u201d"}

The $118 billion national security legislation also includes billions of dollars in funding for Ukraine, Israel, the Indo-Pacific and humanitarian aid, but it has a politically perilous path ahead. Even before seeing its contents, lawmakers on both the right \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, the left \u2014 flanks in Congress have slammed the measure and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) called it \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in the chamber. Former president Donald Trump, who has made the border a core campaign issue, opposes the deal.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced that he would hold the first procedural vote on the legislation on Wednesday, leaving the bill\u2019s boosters little time to sell its provisions. \u201cSenators must shut out the noise from those who want this agreement to fail for their own political agendas,\u201d he said in a statement Sunday evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe legislation \u2014 a top priority for President Biden \u2014 would, if passed, mark the first significant action taken by Congress on immigration in decades. It attempts to close loopholes in the asylum process, limit the use of parole for migrants at the border and give the president new authority to effectively shut down the border to migrants when attempted crossings are high. \u201cGet it to my desk so I can sign it into law immediately,\u201d Biden said in a statement.\n\nAn administration official also said Sunday the bill would help Israel \u201creplenish its air defenses\u201d as it continues its offensive against Hamas in Gaza, as well as provide funds for U.S. Central Command as it defends positions in Iraq and Syria and continues to clash with Yemen\u2019s Houthis in the Red Sea.\n\nSen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), the lead Republican negotiator, called the bill\u2019s changes to asylum \u201cdramatic,\u201d and predicted it would discourage migrants from attempting to come to the United States if passed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople come in mass numbers because they\u2019re getting released,\u201d into the country, Lankford said in an interview Sunday. \u201cIf the word gets out immediately that it\u2019s not true anymore, people will come in a more orderly fashion.\u201d\n\nThe proposal would make it harder for migrants to apply for and qualify for asylum. The bill also encourages quicker resolutions to asylum cases at the border and creates a new removal authority to speedily remove migrants who don\u2019t qualify for asylum.\n\nThe bill includes a trigger mechanism that would allow the border to be effectively shut down to migrants if crossings have been particularly high for several days in a row. (Around 1,400 migrants would still be able to qualify for asylum at ports of entry.)\n\nThat \u201cborder emergency\u201d provision, which expires in three years, would automatically kick in when crossings reached 5,000 per day for several days, but a president could choose to use the tool at a lower number, 4,000 per day. The legislation also scales back the Biden administration\u2019s use of parole at land ports of entry and provides for the hiring of thousands of new Border Patrol and asylum officers, as well as increasing detention capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposal also includes some Democratic priorities, including adding thousands more family-based and employment-based visas, allowing work authorization for spouses of U.S. citizens awaiting immigrant visas and guaranteeing access to counsel for child migrants in removal proceedings. The legislation also allows for work visas for those who do qualify for asylum.\n\nRepublicans initially demanded a border policy change to pass $60 billion in Ukraine aid requested by the White House last year, and the final deal contains many tough border provisions that Republicans have long hoped to implement.\n\nBut the politics of the deal abruptly changed when Trump and his allies began attacking the idea of passing any border legislation \u2014 fearful that addressing the border crisis might remove a potent campaign issue for him in an election year. Many Senate Republicans have signaled that they will not support the package, and some have mischaracterized its contents as negotiators took months to finalize the bill text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that we were able to change not just policy over the course of negotiations but the politics of the Democratic base that (they) accepted border security,\u201d said one frustrated Republican senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about the likely Republican presidential nominee. \u201cAnd here we are, Trump once again snatches defeat from the jaws of victory.\u201d\n\nJohnson said this weekend he planned a vote in the House on billions in aid to Israel without money for Ukraine or the border, further complicating the Senate deal\u2019s prospects. \u201cThe House is willing to lead and the reason we have to take care of this Israel situation right now is because the situation has escalated,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d before the release of the text.\n\nIn a letter to his Democratic colleagues, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) called Johnson\u2019s new Israel-only bill \u201ca cynical attempt to undermine the Senate\u2019s bipartisan effort.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been supportive of the deal, however, as he publicly fights for continued aid to Ukraine as it struggles to fend off a Russian invasion. Schumer has also firmly backed negotiations led by Lankford, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) and the White House, arguing that it is the Senate\u2019s responsibility to ensure Russian President Vladimir Putin does not continue his assault on a European nation.\n\nThe United States has sent $44 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the 2022 invasion, but the Biden administration warned late last year that it had reached the end of its ability to continue to arm Ukraine absent congressional help. Republican lawmakers began to object to sending more money to the nation last year as polls showed their voters souring on the idea.\n\n\u201cThe challenges we face will not resolve themselves, nor will our adversaries wait for America to muster the resolve to meet them,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \u201cThe Senate must carefully consider the opportunity in front of us and prepare to act.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorder officials in December processed the most migrants ever recorded in one month \u2014 around 300,000 \u2014 and Biden has said he wants congressional help to ease the crisis. A majority of voters disapprove of his handling of the border, polls show, making the issue a potential liability for him as he seeks reelection in 2024.\n\nThe overall aid package includes $14 billion in assistance for Israel, $60 billion for Ukraine and $4.83 billion to Indo-Pacific nations. It also has $9.2 billion in humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank, Ukraine and other nations, as well as $20 billion in U.S. border funds. (The bill explicitly denies federal funding to UNRWA, the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians, following allegations that 12 of its 13,000 employees were involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.) Its $118 billion overall price tag is now higher than the White House\u2019s initial request of $106 billion.\n\nThe talks have been unusual, given that past efforts at bipartisan immigration reform included discussions of providing pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already living in the country demanded by Democrats, in addition to tightening border restrictions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome immigrant rights groups expressed dismay at the border deal on Sunday. Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, said the bill would lead to \u201cmore families separated, more children detained, and more people sent back to face persecution, torture, and even death.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of enacting draconian policies that create more chaos, we urge the White House and Senate Democrats to change course, reject this framework, and recommit to building an orderly, humane, and functioning immigration system,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) said on Sunday he was opposed to the bill, comparing it to \u201cfailed Trump-era immigration policies.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who support this deal are urging their colleagues to back it, arguing there is no way they would get border restrictions even if Trump is elected president, given that Democrats are unlikely to cooperate with him without demanding legalization for undocumented immigrants as part of the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a unique moment,\u201d Sinema said last month. \u201cAnd I think we should take it.\u201d\n\nThe politics of the issue rapidly changed after Trump signaled his displeasure with a deal and as he appears primed to lock up the Republican presidential nomination. A faction of Lankford\u2019s home-state Republican Party even voted to censure him for his role in the negotiations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an optimistic person, period,\u201d Lankford said Thursday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m still standing here after being hit in the face repetitively for a while.\u201d\n\nJohnson and other Republicans opposed to the deal have incorrectly argued, even before the text was released, that the bill would let more migrants into the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll no longer have people just entering the country, and maybe going to court in the next seven or ten years,\u201d Sinema said Sunday on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS. \u201cInstead, we\u2019ll make swift justice. Folks who do qualify for asylum will be on a rapid path, six months or less, to start a new life in America. And those who do not qualify will quickly be returned to their home countries.\u201d\n\nSenate Republicans have said they want at least a few days to read the legislation before voting behind closed doors to see how much support the deal has in the conference. And some senators, including Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), have said it\u2019s unrealistic to begin voting on the legislation this week. If fewer than 25 Republicans support it, its fate is dim.\n\n\u201cI, for one, think it is a mistake to send this bill to the House without a majority of the Republican conference,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a booster of the negotiations who has argued he believes the deal would help solve the border crisis.\n\nIf the legislation does pass the Senate, it faces just a tough road in the House, where many Republicans have already come out against the legislation. The opposition puts pressure on Johnson, who is trying to corral a fragile and small GOP majority while simultaneously fending off threats to his job.\n\nHe told his colleagues in a letter over the weekend that failure to include him in Senate negotiations \u201chas eliminated the ability for swift consideration\u201d of the bill. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the House majority leader, declared in a social media post on Sunday that the deal would not receive a vote in the House.\n\nLankford responded to Johnson\u2019s criticism on Sunday. \u201cIf the House wants to be able to take it up and amend it that is completely within the right of the House to be able to do that,\u201d he said."}

The threat? Ants that are smaller than a grain of rice. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The invasive insects that arrived in Kenya in the early 2000s, probably due to global shipping and international tourism, have caused an \u201cecological chain reaction,\u201d according to researchers. Big-headed ants kill native acacia ants, which protect trees from elephants and other herbivores in Kenya \u2014 one of a few African nations with a sizable lion population \u2014 by swarming into the animals\u2019 nostrils and biting when they try to eat the trees\u2019 leaves, branches and bark.\n\nAs acacia ants have dwindled, elephants have been able to knock down and eat more whistling thorn trees. With fewer trees, lions have lost the cover they rely on to stealthily attack zebras, their primary prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study, which was published Jan. 25 in the journal Science, found that lions are less likely to kill zebras in uncovered areas. They killed 25 percent fewer zebras between 2003 and 2020, the study said.\n\n\u201cWhen you have invasive species, they can affect other species that wouldn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with the species invasion in kind of weird, unpredictable ways \u2014 ways that are hidden, but very serious,\u201d study co-author Jacob Goheen, a University of Wyoming zoology professor, told The Washington Post.\n\nThe findings were a result of years of research on animals and insects in a nature conservancy in Kenya. A study from March 2015 found that whistling thorn trees, which are native to East Africa and can grow about 18 feet tall, were suffering after big-headed ants had invaded the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya\u2019s Laikipia County.\n\nAcacia ants live in whistling thorn trees, which provide them nectar. In return, the ants protect the trees from predators \u2014 a symbiotic relationship. But after big-headed ants kill acacia ants and eat their eggs, larvae and pupae, elephants are no longer warded off and they can break down more trees in those areas. Roughly 75 percent of the conservancy\u2019s trees have vanished, Goheen said.\n\nAnother study published in May 2019 found that lions killed more zebras in areas of the Ol Pejeta Conservancy that had more tree cover. Lions typically hunt zebras by hiding behind trees and chasing them when they approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearchers from both studies worked together to try to connect their findings to determine whether the invasive ants were affecting lions\u2019 behavior.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIn May 2018, researchers attached GPS collars to six lions in the Ol Pejeta Conservancy. Using computers, researchers then tracked the lions\u2019 locations in the roughly 140-square-mile protected savannah.\n\nLions usually moved fast, and sometimes in groups, when they were chasing prey. So when researchers saw a cluster of red tracking points on their computers \u2014 indicating that multiple lions were moving quickly around the same area \u2014 they predicted that lions had hunted prey there. Within a few days, researchers drove to the area to record which animal the lions had killed and how much tree cover was nearby. They drove with an armed security guard in case an animal attacked them, researcher Douglas Kamaru said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearchers continued that routine for about two years, determining that the six lions they were tracking had killed about 140 animals. Roughly half of those kills were zebras, which lions were more than two times more likely to kill in areas with tree protection than in uncovered areas, the study said.\n\nDespite lions eating fewer zebras, researchers don\u2019t expect the vulnerable species\u2019 population to dwindle in the conservatory. That\u2019s because lions found a new food source: African buffalo.\n\nWhile zebras usually run away when they spot lions, buffalo often fight back, making cover less important before the hunt. Still, buffalo aren\u2019t lions\u2019 first choice for food, Goheen said. Killing a zebra takes one or two lions; killing a buffalo takes between five and 10, Goheen said.\n\nAs big-headed ants continue to expand in the area, researchers said other problems could emerge. For example, endangered black rhinos eat whistling thorn trees but could lose their food source, study co-author Corinna Riginos said."}

For more Style stories, click here End of carousel\n\nWeathers, who died Thursday at 76, was briefly an Oakland Raider before becoming a fan-favorite actor, beloved as a foil to Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Adam Sandler and, decades later, Pedro Pascal. But \u201cAction Jackson,\u201d a deeply weird but highly watchable attempt to launch Weathers as an action star in his own right, is a persuasive argument that the onetime Apollo Creed\u2019s big-screen legacy \u2014 always the best man, never the groom \u2014 should have been greater. It is the only movie that could be described as a Carl Weathers vehicle, or at the least the only one that got a proper late-\u201980s promotional rollout, with Weathers hosting \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and joshing with Jay Leno on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d And yet he still didn\u2019t get his due: The title \u201cAction Jackson\u201d flashes on screen in bold red all-caps before Weathers\u2019s name does.\n\nThe hypermasculine, R-rated action genre was a path to stardom in this era, but it could also be a trap. The same year \u201cAction Jackson\u201d gave Weathers his shot, Schwarzenegger pivoted to comedy in \u201cTwins\u201d and was rewarded with his biggest hit to date. Stallone tried to follow, but a comedian the Italian Stallion was not. We know now that Weathers could do both, but it was obvious even then: You need only dial up his SNL episode, featuring musical guest Robbie Robertson but also Weathers\u2019s dead-to-rights Al Sharpton impression, to see that he was a game goofball in the body of \u2026 well, an Adonis, the name that 2015\u2019s \u201cCreed\u201d would tell us that Apollo gave to his out-of-wedlock son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeathers might have had a future like Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, earning an extremely comfortable living as a twinkly-eyed man-mountain headlining unmemorable but ostensibly family-friendly PG-13 flicks. Instead, it seemed just a little too plausible when he turned up in the cult sitcom \u201cArrested Development,\u201d playing a hilariously cheap version of himself whom David Cross\u2019s character hires as his acting coach. Weathers\u2019s \u201cacting advice\u201d consists entirely of desperate guidance on how to save money on food. When he tells Cross, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of meat left on that bone,\u201d he doesn\u2019t mean it metaphorically.\n\nBy 1988, Weathers was already recognizable for playing Apollo Creed, Rocky Balboa\u2019s opponent and then ally in \u201cRocky\u201d and three sequels. The character was initially based on Muhammad Ali, and was set to be played by real-life heavyweight boxer Ken Norton. But Norton dropped out and Weathers got the part, which he imbued with more and more of his own ebullient personality as the series went on.\n\nThe indelible, much-parodied training montage from 1982\u2019s \u201cRocky III,\u201d with Apollo and Rocky running sprints on the beach in short shorts before embracing triumphantly in the spray, proved that even the most totemic or reductive beats of the \u201cRocky\u201d movies were exponentially better when Weathers was a part of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApollo was killed in the ring by Ivan Drago, Dolph Lundgren\u2019s affectless, chemically enhanced Soviet superathlete, in 1985\u2019s \u201cRocky IV,\u201d the Rockiad\u2019s silliest entry and its highest-grossing at the time. Yet Weathers\u2019s final performance in the role is the finest of his career. The monologue in which he tells his pal that they\u2019re both warriors \u2014 \u201cand without some war to fight, then the warrior may as well be dead, Stallion!\u201d \u2014 leaves you with no doubt he would take a hopeless fight against a younger, stronger opponent just to silence the gnawing fear that he\u2019s nothing. Weathers admitted years later that he was unhappy about his character being killed off. Apollo\u2019s fear of having to find his second or third act was palpably Weathers\u2019s fear, too.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWeathers graduated from being Stallone\u2019s sidekick to Schwarzenegger\u2019s, second-billed behind the Austrian Oak in \u201cPredator\u201d as an Army buddy of Schwarzenegger\u2019s character who has become a two-faced pencil-pusher for the CIA. Memes weren\u2019t a thing when \u201cPredator\u201d was released in the summer of 1987, but the close-up of Schwarzenegger and Weathers\u2019s greased-up, tumescent arms as they\u2019re reunited was lodged in our cultural memory long enough to become one. Years later, when Weathers was introduced in \u201cArrested Development,\u201d we got a brief clip of his gruesome \u201cPredator\u201d death scene, where the titular beast blasts one of his mighty arms off before sending the rest of him to join Apollo Creed in the great beyond.\n\nSevered arms became a leitmotif of Weathers\u2019s Silver-produced oeuvre. In \u201cAction Jackson,\u201d Weathers\u2019s \u201cPredator\u201d co-star Bill Duke tells him, \u201cYou nearly tore that boy\u2019s arm off!\u201d \u201cHe had a spare,\u201d Weathers rejoins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAction Jackson\u201d was one of those indefatigable \u201980s supercop movies, and probably the only one where someone actually says the word \u201cindefatigable.\u201d Weathers\u2019s Jericho \u201cAction\u201d Jackson is a former track star turned Detroit police officer who has a law degree from Harvard, although he hasn\u2019t used it to challenge his department\u2019s policy that \u201cJackson is so vicious we don\u2019t even let him carry a gun,\u201d as one uniformed flatfoot mentions in the tropey part of the movie in which a minor character makes sure we know what a world-beating titan our hero is before he makes his entrance. (Of course, Jackson uses his J.D. and his fast feet later in the film, citing case law and outrunning a taxicab.)\n\nThe plot has something to do with an evil automaker/martial arts expert played by Craig T. Nelson, who is having union officials murdered in needlessly elaborate ways. The plot is also very much not the point. The purpose, rather, is to showcase Weathers\u2019s all-rounder versatility, marshaling the charm and athleticism for which he was known already and the comedic gifts for which he\u2019d be cherished later. Weathers\u2019s third act was as a primarily comedic actor, in the 1996 Adam Sandler vehicle \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d as the hard-times version of himself in \u201cArrested Development,\u201d and as an interplanetary bail bondsman-turned-magistrate in \u201cThe Mandalorian.\u201d\n\nBut the cheek was there in \u201cAction Jackson,\u201d which seems to be a sendup of its genre, at least some of the time. There\u2019s a scene in which Jackson, being held by four henchmen, pretends to be a delusional preacher before punching his way out. (It\u2019s the sort of shtick Eddie Murphy pulled in the enormously popular \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d films of this era.) Elsewhere, Jackson drives a car not just through the front of a mansion but up the stairs to its second floor, and then around several corners to reach a bedroom where Nelson\u2019s villain is holding Vanity \u2014 the model/actress/singer who was briefly a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Prince \u2014 hostage. It\u2019s an odd film! But it\u2019s no less amusing an oddity than the Silver-produced Patrick Swayze sleazefest \u201cRoad House\u201d from a year later \u2014 and no less a showcase for the many talents of its undervalued star.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with the A.V. Club, Weathers said he\u2019d pitched Silver on the idea of a blaxploitation-esque throwback movie on the \u201cPredator\u201d set in 1986. \u201cPredator\u201d has just nine actors with speaking roles, and three of them turned up in \u201cAction Jackson.\u201d The movie came, and just as quickly went. It did not meaningfully improve Weathers\u2019s Q score. \u201c\u2018Action Jackson\u2019 is a movie where some of the parts are good, but none of them fit and a lot of them stink,\u201d is how Roger Ebert opened his one-star review. (To put that in context, though, Ebert gave \u201cDie Hard,\u201d long upheld as the action genre\u2019s gold standard, a tepid two stars.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeathers is the least awkward part of \u201cAction Jackson,\u201d which shifts tonally from scene to scene. What we see, though, is a convincing case that he was at least as deserving of name-above-title status as \u201980s action flick anchors like Chuck Norris and Steven Seagal, who was presented to the world as an established star in his very first film, \u201cAbove the Law.\u201d By the way, a palpably overqualified Sharon Stone played thankless-to-exploitative wife roles in \u201cAction Jackson\u201d and \u201cAbove the Law,\u201d four years before \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d made her an A-lister.\n\nSo the ascent is possible. And Weathers deserved to make it."}

This will be Swift\u2019s 11th studio album, not counting her re-recordings. Her last original album was \u201cMidnights,\u201d released in October 2022.

With it, she broke the record for the most wins in that category (her other albums of the year: \u201cFearless,\u201d \u201c1989\u201d and \u201cFolklore\u201d).\n\nAs she walked the red carpet in custom Schiaparelli Couture, she paid homage to her album title, donning a Lorraine Schwartz choker with a small clock embedded. And yes, the time was set to the midnight \u2014 even if the viewer had to tilt their head to see the hands pointing to \u201c12.\u201d\n\nWhile a nod to the album \u2014 and reminiscent of the \u201ctick, tick, tick\u201d in \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d post \u2014 the watch seemed particularly apt, given the superstar\u2019s seemingly packed schedule over the next week. Swift is set to head back out on her Eras Tour this week, performing for four nights in Tokyo. She still will be able to make it back to the U.S. later in the week to catch her boyfriend Travis Kelce playing in the Super Bowl.\n\n___\n\nSen reported from New York."}

Rebecca Lovell and Megan Lovell of Larkin Poe went for matching suits in circus stripes.\n\nThere was some memorable man jewelry as well, around the neck of Rufus Wainwright and a lapel of reggae artist Collie Buddz. Wainwright wore a party of gold necklaces. Buddz went for a grouping of jeweled brooches. Josh Groban opted for a single brooch.

The land of Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi and Frank Sinatra will be the focal point of the globe on that Sunday, when either Lionel Messi\u2019s Argentina will try to win its second straight title or a successor will emerge.\n\n\u201cIt will be a celebration of our diversity and our values,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe bigger picture is what leads up to it and what we leave behind for the decades to come.\u201d\n\nFIFA made the announcement Sunday at a Miami television studio, allocating the opener of the 39-day tournament to Mexico City\u2019s Estadio Azteca on June 11 and the finale to the home of the NFL\u2019s New York Jets and Giants.\n\nDallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had lobbied for the final to be at his AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.\n\n\u201cThe competition was dealing with the perception of the coastal, of a New York, or a Los Angeles,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this were totally being played to just America and the United States, that wouldn\u2019t have been such a formidable thing to overcome. But internationally, that\u2019s formidable to overcome.\u201d\n\nAll games from the quarterfinals on are being played in the United States. Semifinals are on July 14 at AT&T and the following day at Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\n\nQuarterfinals are at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on July 9, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the following day, and at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, and Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 11. The third-place game will be at Hard Rock on July 18.\n\nThe U.S. team will train in suburban Atlanta ahead of the tournament and open at SoFi on June 12. The Americans play seven days later at Seattle\u2019s Lumen Field and finish the group stage at SoFi on June 25.\n\nSince reaching the semifinals of the first World Cup in 1930, the U.S. has advanced to the quarterfinals just once, in 2002.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about making our nation proud,\u201d American coach Gregg Berhalter said. \u201cOne way to really grow the game and to change soccer in America forever is to perform well and do something that no U.S. team has ever done before.\u201d\n\nSeventy-eight of 104 matches will be played in the U.S., with 13 games each in Mexico and Canada, and there as many as six matches a day.\n\nAT&T will host a tournament-high nine matches. There will be eight each at MetLife, SoFi and Mercedes Benz; seven apiece at Hard Rock, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, and NRG Stadium in Houston; and six apiece at Lumen, Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, and Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nFIFA officials did not publicly explain their site-decision process.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s final match will be a round-of-16 meeting on July 4, the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Philadelphia\u2019s Citizens Bank Park hosts baseball\u2019s All-Star Game, likely on July 14.\n\nSanta Clara is the only U.S. site that will not host a game after the new round of 32. AT&T will host two round-of-32 matches.\n\nFIFA expanded the World Cup from 32 to 48 nations, increased matches from 64 and announced the 16 sites in 2022.\n\nMurphy learned of the decision while at a watch party in a MetLife Stadium suite. He was not discouraged by a British tabloid report on Jan. 17 that said the final would be at AT&T.\n\n\u201cWe did everything we could to put our head downs, focus on the job at hand, kind of push out the noise, and that turned out to be a winning formula,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nMexico will play its second match at Guadalajara\u2019s Estadio Akron on June 18 and return to Azteca on June 24. Mexico City will host five matches, with four each at Monterrey\u2019s Estadio BBVA and Guadalajara.\n\nCanada will play its opening first-round match in Toronto on June 12, then at B.C. Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, on June 18 and 24. Each Canada venue will host 13 games.\n\nA nation will need to play eight matches to win the title, up from seven since 1982.\n\nAll 11 of the U.S. stadiums are home to NFL teams. Hard Rock will host this year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica final on July 14, while MetLife was the site of the 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica final.\n\nBoth the 1970 and 1986 World Cup finals were at Azteca.\n\nWhen the U.S. hosted the 24-nation, 52-game tournament in 1994, the final was at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, the opener at Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field and the semifinals at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford and the Rose Bowl.\n\nWith the additional teams, the length of the tournament will grow from 29 days in the shortened 2022 schedule in Qatar and 32 days for the 2018 tournament in Russia.\n\nOnly one match will involve a team that has not had at least three off days. FIFA divided the group stage into East, Central and West regions and intended to make travel shorter for group winners.\n\nThe stadiums in Arlington, Atlanta and Houston have retractable roofs that are expected to be closed because of summer heat, and Inglewood and Vancouver have fixed roofs.\n\nArtificial turf will be replaced by grass in Arlington, Atlanta, East Rutherford, Foxborough, Houston, Inglewood, Seattle and Vancouver.\n\nSeveral of the venues are expected to widen their surfaces to accommodate a 75-by-115 yard (68-by-105 meter) playing field, including AT&T, MetLife and SoFi.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Schuyler Dixon in Arlington, Texas, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"}

The film, directed by Matthew Vaughn, managed to lead the weekend box office, but still found little interest from moviegoers.\n\nAlthough Apple has been in the original film business since 2019 and won the Oscar for best picture with 2021\u2019s \u201cCODA,\u201d the company has only recently produced its own lineup of big-budget releases. The first two \u2014 Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d and Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d \u2014 could be called successful.\n\n\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d though not profitable with $156 million in global sales, was one of the most celebrated films of 2023 and is nominated for 10 Academy Awards. \u201cNapoleon,\u201d released in November, has raked in $219 million worldwide \u2014 also not enough to turn a profit. But both films raised Apple\u2019s reputation as a home to top directors and prestige filmmaking.\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said for \u201cArgylle,\u201d a twisty thriller starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell and Henry Cavill. The movie was badly dinged by critics, who gave it a Rotten Tomatoes score of 35% \u201cfresh.\u201d Ticket buyers also gave it a thumbs down, with a C+ CinemaScore.\n\nApple has paired with traditional studios for each of those releases. Universal Pictures handled the rollout of \u201cArgylle,\u201d which opened in 3,605 North American venues and took in an additional $17.3 million in 78 international markets. Paramount handled \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d while Sony steered \u201cNapoleon.\u201d\n\n\u201cArgylle,\u201d with \u201cKingsman\u201d director Vaughn at the helm, was made with aspirations of starting a new franchise. But one of its biggest talking points ahead of its release was conjecture that Taylor Swift might have been involved with the movie thanks to the prominent presence of argyle patterns and a cat in the promotional materials. Despite plenty of online discussion, Swift had no involvement in the film.\n\nSecond place on the weekend went to the Christian drama series \u201cThe Chosen.\u201d The first three episodes of the fourth season of the series, which dramatizes the life of Jesus, played in 2,263 theaters. The Angel Studios release grossed $6 million Friday through Sunday.\n\nOn another quiet weekend in cinemas, the rest of ticket sales went mainly to holdovers and awards contenders.\n\nWarner Bros.\u2019 \u201cWonka,\u201d in its eighth week, crossed $200 million domestically.

Only 5.7% of the 1.3 million eligible voters cast ballots at the 39 voting stations around the city, the newspaper Le Monde said.\n\nIn get-out-the-vote posts on social media, Hidalgo argued that SUVs take up too much space on narrow Parisian streets, are too polluting and \u201cthreaten our health and our planet,\u201d and cause more traffic accidents than smaller cars.\n\n\u201cThe time has come to break with this tendency for cars that are always bigger, taller, wider,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have the power to take back ownership of our streets.\u201d\n\nThe cost for non-residents to park SUVs in Paris\u2019 central districts, in the arrondissements numbered 1 through 11, would soar to 18 euros ($19.5) per hour for the first two hours, compared to 6 euros per hour for smaller cars.\n\nAfter that, parking would become increasingly punitive. A six-hour stay with an SUV \u2014 enough, say, to take in a show and a restaurant \u2014 would cost a whopping 225 euros ($243), compared to 75 euros for smaller vehicles.\n\nAway from the heart of the city, in Paris\u2019 outer arrondissements numbered 12 through 20, an out-of-town SUV driver would pay 12 euros per hour for the first two hours, progressively rising to 150 euros for six hours.\n\nThe mini-referendum was open to Parisians registered to vote. The question they were asked was: \u201cFor or against the creation of a specific rate for the parking of heavy, bulky, polluting individual cars?\u201d\n\nCyreane Demur, a 20-year-old student, voted in the chic 8th arrondissement that includes that car-clogged Champs-Elys\u00e9es boulevard and its chaotic traffic circle around the monumental Arc de Triomphe.\n\nDemur said heavier cars make congestion \u201ceven more complicated\u201d and that \u201done must consider the ecology, the parking issues.\u201d\n\nBut Jadine L\u2019Orlendu, a 75-year-old voter, said SUVs \u201cdo not disturb me, they do not take more space than other cars, the parking places are marked, and people should drive what they want to drive. It\u2019s about freedom.\u201d\n\nThe vote follows another City Hall consultation last year on whether to ban for-hire electric scooters. The 15,000 opinion-dividing mini-machines were subsequently banished from Paris streets after nearly 90% of the 103,000 voters rejected e-scooters.\n\nIn a country of car-lovers, home to Renault, Citroen and Peugeot, Hidalgo has worked for years to make Paris less car-friendly. Motor vehicles have been barred entirely from some roads, most notably a River Seine embankment that used to be a busy highway. It\u2019s become a central Paris haven for cyclists, runners, families and romantics since Hidalgo closed it to motor traffic in 2016.\n\nMore bike lanes are being added for the July 26-Aug. 11 Olympics and Paralympic Games that follow.\n\nBut City Hall says that as car traffic has steadily decreased, down by half since the end of the 1990s, SUVs are denting the progress and fouling the air with their outsize dimensions. City Hall says that SUV collisions with pedestrians are twice as deadly than accidents involving smaller cars. It notes that two-thirds of Parisians now don\u2019t own a car.\n\nCity Hall\u2019s proposed ramped-up parking prices would apply to conventional or hybrid-engined SUVs from out of town that weigh 1.6 tons or more and 2 tons or more if they\u2019re fully electric.\n\n___\n\nLeicester reported from Le Pecq, France."}

(AP) \u2014 Wyndham Clark was declared the winner of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am on Sunday evening when the PGA Tour canceled the final round because of wicked weather conditions that would linger into the next day and cause safety concerns.\n\nClark's final stroke was a two-putt birdie from 25 feet on Saturday, giving him a course record 12-under 60 and a one-shot lead over Ludvig Aberg, who missed a long eagle putt on the par-5 18th hole.\n\nClark never had to hit another shot.\n\n\u201cIt's maybe not the way you dream of winning,\u201d Clark said in a conference call Sunday night. \u201cWith that said, a lot of us yesterday had ... not that we knew, but we definitely had this outside shot and thinking that maybe this is our last round.\u201d\n\nClark was six shots behind going into Saturday and said he was aiming for a top 10.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nOvernight rain saturated Pebble Beach, and raging wind that followed led the PGA Tour to postpone the final round with hopes of playing on Monday.\n\nThe storm, known as an \u201catmospheric river\u201d that pounded California for the second time, was to linger into Monday morning. While conditions were expected to improve, Monterey County emergency officials had urged residents to stay at home.\n\n\u201cOut of an abundance of caution for the safety of all constituents, there will be no play on Monday,\u201d the PGA Tour said in declaring the tournament 54 holes and Clark the winner.\n\nClark picked up his third win in the last nine months, all of them big with a $3.6 million payoff. He also won the Wells Fargo Championship and his first major at the U.S. Open last year at Los Angeles Country Club.\n\nHe didn't get to pose with the trophy on the 18th green. He didn't feel cheated out of appreciation, either, not the way the gallery responded to his close call at 59.\n\n\u201cEveryone was celebrating and congratulating me,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI even said to myself, \u2018This feels like I just won the tournament,\u2019 and yet we had another round to play. Today, waking up and they cancel the day, you\u2019re trying not to go too far in the future. I get a call that we\u2019re going to cancel and you\u2019re the winner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty surreal right now.\u201d\n\nBut it was a dreary start to the PGA Tour's new season of \u201csignature events\" on network television. Pebble Beach, among the most famous courses in the world, had its strongest field in decades. CBS was prepared for a telecast with the NFL not playing ahead of the Super Bowl.\n\nAnd then there was no golf.\n\nNearly an inch of rain overnight saturated Pebble Beach, which had received overnight rain going into Thursday and Friday. The rain cleared on Sunday, pushed by gusts that approached 60 mph and topped portable toilets and fences and ripped tarps away from TV towers. Also felled was a camera used for the ShotLink data collection.\n\nUnder PGA Tour guidelines, the final round could not have started on Monday if there was no chance of finishing it. Gary Young, the chief referee, had said that a \u201cdrop dead time\u201d to start would be 10:15 a.m. to be able to finish.\n\nThe decision came after consultation with Monterey County. Highway signs during the day recommended no travel until Monday night because of the severe weather.\n\nClark finished at 17-under 199.\n\nHe became the fifth player \u2014 all of them major champions \u2014 to win Pebble Beach over 54 holes since AT&T became title sponsor in 1986. The others were Dustin Johnson in 2009, Payne Stewart in 1999, Phil Mickelson in 1998 and Fuzzy Zoeller in 1986.\n\nStewart also birdied his final hole on Saturday the year the final round was wiped out by rain and a storm system that stretched from the Monterey Peninsula to Japan.\n\nClark is the first 54-hole winner on the PGA Tour since Brian Stuard in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans in 2016.\n\nPebble Beach was not a felicitous meeting of land and sea. Instead, it was an angry one. Golf Channel posted images of wild-blown waves crashing off the rocks on the 18th, the ocean spray going over the bunker and onto the fairway.\n\nThe PGA Tour already had been determined spectators would not be allowed if golf had been played Sunday. All tournament facilities at Pebble Beach remained closed.\n\nMatthieu Pavon of France finished third with a birdie on the last hole Saturday. Pavon was coming off a victory at Torrey Pines and his finish at Pebble moves him to No. 1 in the FedEx Cup. The season is five tournaments old, but it's no less amazing. Pavon last year birdied his last four holes to get the last of 10 PGA Tour cards offered to European tour players.\n\nMark Hubbard and Thomas Detry tied for fourth and each earned 312.5 points toward the FedEx Cup, more than a runner-up finish is worth in a regular tournament.\n\nNeither would have been eligible for Pebble Beach except the tour had to dip below 60th in last year's FedEx Cup to fill the field to 80 players because there were 80 amateurs for the opening two rounds.\n\n___"}

The government earlier said civilians were among 16 dead.\n\nIn Syria, the strikes killed 23 people who had been guarding the targeted locations, said Rami Abdulrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which reports on war in Syria.\n\nU.S. Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of the Joint Staff, said the attacks appeared to be successful, triggering large secondary explosions as the bombs hit militant weaponry. He said the strikes were undertaken knowing that there would likely be casualties among those in the facilities.\n\nDespite the strikes, the Pentagon has said it does not want war with Iran and does not believe Tehran wants war either, even as Republican pressure has increased on U.S. President Joe Biden to deal a blow directly.\n\nIran, which backs Hamas, has sought to stay out of the regional conflict itself even as it backs groups that have entered the fray from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria - the so-called \"Axis of Resistance\" that is hostile to Israel and U.S. interests.\n\n'WE DO NOT SEEK CONFLICT'\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said after the strikes that Biden had directed additional action against the IRGC and those linked to it. \"This is the start of our response,\" Austin said.\n\n\"We do not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else, but the president and I will not tolerate attacks on American forces,\" Austin said.\n\nAn Iraqi government statement said the areas bombed by U.S. aircraft included places where Iraqi security forces are stationed near civilian locations. It said 23 people had been wounded in addition to the 16 killed.\n\nThe White House said the United States had informed Iraq ahead of strikes. Baghdad later accused the United States of deception, saying a U.S. claim of coordination with the Iraqi authorities was \"unfounded\".\n\nOn Friday, Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi said his country will not start a war, but it will \"respond strongly\" to anyone who bullies it. He did not mention the U.S. strikes in a speech on Saturday marking Iran's space technology day.\n\nIran's ambassador in Damascus Hossein Akbari, in comments reported by the semi-official Fars news agency, played down the airstrikes, denying Iran-linked targets were hit and saying the aim was \"to destroy Syria's civil infrastructure\".\n\nHamas said Washington was pouring \"oil on the fire\".\n\nBritain called the United States its \"steadfast\" ally and said it supports Washington's right to respond to attacks.\n\nPolish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, arriving for an EU meeting in Brussels, said the U.S. strikes were the result of Iranian proxies \"playing with fire\".\n\nMORE THAN 160 ATTACKS ON U.S. TROOPS\n\nThe strikes hit targets including command and control centers, rockets, missiles and drone storage facilities, as well as logistics and munition supply chain facilities, the U.S. military said.\n\nIn Iraq, residents said several strikes hit the Sikak Neighborhood in Al-Qaim, a residential area that locals said was also used by armed groups to store large amounts of weapons. Militants had left the area and gone into hiding in the days since the Jordan attack, local sources said.\n\nKhaled Walid, a Sikak resident, said that the U.S. strikes and secondary explosions of munitions stored in the neighborhood had caused widespread damage.\n\nU.S. troops have been attacked over 160 times in Iraq, Syria and Jordan since Oct. 7, usually with a mix of rockets and one-way attack drones, prompting the United States to mount several retaliatory attacks even before the latest strikes.\n\nThe United States has assessed that the drone that killed the three soldiers and wounded more than 40 other people in Jordan was made by Iran, U.S. officials have told Reuters.\n\n\"Our response began today. It will continue at times and places of our choosing,\" Biden said.\n\nThe top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker, criticized Biden for failing to impose a high enough cost on Iran, and taking too long to respond.\n\nIranian advisers assist armed groups in both Iraq, where the United States has around 2,500 troops, and Syria, where it has 900.\n\n(Additional reporting by Enas Alashray, Adam Makary; Andrew Gray and Sabine Siebold in Brussels, Writing by Tom PerryEditing by Frances Kerry)"}

In 1763, the Treaty of Paris relegated the Mississippi region to the British.\n\nThe Mississippi Territory was organized in 1798, and it joined the Union as the 20th state in 1817. Through the mid-19th century, slave labor propelled Mississippi to become the top cotton producer in the country.\n\nThe Magnolia State was the second state to secede from the Union in 1861. The state\u2019s location alongside the Mississippi River made it a strategic military location during the Civil War. The state suffered greatly during the war, losing nearly 10,000 soldiers .\n\nThe 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, was ratified after three-fourths of the states passed it in 1865 at the close of the war. While four others eventually passed the amendment, Mississippi did not symbolically and officially adopt it until 1995 \u2013 and didn\u2019t officially notify Washington of the vote until 2013.\n\nBlues music originating in the Mississippi Delta after the Civil War was rooted in African spiritual music and songs slaves sang as they worked in the fields. The state became a hub of American music traditions at the center of gospel, jazz, country and rock and roll.\n\nRacial discrimination and segregation prevailed in Mississippi through the 20th century. Between 1915 and 1960 , about 5 million African Americans left the South, including hundreds of thousands from Mississippi.\n\nThe state was a battleground during the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century. In 1962, violent riots broke out on the Unversity of Mississippi campus when James Meredith, a Black Air Force veteran, attempted to integrate the all-white state university. In 1963, he became the university\u2019s first Black graduate.\n\nDuring the Freedom Summer of 1964 , Northern college students flocked to Mississippi to encourage African Americans to participate in the civil rights movement and help register them to vote. Their efforts raised awareness of discrimination in the Deep South and helped pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965."}

Gusts exceeding 80 mph (128 kph) were recorded in the mountains.\n\nJust to the south in San Jose, emergency crews pulled occupants out of the windows of a car stranded by floodwaters and rescued people from a homeless encampment alongside a rising river.\n\nThe storm then moved into Southern California, where officials warned of potentially devastating flooding and ordered evacuations for canyons that burned in recent wildfires that are at high risk for mud and debris flows.\n\nClasses were canceled Monday for schools across Santa Barbara County, which was devastated by mudslides caused by powerful storms in 2018.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nFurther down the coast, strong winds and heavy rain brought treacherous conditions to the city of Ventura, said Alexis Herrera, who was trying to bail out his sedan which was filled with floodwater. \u201cAll the freeways are flooded around here,\u201d Herrera said in Spanish. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to move my car.\u201d\n\nMore than 845,000 customers were without electricity statewide by Sunday evening, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nWinds caused hours-long delays at San Francisco International Airport.

Heavy snow was expected into Monday throughout the Sierra Nevada and motorists were urged to avoid mountain roads.\n\nMuch of the state had been drying out from the system that blew in last week, causing flooding and dumping welcome snow in mountains. The latest storm, also called a \u201cPineapple Express\u201d because its plume of moisture stretches back across the Pacific to near Hawaii, arrived offshore in Northern California on Saturday, when most of the state was under some sort of wind, surf or flood watch.\n\nThe weather service issued a rare \u201churricane force wind warning\u201d for the Central Coast, with wind gusts of up to 92 mph (148 kph) possible from the Monterey Peninsula to the northern section of San Luis Obispo County.\n\nMeanwhile, the southern part of the state was at risk of substantial flooding beginning late Sunday because of how slow the system was moving, said Ryan Kittell, a meteorologist at the weather service\u2019s Los Angeles-area office.\n\n\u201cThe core of the low pressure system is very deep, and it\u2019s moving very slowly and it\u2019s very close to us. And that\u2019s why we have those very strong winds. And the slow nature of it is really giving us the highest rainfall totals and the flooding risk,\u201d he said at a Sunday briefing.\n\nEvacuation orders and warnings were in effect for mountain and canyon areas of Monterey, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. LA County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath urged residents near wildfire burn areas of Topanga and Soledad canyons to heed orders to get out ahead of possible mudslides.\n\n\u201cIf you have not already left, please gather your family, your pets, your medications and leave immediately,\u201d Horvath said at a Sunday briefing. The county set up shelters where evacuees could spend the night.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services activated its operations center and positioned personnel and equipment in areas most at risk.\n\nThe storm was expected to move down the coast and bring heavy rain, possible flash-flooding and mountain snow to the Los Angeles area late Sunday, before moving on to hammer Orange and San Diego counties on Monday.\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation\u2019s second largest, said it was planning to open schools as usual Monday. The decision would be reevaluated at 6 a.m. Monday, said Superintendent Alberto Carvalho.\n\nThe weather service forecast up to 8 inches (20 cm) of rainfall across Southern California\u2019s coastal and valley areas, with 14 inches (35 cm) possible in the foothills and mountains.

Lee had denied wrongdoing in the current case, describing the 2015 merger as \u201cnormal business activity.\u201d\n\nLee, 56, did not answer questions from reporters as left the court.

He was originally sentenced for five years in prison for offering 8.6 billion won ($6.4 million) worth of bribes to then-President Park Geun-hye and her close confidante to win government support for the 2015 merger, which was key to strengthening his control over the Samsung business empire and solidifying the father-to-son leadership succession.\n\nLee was released on parole in 2021 and pardoned by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in August 2022, in moves that extended a history of leniency toward major white-collar crime in South Korea and preferential treatment for convicted tycoons.\n\nSome shareholders had opposed the 2015 merger, saying that it unfairly benefited the Lee family while hurting minority shareholders. There was also public anger over how the national pension fund\u2019s stake in Samsung C&T, the merged entity, fell by an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars, after Park had pressured the National Pension Service to support the deal.\n\nPark and her confidante were also convicted in the scandal and enraged South Koreans staged massive protests for months demanding an end to the shady ties between business and politics. The demonstrations eventually led to Park\u2019s ouster from office.\n\nLee has been navigating one of his toughest stretches as the leader of one of the world\u2019s largest makers of computer chips and smartphones, with Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and other geopolitical turmoil hurting the world economy and deflating technology spending.\n\nThe company last week reported an annual 34% decline in operating profit for October-December quarter as sluggish demands for its TVs and other consumer electronics products offset hard-won gains from a slowly revering memory chip market.\n\n___\n\nAP writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to the story."}

The electoral site updating the count crashed shortly before midnight.\n\nAfter casting his vote, Bukele made clear that he expects the newly elected Legislative Assembly to continue extending the special powers he has enjoyed since March 2022 to combat the gangs.\n\nLater, standing on the balcony of the National Palace, he said that the country had made history.\n\n\u201cWhy are there so many eyes on a small (Latin) American country?\u201d he asked thousands of supporters. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of the power of example.\u201d\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\n\u201cSalvadorans have given the example to the entire world that any problem can be solved if there is the will to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe self-described \u201cworld\u2019s coolest dictator\u201d appeared to sweep to victory after enjoying soaring approval ratings and virtually no competition. That came despite concerns that Bukele\u2019s government has slowly chipped away at checks and balances in his first term and accusations that he dodged a constitutional ban on reelection.\n\nAfter voting, he jousted with reporters, asserting that the election\u2019s results would serve as a \u201creferendum\u201d on what his administration has done.\n\n\u201cWe are not substituting democracy, because El Salvador never had democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first time in history that El Salvador has democracy. And I\u2019m not saying it, the people say it.\u201d\n\nBukele has been a highly popular leader and only more so since the government began its crackdown on the country's feared gangs.\n\nUnder a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d approved in March 2022, the government has arrested more than 76,000 people \u2014 more than 1% of the Central American nation\u2019s population. The asault on the gangs has spurred accusations of widespread human rights abuses and a lack of due process, but violence has plummeted in a country known just a few years ago as one of the most dangerous in the world.\n\nSara Leon, 48, was among throngs of people who flocked to El Salvador\u2019s previously gang-controlled downtown to celebrate. When she was 23, Leon risked her life to migrate from El Salvador to the United States with her 6-year-old daughter.\n\n\u201cIf the gangs saw a cute girl, they abducted her, abused her and killed her,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn't want that to happen to my daughter.\u201d\n\nShe returned to her homeland in October because of the \u201cstate of emergency.\u201d She said she now plans to buy a home here and hopes her daughter who has since moved to Toronto will be able to return.\n\n\u201cHe is a genius,\u201d she said of Bukele, tearing up when asked what his administration has meant. \u201cIf he's a dictator, may we have a dictator for 100 more years. May he stay in power. That is good if he's this way and continues governing the country the same way.\u201d\n\nBukele\u2019s popularity has also drawn eyes from across the region, and he and party are increasingly looked to as a case study for a wider global rise in authoritarianism.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Bukele has been accused of taking undemocratic steps that concentrated power in his hands, something observers have worried will only grow with Sunday\u2019s election.\n\nHe showed up in congress with soldiers while attempting to pass his agenda. After his party was victorious in 2021 legislative elections, the newly elected congress purged the constitutional court, replacing judges with loyalists. The new justices later ruled that Bukele could run for a second term despite the constitutional ban on reelection.\n\nBukele has also been accused of harassing and even detaining journalists, union organizers and political opponents.\n\nBut Bukele arrived on the scene when Salvadorans were craving change, when El Salvador\u2019s traditional parties \u2014 the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance and leftist Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front \u2014 alternating power for three decades were thoroughly discredited by deep corruption and ineffectiveness.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Bukele waded through a crowd to vote wearing a blue golf shirt and white baseball cap, while supporters chanted, \u201cFive more years! Five more years!\u201d\n\nSmiling, Bukele and his wife dropped their ballots into the box as R.E.M.\u2019s 1987 hit \u201cIt\u2019s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine),\u201d blared over speakers. Bukele has a habit of trolling his critics.\n\nThe charismatic leader has harnessed social media in a way few other leaders in the region have, using it as a tool to pump out propaganda, bolstered by an elaborate communications machine. Not appearing at a single campaign event before the election, he instead plastered videos taped from his couch on social media urging Salvadorans to vote for him so the opposition doesn\u2019t \u201cfree the gang members and use them to return to power.\u201d\n\nHe speaks with conviction about the changes he has made to El Salvador, describing the gangs as a \u201ccancer\u201d the nation had to battle in order to grow.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s coming in El Salvador is a period of prosperity, because now there\u2019s no stopping you from opening a business, no stopping you from studying, no stopping you from working,\u201d Bukele said Sunday.\n\nHe dismissed foreign criticism as promoting failed \u201crecipes\u201d and ignoring his administration\u2019s homegrown solution. He said now that voters had approved him for a second term, external observers don\u2019t have the right to describe his government as undemocratic.\n\nOpposition lawmaker Claudia Ortiz, of the party VAMOS, urged voters to support candidates outside Bukele\u2019s party in the legislative elections in order to preserve checks and balances.\n\n\u201cAbsolute power corrupts absolutely,\u201d she said in a video recorded from polling stations.\n\nBut Sunday night, Gesenia Garc\u00eda, the 26-year-old owner of a sorbet shop in Ilopango, said she saw things differently. She had hitched a ride with neighbors from the outskirts of the capital to celebrate.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment of happiness because before we lived in corruption and crime,\u201d they said. \u201cHe is the best that God could have sent to this country.\u201d\n\nGarc\u00eda said they had seen friends killed before their eyes under previous administrations. The traditional parties only brought corruption and bloodshed, she said.\n\n\u201cOur president is not unconstitutional because it is something the people made happen at the polls, nobody made me do it,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cHe is not unconstitutional. The parties of the past are unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nGarcia strolled through San Salvador with 5-year-old son and mother, beaming to be out on streets that not long ago were no-go zones for ordinary citizens. Even without a plan for how to get home, they walked trusting everything would work out."}

In November, she'll face cranky voters in a competitive reelection bid.\n\nSan Francisco is in a struggle to redefine itself after the pandemic left it in economic tatters and highlighted its longstanding problems with homelessness, drugs and property crime. Opponents say both ballot measures are wildly out of step with San Francisco's support for privacy and civil liberties and will only hurt the marginalized communities the city prides itself on helping.\n\nBut Breed, the first Black woman to lead San Francisco, said at a January campaign stop that residents from poorer, Black and immigrant neighborhoods are pleading for more police, and recovery advocates are demanding change as more than 800 people died of accidental overdose last year \u2014 a record fueled by the abundance of cheap and potent fentanyl.\n\n\u201cThey said San Francisco makes it too easy for people to access and to use drugs on the streets of the city and we need to do something a lot more aggressive,\u201d Breed said at Footprint, an athletic apparel and shoe store that has been repeatedly burglarized.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nWhile Breed's name isn't on the presidential primary ballots going out now \u2014 San Francisco uses a method where residents rank mayoral candidates by preference a single time in November \u2014 the two measures she's pushing are. They serve as an opening salvo for her reelection campaign as she faces off against fellow moderates who say her approach to the city's problems has been weak.\n\nViolent crimes are low in San Francisco, but the city has long struggled with quality-of-life crimes.\n\nBreed said rates of retail theft and auto smash-ins have declined recently, thanks in large part to strategic operations by city police. Similarly, police have stepped up enforcement of drug laws, including by issuing citations to people using drugs in public as a way to disrupt the behavior and an opportunity to persuade the person cited to seek help.\n\nBut she said San Francisco needs to do more.\n\nIf approved by voters, Proposition F would offer another way to compel treatment, by allowing the city to screen single adults on local welfare for substance abuse. People found to be abusing illegal drugs would be required to enroll in treatment if they want to receive cash assistance from the city, which maxes out at just over $700 a month.\n\nOpponents say coercion doesn't work and homelessness may increase if the measure passes. Drug addicts are not criminals, they say, and there are not enough treatment beds and counseling services as it is.\n\nA crackdown on drugs is reminiscent of the failed war on drugs that disproportionately harmed Black families, said Chris Ballard, co-executive director of Coleman Advocates, which pushes for improvements for Black and Latino youth in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThere are more ethical ways to address the issue aside from punitive measures, and that\u2019s the proper way to take care of a community, to show true support,\u201d he said.\n\nYet Trent Rhorer, executive director of the San Francisco Human Services Agency, which provides cash assistance and employment services to low-income residents without dependent children, said the current situation is in conflict with the agency's mission: to improve lives.\n\n\u201cTo give someone who\u2019s addicted to fentanyl $700 a month, I don\u2019t think it helps improve their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I think it does the opposite.\u201d\n\nCompelling treatment has become more acceptable in Democratic California, despite angst over the potential loss of civil liberties, as visible signs of homelessness and mental illness, fentanyl addiction, and unsafe street behavior surge.\n\nLast year, several counties rolled out an alternative mental health court created by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, former mayor of San Francisco, to fast-track people with untreated schizophrenia and related disorders into care, and in March voters will take up a statewide mental health proposition that some say will increase involuntary treatment.\n\nRhorer said the welfare program for single adults \u2014 which serves about 9,000 people per year \u2014 already asks applicants about substance abuse, with about 20% self-reporting an issue. A data check with the Department of Public Health revealed that almost one-third of recipients have been diagnosed with a substance use disorder, he said.\n\nThe ballot measure would replace that question with a more rigorous screening test that would be verified by an addiction specialist. If substance abuse is found, Rhorer said, the specialist and applicant would agree on treatment options that include residential care, a 12-step program, individual counseling and replacement medication.\n\nThere is no requirement that the person be sober, only that they make good-faith efforts to attend their program, with the hope that \u201cat one point a light bulb will go off,\u201d Rhorer said.\n\nThe measure calls for the city to pay the rent of those accepted into the program for 30 days or longer to avoid eviction. About 30% of the people who fatally overdosed in 2023 were homeless, and more were living in subsidized city housing.\n\nBesides authorizing drones, cameras and other modern technologies, Proposition E would reduce paperwork so police have more time to patrol. It would also allow police to pursue more suspects by vehicle, and not just in cases of a violent felony or immediate threat to public safety \u2014 a policy store owner Michael Hsu learned of the hard way.\n\nHsu has had his Footprint store broken into multiple times since he took over in 2020, most recently on Jan. 1. Police arrived as the suspects were leaving but could not pursue them because no lives were at risk. Hsu, who lost about $20,000 in merchandise and damage, called that discouraging.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sending the wrong message to these criminals,\u201d he said."}

Russia's government must approve deals involving foreign asset sales and demands a discount of at least 50%.\n\nFor the deal, Yandex's market capitalisation was calculated as $10.2 bln, based on a three-month weighted average for Yandex shares on Moscow Exchange. In late 2021, prior to Russia's invasion, Yandex's market capitalisation had approached $30 billion.\n\nAlmost 88% of Yandex's ownership structure is currently free-float, with many Western funds among its shareholders.\n\nYandex NV said the deal would consist of a cash equivalent of at least 230 billion roubles and up to around 176 million Yandex NV Class A shares.\n\n\"The cash consideration will be paid in Chinese Yuan (CNH) outside of Russia,\" Yandex NV said in a statement.\n\n'EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES'\n\nThe buyer, Consortium.First, is a newly formed investment fund managed by trustee Solid Management. The consortium was led by members of Yandex's senior management team in Russia and supported by four financial investors including Argonaut, an investment fund ultimately owned by Lukoil.\n\nThree other companies - Infinity Management, IT.Elaboration and Meridian-Servis - owned by Alexander Chachava, Pavel Prass and Alexander Ryazanov respectively, were also among the buyers, Yandex NV said.\n\nYandex NV made clear that no members of the consortium are under U.S., EU, UK or Swiss sanctions. That requirement has ruled out many other potential Russian buyers, sources have previously told Reuters.\n\nThe sale, once given regulatory and shareholder approval, is set to be completed in two stages, the first of which is anticipated to close in the first half of 2024, with the second stage following within seven weeks.\n\nYandex NV plans to delist its Class A shares from Moscow Exchange, expected after Yandex has obtained a new public listing.\n\nJohn Boynton, chairman of Yandex NV's board of directors, said the team had found the best possible solution for its shareholders and users in \"extraordinary circumstances\".\n\nYandex NV will retain a portfolio of four early-stage tech businesses in the cloud, data solutions, self-driving and education technology sectors.\n\nIt will also keep a data centre in Finland, as well as the \"core intellectual property asset\" of 1,300 employees, and transitional licences through 2024.\n\n($1 = 91.1500 roubles)\n\n(Reporting by Alexander Marrow, Darya Korsunskaya, Polina Devitt; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)"}

(AP) \u2014 Gov. Josh Shapiro is set to deliver a second budget proposal to Pennsylvania lawmakers on Tuesday with a firmer grasp on how he wants to pursue several top priorities, his state in a relatively strong fiscal position and lessons learned from last year's ugly budget fight.\n\nMost details of the Democratic governor's budget plan for the 2024-25 fiscal year, which starts July 1, remain under wraps. But Shapiro has made it clear he will seek more money for higher education and public transit agencies and possibly underfunded public schools.\n\nHe also wants to spend more money to attract major companies and seems ready to revisit the controversial item that helped sow a protracted budget fight last year: creating a new private school voucher program.\n\nShapiro's first budget proposal disappointed many allies who felt it wasn't bold enough. This year, he's returning with bigger proposals based on recommendations from his task forces or appointees.\n\nShapiro faces a number of cost pressures, too, from health care for the poor to county-run mental health services.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nOne other difference this year is that Shapiro is expected to deliver his budget address to a joint session of the House and Senate in the Capitol Rotunda. Governors historically deliver the speech in the House chamber, but workers have put up scaffolding there to repair damage from a water leak a year ago.\n\nWhatever Shapiro proposes will require passage from the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-controlled Senate. Appropriations Committee hearings start Feb. 20.\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch for Tuesday:\n\nTHE BUDGET BASICS\n\nShapiro will almost certainly propose an operating budget that spends above this year\u2019s $45 billion approved plan.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because an extra federal pandemic-era Medicaid subsidy, worth about $1 billion a year, is ending and Shapiro has said he wants to spend more money on several priorities.\n\nThose include nearly $300 million more for public transit agencies, a roughly 25% increase, and a substantial, but undisclosed, increase for state-owned universities.\n\nShapiro also wants to spend big to attract large industrial facilities, such as a microchip factory, by getting large tracts of land permitted and prepared for construction.\n\n\u201cWe need to invest if we want to compete nationally and internationally,\u201d Shapiro said last month.\n\nAlso, pressure is on Shapiro to respond more fully to last year\u2019s court decision that found Pennsylvania\u2019s system of funding public schools violates the constitutional rights of students in poorer districts.\n\nLast month, Shapiro\u2019s appointees backed a non-binding recommendation to send $1.3 billion more next year to public schools, including subsidies for high-tax districts and school construction. He hasn't said whether his budget proposal will reflect that recommendation.\n\nTHE FISCAL SITUATION\n\nTax collections are meeting expectations and Shapiro has a strong cash cushion, for now.\n\nThe state expects to have $13 billion in cash when the fiscal year ends June 30, thanks to federal COVID-19 aid over the past four years and inflation-juiced tax collections that filled up the state's treasury.\n\nMeanwhile, a credit rating upgrade in November was Pennsylvania's first since it drew six downgrades between 2012 and 2017, including two by each of the big three rating agencies, while grappling with entrenched post-recession deficits.\n\nStill, Pennsylvania is running deficits again, using $1 billion in surplus cash to prop up this year's spending.\n\nThe state also is saddled with a slow-growing economy and grim demographic trends showing a shrinking working-age population and a fast-growing retirement-age population that pays less in taxes and costs more to care for.\n\nSHAPIRO'S PRIORITIES\n\nShapiro has made a list of items that he considers to be unfinished business.\n\nThat includes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which Republicans have blocked in the Senate, and creating a new $100 million private school voucher program that Democrats in the House have blocked.\n\nThe voucher program is particularly radioactive for Democrats and Shapiro's support for it sets him apart from other Democratic governors around the country.\n\nLike 19 other states, Pennsylvania's minimum wage is at the federal minimum of $7.25.\n\nTAXES\n\nShapiro has said he will propose a budget that cuts taxes, without offering further details.\n\nShapiro and lawmakers in December approved an increase in the monthly fee on phone bills, from $1.65 to $1.95, to raise another $60 million for county 911 emergency response services.\n\nOTHER COST PRESSURES\n\nSchool boards say they are paying too much to charter schools and Democratic lawmakers are pushing to restart a dormant program subsidizing school construction projects.\n\nMeanwhile, providers of services for the intellectually disabled and autistic say the system is beset by underfunding and staffing shortages.\n\nCounties say the safety-net mental health services they manage are in dire need of more money to create more beds and attract more counselors for waiting lists of people who need help.\n\n___\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X, formerly Twitter, at www.twitter.com/timelywriter."}

Democrats hold every statewide office and dominate the Legislature, while Democratic voters outnumber registered Republicans by an overwhelming 2-to-1.\n\nYet pockets of conservative strength remain, particularly in the Southern California suburbs and the Central Valley farm belt. As in 2022, the most competitive contests are concentrated in Republican-held districts that were carried by then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020 \u2014 genuinely competitive territory is diminishing nationally.\n\nLeaders in both parties agree that the outcome in California could be the lever that determines who holds the gavel in 2025, after GOP wins in 2022 helped the party gain control. Currently, the House has 219 Republicans, 213 Democrats and three vacancies.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is among those raising money to help his party retake the House. He\u2019s warning of a \u201cdisastrous future\u201d if former President Donald Trump wins the White House and Republicans take charge in the Senate. Under that scenario, Democrats must have the House to have any chance of blocking Trump\u2019s agenda, Newsom warns.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nIf Democrats win four GOP-held districts in the state \u201cwe\u2019re going to flip the House in November,\u201d Newsom wrote in a recent fundraising pitch. \u201cAnd each of them has a very good chance.\u201d\n\nWith the state's Democratic tilt, Republicans hold only 11 of the state\u2019s 52 House seats. In all, about 10 districts appear to be in play statewide and in some cases the primary election could end up resulting in rematches from two years ago. No incumbents appear in imminent peril.\n\nVoting is about to start, with a Monday deadline for counties to mail ballots.\n\nIn the emerging fray, fear of the opposition animates the sales pitch. Democrats are warning about Trump\u2019s possible return to Washington, threats to abortion rights and unchecked gun violence. Republicans fault the party that dominates state politics for high taxes, inflation, vexing crime rates and an out-of-control homeless crisis.\n\nIt's unknown to what degree the presidential contest will trickle into House races. Turnout could be depressed if President Joe Biden and Trump appear assured of the nominations. Biden\u2019s popularity has faded in the state and nationally, and Trump is widely loathed in California outside his loyal base.\n\nUnder California election rules, Democrats and Republicans appear on the same primary ballot and the two candidates with the most votes advance to the general election, regardless of political party.\n\nTHE SURVIVOR: A GOP CONGRESSMAN IN DEMOCRATIC LA COUNTY\n\nRep. Mike Garcia is the last Republican congressman anchored in heavily Democratic Los Angeles County. The once-conservative 27th District running through suburbs and high desert north of Los Angeles has become one of the country\u2019s most competitive battlefields.\n\nThe district has a 12-point Democratic registration edge but over three elections Garcia has shown an uncanny ability to overcome the odds and confound rivals. It hasn't been easy \u2014 Garcia was reelected in 2020 by 333 votes.\n\nThe former Navy fighter pilot and Trump supporter with a reliably conservative voting record was first elected running against California\u2019s liberal-leaning government: \u201cI don\u2019t want my country to turn into what my state has become.\"\n\nGarcia's military service \u2014 he flew over 30 combat missions during Operation Iraqi Freedom \u2014 would play well in a district that is home to defense industries and popular with veterans and Los Angeles police officers and firefighters. The son of a Mexican immigrant father, his Hispanic surname is likely a benefit in a district with a significant Latino population. He also has displayed a keen ear for local issues, including concerns over crime and illegal marijuana cultivation.\n\nThe leading Democrat in the primary is George Whitesides, a former NASA chief of staff supported by the campaign arm of House Democrats. He's been stressing abortion rights and environmental protection and labeling Garcia as out of step with the district.\n\nA TOSS-UP DISTRICT THAT WAS ONCE THE HEART OF \u2018REAGAN COUNTRY\u2019\n\nOrange County\u2019s 47th District runs along the California coast southeast of Los Angeles and was once the heart of \u201cReagan Country,\u201d a region long synonymous with conservative politics and known for its ties to the former president. But the county that was once largely white and Republican has grown demographically diverse and increasingly Democratic, and the seat being vacated by Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, a U.S. Senate candidate, is up for grabs.\n\nRepublicans consider it a top target.\n\nFormer legislator Scott Baugh, who narrowly lost to Porter in 2022, is the leading Republican, while two Democrats are dueling to get on the November ballot, state Sen. David Min and Joanna Weiss, who founded an organization that promotes progressive candidates.\n\nA STRONGLY DEMOCRATIC DISTRICT THAT VOTES REPUBLICAN\n\nThe Central Valley farm belt is a political conundrum. Districts in the sprawling region sometimes called America's salad bowl typically have significant Democratic registration edges, but those seats are often held by Republicans.\n\nA case in point is Rep. David Valadao, a Republican who has endured despite facing steep registration deficits. Democrats hold a 16-point advantage in his 22nd District. He held his seat from 2013 until January 2019, lost it for a term, then won it back in a 2020 rematch with Democrat T.J. Cox.\n\nHe might be headed toward a rematch in November with Rudy Salas, the Democrat he defeated in 2022 who is backed by the campaign arm of House Democrats. Valadao has stressed an independent streak, while spotlighting his efforts to secure more water for farmers, a perennial issue in the Central Valley. Salas, considered a moderate, has depicted Valadao as a Trump acolyte masquerading as a centrist.\n\nBoth Salas and Valadao are facing rivals from within their own party on the primary ballot. Republican rancher Chris Mathys is looking to surprise Valadao and state Sen. Melissa Hurtado is competing for Democratic votes with Salas.\n\nROUND TWO IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY\n\nRepublican John Duarte defeated Democrat Adam Gray in 2022 in what was then a new House district in the Central Valley. He won by only 564 votes, the closest congressional contest in the state that year.\n\nThey are the only candidates on the March 5 primary election ballot, setting up a rematch in the 13th District, which has a prominent Democratic tilt and a large Latino population. But the most likely voters tend to be white, older, more affluent homeowners, as is the case statewide.\n\nGray, who is backed by the campaign arm of House Democrats, argues that his party can\u2019t reclaim the House majority without winning his district.\n\nANOTHER POTENTIAL REMATCH EAST OF LOS ANGELES\n\nRep. Ken Calvert, the longest-serving Republican in the California congressional delegation, held off Democrat Will Rollins, a former federal prosecutor, in a district east of Los Angeles by about 5 points in 2022. That district, the 41st, is about equally divided between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nThis year could see a rematch.\n\nCalvert brings the advantages of incumbency but his conservative credentials and support from Trump could be liabilities in a district that includes many transplanted Los Angeles residents and the city of Palm Springs, which has a large concentration of LGBTQ voters. Rollins is gay.\n\nRollins, who is backed by the campaign arm of House Democrats, says it's time for new leadership and has depicted Calvert as an extremist.\n\nSOUTH KOREAN IMMIGRANT LOOKS FOR ANOTHER TERM IN DISTRICT CREATED TO EMPOWER ASIANS\n\nRepublican Rep. Michelle Steel, a South Korean immigrant, is looking for another term in a Southern California district specifically drawn to give Asian Americans a stronger voice on Capitol Hill. Asian Americans comprise the largest group in the 45th District, anchored in Orange County. Democrats hold a modest registration edge.\n\nSteel first won the seat in 2020, then prevailed in 2022 with a 5-point win in the district, which includes the nation\u2019s largest Vietnamese community.\n\nFour Democrats are competing this year, including Kim Nguyen-Penaloza, the daughter of a Vietnamese refugee father and a Mexican immigrant mother who was endorsed by the state Democratic Party, and lawyer and worker rights advocate Derek Tran, the son of Vietnamese refugees.\n\nIn Congress, Steel has been outspoken in resistance to tax increases, says she stands strongly with Israel in its war with Hamas and sponsored a bill that would expand oversight related to foreign money in higher education, which passed the House last year.\n\nThe race will be watched nationally for hints about the preferences of Asian American voters.\n\nDEMOCRAT DEFENDS COASTAL DISTRICT WITH STRONG MILITARY TIES\n\nFour Republicans are on the ballot in the 49th District running through Orange and San Diego counties, where Democratic Rep. Mike Levin is looking for another term.\n\nCoastal California typically leans Democratic, but the race is seen as competitive. In 2022, Levin got a late-hour visit from Biden in hopes of boosting his chances and notched a 5-point win.\n\nIn Congress, Levin has focused on veterans affairs, as well as climate change and the environment, in a district that straddles Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.\n\nKey issues in the race have included immigration, housing and inflation.\n\n\u201cThe American people need leadership from Congress, not continued Republican chaos,\" Levin said in a tweet. \u201cHouse Democrats are ready to find common ground and a bipartisan path forward.\u201d"}

He decided he would research the history of two long-neglected sentences in the post-Civil War addition that prohibit those who \u201cengaged in insurrection or rebellion\u201d from holding office.\n\nMagliocca posted a copy of his research \u2014 which he believed was the first law journal article ever written about Section 3 of the 14th Amendment \u2014 online in mid-December of 2020, then revised and re-posted it on Dec. 29. Eight days later, President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol to prevent the certification of his loss to Joe Biden. Magliocca watched as Republicans such as Sens. Mitch McConnell and Mitt Romney described the attack as an \u201cinsurrection.\u201d\n\nThat night, Magliocca composed a quick post on a legal blog: \u201cSection Three of the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmight apply to President Trump.\u201d\n\nJust over four years later, the U.S. Supreme Court will have to determine whether it does. On Thursday, the nation's highest court is scheduled to hear arguments over whether Trump can remain on the ballot in Colorado, where the state's Supreme Court ruled that he violated Section 3.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nIt's the first time in history that the nation's highest court has heard a case on Section 3, which was used to keep former Confederates from holding government offices after the amendment's 1868 adoption. It fell into disuse after Congress granted an amnesty to most ex-rebels in 1872.\n\nBefore the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, even many constitutional lawyers rarely thought about Section 3, a provision that isn't taught at most law schools and hadn't been used in court for more than 100 years. Legal scholars believe the only time it was cited in the 20th century was to deny a seat in Congress to a socialist on the grounds that he opposed U.S. involvement in World War I.\n\nThe clause's revival is due to an unlikely combination of Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, all rediscovering 111 words in the nation's foundational legal document that have now become a threat to the former president's attempt to return to office.\n\nTHE FIRST TARGETS\n\nOnce she had dried her tears after watching rioters storm the Capitol, Norma Anderson sat down with one of the multiple copies of the Constitution she keeps around her house in the Denver suburbs and reread the 14th Amendment.\n\n\u201cI made the connection,\u201d Anderson, now 91, said in an interview.\n\nAnderson is a former Republican leader of Colorado's General Assembly and state Senate, and eventually would become the lead plaintiff in the case now before the Supreme Court. The evening of Jan. 6, she read the provision that prohibited anyone who swore an oath to \u201csupport\u201d the Constitution and later \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d against it, or provided \u201caid and comfort\u201d to its enemies, from holding office.\n\nAnderson didn't yet have the chance to spread the word beyond her own circle, but in the days after Jan. 6, thanks to scholars such as Magliocca and the University of Maryland law professor whose book project had inspired him, Mark Graber, Section 3 started its slow emergence from obscurity.\n\n\u201cWe were the two people doing a little work on Section 3,\u201d Graber said of Magliocca and himself. \u201cWe thought this is real interesting; it makes great chitchat at the American Legal Historians Society.\u201d He added, \u201cThen Donald Trump did academics a favor.\u201d\n\nThough the provision was occasionally mentioned, conversation in Washington and the legal profession in general remained dominated by Trump's second impeachment \u2014 where he was acquitted by the Senate after 43 Republicans voted not to convict him.\n\nIt took months before the first mention of Section 3 in a public document. Free Speech For People, a Massachusetts-based liberal nonprofit, sent letters to top election officials in all 50 states in June 2021, warning them not to place Trump on the ballot should he run again in 2024 because he had violated the provision.\n\nThe group didn't hear back from any of them.\n\n\u201cPeople were just treating it as something that was not serious,\u201d recalled John Bonifaz, the group's co-founder.\n\nIn January 2022, Free Speech For People filed a complaint in North Carolina to disqualify Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn under Section 3 for his involvement in the rally that preceded the Capitol attack. But Cawthorn lost his primary in that year's midterms, mooting the case.\n\nAt the same time, another liberal watchdog group was starting its own Section 3 campaign.\n\nAfter Jan. 6, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, also known as CREW, in Washington was focused on Trump's impeachment and other possible legal penalties against those who participated in the Capitol attack before exploring other remedies, said its chief counsel, Donald Sherman.\n\nBy January 2022, the group decided to test Section 3 in court.\n\n\u201cIt wasn't just Trump we were focused on,\u201d Sherman said in an interview. \u201cOne thing we've been very careful about is we don't think it's appropriate to pursue outside or longshot cases.\u201d\n\nLooking for a lower-level defendant, Sherman's organization zeroed in on Couy Griffin. The subject of one of the earliest Jan. 6 prosecutions, Griffin already has a rich legal record. He was was recorded in a restricted area of the U.S. Capitol as head of a group called Cowboys for Trump. Griffin was convicted of illegally entering the Capitol, but acquitted of engaging in disorderly conduct.\n\nHe still served as a commissioner in a rural New Mexico county, which kept CREW's attention on him. On Sept. 6, 2022, a New Mexico judge ordered Griffin removed from his position. It was the first time in more than 100 years an official had been removed under Section 3. Griffin has appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nCREW prepared to turn to other Section 3 targets. But it quickly became clear Trump would be next. He announced his campaign for president on Nov. 15, 2022.\n\n\u2018IS THIS FOR REAL?\u2019\n\nBoth Free Speech For People and CREW had similar discussions about how to challenge a presidential candidacy. They knew the complaints would have to come at the state level because federal courts have ruled that citizens can't challenge presidential criteria in that venue.\n\nThe two groups began scouring state ballot laws, looking for a place that allowed the rapid contesting of a candidacy. CREW settled on Colorado. It had a clear process for a quick challenge in trial court that would be fast-tracked on appeal to the state Supreme Court.\n\nAfter a brief trip to Denver checking on potential local lawyers to lead the challenge, Sherman and another CREW attorney, Nikhel Sus, contracted Martha Tierney, a veteran election lawyer who also served as general counsel of the state Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cHmm, that's a longshot,\u201d Tierney recalled thinking. She signed up, anyway.\n\nTierney wasn't acting as the Democratic Party's lawyer, but CREW wanted to balance its team with someone from the right. Sherman reached out to Mario Nicolais, a former Republican election lawyer who had left the party over Trump.\n\nNicolais' first interaction with Sherman was a direct message about the case on X, the social media network previously known as Twitter. Nicolais thought it could be from a crank.\n\n\u201cIs this for real or is this from somebody just angry at the president?\u201d Nicolais recalled wondering.\n\nThen he saw Sherman was with CREW. \u2014 an organization he considered serious. In Nicolais' office hangs a copy of his first appearance on the front page of The Denver Post, when he beat CREW's local chapter in a case before the Colorado Supreme Court.\n\nNicolais was in charge of recruiting plaintiffs. The attorneys wanted Republicans and independents, not only because they were eligible to vote in Colorado's Republican primary but also to keep the case from being seen as partisan. Anderson, the former state lawmaker, signed on right away.\n\nOn Sept. 6, 2023 \u2014 one year from the disqualification of the New Mexico county commissioner \u2014 Anderson's was the lead name of the six plaintiffs on the 105-page complaint filed in district court in Denver.\n\nA HISTORIC RULING\n\nScott Gessler got the call from Trump's team that day. A former Colorado secretary of state, Gessler was one of the go-to Republican election lawyers in the state.\n\nTrump's campaign had been fending off scores of Section 3 lawsuits across the country, often from fringe players such as John Castro, a write-in Republican presidential candidate from Texas who had filed numerous ones against Trump.\n\nThis case was more serious. The Denver judge who got CREW's complaint, Sarah Block Wallace, said she was obligated to hold a hearing under Colorado election law.\n\nIn the five-day hearing, which took place in late October and early November, two officers who defended the Capitol testified, along with a University of California professor who was an expert in right-wing extremism, two Trump aides and several other witnesses. One was Magliocca, who laid out the history of Section 3.\n\nTrump's attorneys were pessimistic, expecting Wallace, who had a history of donating to Democrats, to rule against them. Trump's top spokesman, Jason Miller, addressed reporters outside court, complaining that the plaintiffs had intentionally filed in a liberal jurisdiction in a blue state.\n\nTrump's lawyers filed a motion asking Wallace step aside because before becoming a judge, she had made a $100 donation to a liberal group that had declared Jan. 6 was an \u201cinsurrection.\u201d She declined.\n\n\u201cI will not allow this legal proceeding to turn into a circus,\u201d Wallace said as the hearing began.\n\nTestimony was occasionally interrupted by sirens from a fire station around the corner from Wallace's courtroom. Security was an ever-present concern. About a half-dozen sheriff\u2019s deputies stood guard throughout the trial, and the plaintiffs had reached out to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nTo handle much of the examination and argument, Tierney and Nicolais had brought on a new firm of trial lawyers, whose lead partner was former Colorado Solicitor General Eric Olson.\n\nWallace issued her decision on Nov. 17. She ruled that Trump had \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d but found that \u2014 contrary to Magliocca's testimony \u2014 it wasn't certain that the authors of the 14th Amendment meant it to apply to the president. Section 3 refers to \u201celector of President and Vice President,\u201d but not specifically to the office itself.\n\nWallace was hesitant to become the first judge in history to bar a top presidential contender from the ballot unless the law was crystal clear.\n\n\u201cIt was a loss that only a lawyer could love,\u201d Sus recalled.\n\nCREW was just a legal sliver away from victory \u2014 it just needed the Colorado Supreme Court to uphold all of Wallace's ruling besides the technicality of whether the president was covered.\n\nA COURT DIVIDED\n\nThe seven justices of the state's high court \u2014 all appointed by Democrats from a pool chosen by a nonpartisan panel \u2014 peppered both sides with pointed questions at oral argument three weeks later.\n\nOlson and another partner from his firm, Jason Murray, argued for the plaintiffs. Murray had the rare distinction of having clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, a member of the court's liberal bloc, and Justice Neil Gorsuch, a member of its conservative bloc.\n\nGessler handled the argument for Trump. At the end of the grueling session, he addressed the meaning of insurrection and summed up the unprecedented, improvised nature of the case.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me, \u2018Mr. Gessler, you\u2019re making it up,\u2019\u201d Gessler told the justices. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you, well, so did the judge. And at the end of the day, we all are to a certain extent.\u201d\n\nNeither side left feeling certain of victory.\n\nOn Dec. 19, the court announced it would issue its ruling that afternoon. Sean Grimsley, one of Olson's law partners who also had argued the case, was in Washington, at the memorial service for former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, for whom he had clerked.\n\nThe ruling, which was 4-3, came down while Grimsley was on the flight back, frantically checking his phone via the plane's wi-fi. They had won. Grimsley leapt from his seat and dashed back several rows, where he high-fived a fellow O'Connor clerk who was on the flight.\n\nEight days later, Maine's Democratic secretary of state barred Trump from that state's ballot under Section 3. That decision and Colorado's are on hold until the U.S. Supreme Court rules.\n\nThe reaction to Colorado and Maine's decisions has been furious, especially from Republicans. Trump has decried them as \u201celection interference\u201d and \u201canti-democratic.\u201d They have warned that, if they stand, they could open the door to challenges of other politicians under Section 3, including Biden for not sufficiently defending the nation's southern border.\n\nSherman, who chafes at the notion that his nonpartisan group works on Democrats' behalf, notes that several Republican lawyers, former judges, members of Congress and governors have filed briefs with the Supreme Court backing them. In contrast, Sherman said he has heard grumbling from Democrats that the case risks replacing Trump with a Republican who would be harder to beat in this year's election.\n\nFree Speech For People has filed Section 3 cases against Trump in five states. None has succeeded, with every legal entity ruling that it doesn't have the authority to decide whether to remove Trump from the ballot. The Minnesota Supreme Court, for example, kept Trump on that state's ballot by ruling that state law allows political parties to put whomever they want on their primary ballot.\n\nWith most jurisdictions dodging the questions at the heart of the case, it can create a misleading impression that things have gone well for the former president.\n\n\u201cThe cases have gone poorly for Trump,\u201d Derek Muller, a Notre Dame law professor who has followed the cases closely, wrote Friday in a blog post. \u201cHe lost on the merits in the only two jurisdictions that got to the merits, Colorado and Maine.\u201d\n\nNext up is the one that matters most."}

(AP) \u2014 A Michigan jury will get instructions from a judge and begin deliberations Monday in a novel trial against a school shooter's mother who could go to prison if convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of four students in 2021.\n\nProsecutors say Jennifer Crumbley was grossly negligent when she failed to tell Oxford High School officials that the family had guns, including a 9 mm handgun that was used by her son, Ethan Crumbley, at a shooting range just a few days earlier.\n\nThe school was concerned about a macabre drawing of a gun, bullet and wounded man, accompanied by desperate phrases, on a math assignment. But Ethan was allowed to stay in school on Nov. 30, 2021, following a roughly 12-minute meeting with Jennifer and James Crumbley, who didn't take him home.\n\nThe teenager pulled the gun from his backpack in the afternoon and shot 10 students and a teacher, killing four peers. No one had checked the backpack.\n\n\u201cHe literally drew a picture of what he was going to do. It says, \u2018Help me,\u2019\u201d prosecutor Karen McDonald said during closing arguments Friday in suburban Detroit.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nJennifer Crumbley knew the gun in the drawing was identical to the new one at home, McDonald said.\n\n\u201cShe knew it wasn't stored properly,\" the prosecutor added. \u201cShe knew that he was proficient with the gun. She knew he had access to ammunition.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the smallest steps\u201d by Jennifer Crumbley could have saved the lives of Hana St. Juliana, Tate Myre, Justin Shilling and Madisyn Baldwin, the prosecutor said.\n\nDefense attorney Shannon Smith told jurors that a conviction would have a chilling effect on unwitting parents whose kids break the law. The tragedy, she argued, was not foreseeable.\n\nEthan Crumbley was a \u201cskilled manipulator\u201d who didn\u2019t have mental illness, and the gun was the responsibility of James Crumbley, not Jennifer, Smith said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately this is a case where the prosecution made a charging decision way too fast,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt was motivated by obvious reasons, for political gain and done for media attention.\u201d\n\nShe said the case won\u2019t bring justice to the victims or their families: \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t bring back any lives.\u201d\n\nJennifer Crumbley, 45, and James Crumbley, 47, are the first parents in the U.S. to be charged in a mass school shooting committed by their child. The latter faces trial in March.\n\nThe maximum penalty for involuntary manslaughter is 15 years in prison. The Crumbleys have been in jail for more than two years, unable to post $500,000 bond while awaiting trial.\n\nEthan Crumbley, now 17, pleaded guilty to murder and terrorism and is serving a life sentence.\n\nBesides knowledge of the gun, the Crumbleys are accused of ignoring their son's mental health needs. In a journal found by police in his backpack, he wrote that they wouldn't listen to his pleas for help.\n\n\u201cI have zero help for my mental problems and it\u2019s causing me to shoot up the ... school,\u201d Ethan wrote.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ed White on X, formerly Twitter, at https://twitter.com/edwritez"}

Kevin Stitt as they return on Monday to begin the 2024 legislative session.\n\nStitt, a Republican and himself a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, has had a contentious relationship with tribal leaders that began with a dispute during his first year in office over casino revenue and has worsened with conflict over agreements on tobacco sales, motor vehicle tags, taxes and criminal jurisdiction.\n\nThe governor, now in his second term, has been a frequent critic of expanded tribal sovereignty and of the landmark 2020 U.S. Supreme Court decision that determined state prosecutors lack criminal jurisdiction over certain crimes committed in Indian Country.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press last week, Stitt said his role is to represent all 4 million Oklahomans and not allow tribal citizens to have an unfair advantage.

Brent Howard, chairman of the Joint Committee on State-Tribal relations.\n\nAmong the other issues lawmakers are expected to tackle is a possible income tax cut, a top priority for Stitt. The House approved a 0.25% reduction in the rate last week, but Senate leaders have said such a move is premature since final revenue numbers haven't been released."}

But bipartisan negotiators are laboring to sell the package as part of a last-ditch effort to approve money for Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia, emphasizing that Congress has the best chance in years to make changes to U.S. immigration law.\n\nThe bill would also send military aid to Israel, funding for allies in the Asia-Pacific and humanitarian aid for refugees fleeing Gaza.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden has worked toward the deal with Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate, it faces a difficult, if not impossible, path to passage. Echoing opposition from their House counterparts, Republican senators have said the border policy doesn't go far enough and questioned additional aid to Ukraine. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called it \u201can easy NO.\u201d\n\nThe package has also drawn strong opposition from Donald Trump, the likely Republican presidential nominee.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nSome Democrats are also expected to oppose the deal. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said he opposes changes that it would make to the asylum process. \u201cThis border deal misses the mark,\u201d Padilla said in a statement.\n\nHere's what to know about the package:\n\nBillions for U.S. Allies and National Security\n\nThe package contains $60 billion in aid for Ukraine and $14 billion for Israel. It would invest in domestic defense manufacturing, bolster humanitarian assistance and manage the influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. In addition, $10 billion would aid humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and other places.\n\nThe package would also send $20 billion to immigration enforcement, providing money to hire thousands more officers to evaluate asylum claims, add hundreds of more Border Patrol agents and help stop the flow of fentanyl.\n\nToughened Asylum Process\n\nThe bill would overhaul the asylum system with tougher standards and faster enforcement.\n\nAsylum offers protection to people fleeing persecution for race, religion, political affiliation or membership in a discriminated group. It is part of international law and helps the U.S. protect human rights, but the system has become overwhelmed in recent years with historic numbers of people seeking asylum at the border with Mexico.\n\nUnder the proposal, migrants would have to show during initial screenings that they have a reasonable possibility of being granted asylum. Migrants would also be barred from making an asylum claim if they are found to have a criminal history, resettled in another country or could have found safety if they had resettled in their home country.\n\nMigrants who cross the border illegally between a port of entry would be detained and receive a screening within 10 to 15 days.\n\nMigrants who pass the new screening would then receive a work permit, be placed in a supervision program and have their asylum case decided within 90 days. And migrants who seek asylum in between ports of entry would be put into detention while they await the initial screening for an asylum claim. The proposal calls for a large growth in detention capacity.\n\nThe proposal also calls for a large expansion of a Biden administration program that tracks families who arrive at the border while they await the screenings for their asylum claim. The program was developed as an alternative to detention for families.\n\nImmigration advocates have raised concerns about the asylum changes, saying the current standard is deliberately low because migrants are often fleeing desperate conditions, don\u2019t have legal representation and are still shaken by their journeys.\n\nBorder Enforcement\n\nUnder the proposal, migrants would not be able to apply for asylum at all if illegal border crossings reach certain numbers.\n\nThe policy is similar to one first used by President Donald Trump. Known as Title 42, it justified the quick expulsion of migrants from the country in the name of stopping the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe bill proposes a similar expulsion authority if the number of migrant encounters tallied by Customs and Border Protection reaches 4,000 a day over a five-day average across the Southern border. Once the number of encounters reaches 5,000, expulsions would automatically take effect. For context, border encounters topped 10,000 on some days during December, which was the highest month on record for illegal crossings.\n\nUnder the proposal, migrants could still apply at ports of entry. And once the average of illegal crossings dropped by 75%, the administration would have two weeks to end the use of the emergency authority.\n\nSupporters of Title 42's use say it was a necessary tool that allowed border officials to expel migrants quickly and freed them up to patrol the territory they were supposed to protect. But critics have questioned how effective Title 42 really was. They say it's hard to get an accurate picture because migrants ejected under Title 42 would try repeatedly to cross the border. Critics also say it empowered cartels that preyed on the buildup of migrants south of the border.\n\nIf migrants facing expulsion raise concerns with border patrol officers that they could be persecuted if returned specifically to Mexico, they could still be allowed to apply for asylum.\n\nLimits on Presidential Immigration Authority\n\nThe legislation would place limits on how presidential administrations can use \u201cparole\u201d to allow migrants into the country at the border. It would eliminate parole as it is used when migrants cross the border illegally or show up at ports of entry, and instead place them into the new system for evaluating asylum claims.\n\nThe Biden administration would still be able to schedule asylum screenings through an app. Also, the administration's authority to allow people into the country when they are fleeing unrest or war would be preserved. The authority, known as humanitarian parole, had been a sticking point in the negotiations.\n\nAid for Migrants, Cities, States\n\nWhile progressive and Hispanic Democrats have raised concerns that the package will harm migrants seeking asylum, the legislation offers some measures aimed at helping migrants already in the U.S. and the cities and states where they've gone. It would send $1.4 billion to local programs like shelters that have seen large influxes of migrants and speed work permits for migrants awaiting an asylum claim.\n\nThe legislation would also authorize sanctions and anti-money laundering tools against criminal enterprises that traffic fentanyl into the U.S. And it would provide 50,000 visas for employment and family-based immigration each year for the next five years.\n\nHowever, the bill does not contain broad immigration reforms or deportation protections for unauthorized immigrants that were foundational to previous Senate deals.\n\nPathway for Afghan Allies\n\nThe legislation would also have a pathway to residency for Afghans who worked alongside U.S. soldiers in America\u2019s longest war. Nearly 76,000 Afghans who worked with American soldiers since 2001 as translators, interpreters and partners arrived in the U.S. on military planes after American troops were removed from Afghanistan in August 2021.\n\nThe provision would eventually enable qualified Afghans to apply for U.S. citizenship and adjust the status of eligible evacuees to provide them with lawful permanent resident status after vetting and screening procedures."}

Many began pitching tents as the anniversary approached, wary of having to flee their houses once again.\n\nWhen the earthquakes struck in the early hours of 6 February last year, people in Idlib said they thought the ground violently shaking meant airstrikes ordered by the government in Damascus. Now the rumble of airstrikes makes them fearful that another quake is happening.\n\nTremors, whether from an aftershock or airstrike, are enough to send six-year-old Jinan running fearfully into the tent where she now lives alongside her younger brother, Abdullah, their grandparents and 18 other orphans. The earthquakes changed Jinan and Abdullah\u2019s lives and their frightened faces, trapped between layers of rubble, came to symbolise Idlib\u2019s suffering when footage of their plight was widely circulated.\n\n\u201cWe can deal with bombings, but not another earthquake,\u201d said their uncle, Omar Rahal, who shot the video, offering a little gallows humour. \u201cThis is our reality.\u201d\n\nReconstruction has been slow in an enclave where Rahal and others complain about being forgotten by the world. As those in Idlib attempted to recover from deadly earthquakes that killed an estimated 8,000 people across Syria, more than half in the north-west, the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Damascus scaled up a deadly bombing campaign in the enclave.\n\nOne particularly vicious campaign of strikes early last September killed 45 people in Idlib and devastated multiple pieces of civilian infrastructure, adding to the destruction wrought by the quakes, which damaged thousands of schools, medical centres and homes.\n\nThe UN said late last year that the violence in northwestern Syria had returned to levels not seen for four years. Around 3.4 million people are now internally displaced after fleeing fighting, some of them for a second or even third time due to the earthquakes; 43,000 people forced to move by the earthquakes are yet to return home.\n\n\u201cMany families came here as they thought it was safer, but after they lost their home here, they decided to go back to their villages, as they simply had nowhere else to go,\u201d said Dalal Albesh, who runs the Zumoruda women\u2019s centre in the town of Salqeen in Idlib. The town welcomed many fleeing the bombardments before it was badly hit by the earthquakes.\n\n\u201cThey went back to their old homes and risk their lives to live near the frontlines,\u201d she said. \u201cA few of them who used to have lands with olive trees decided to deal with the risk of being near the frontlines, so they could at least have an income. If you go to the camps, there\u2019s very little to do there, and people have very few choices in this situation.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Omar Rahal with Jinan at the hospital Idlib, Syria. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nJinan and Abdullah are attempting to heal from their injuries, sustained when their family home crushed them, while living in a tent. Rahal is haunted by the experience of rushing to his cousin Mahmoud\u2019s house in the Idlib town of Al Haram after the earthquakes struck, only to hear Jinan\u2019s voice calling to him from under the rubble, begging him to rescue her and her brother. He could hear their mother, Sara, imploring him to save her children before she was crushed to death by the layer of concrete that had been their ceiling.\n\nRahal tunnelled through the rubble to speak to Jinan and Abdullah, promising that he would either get them out or die trying. He recorded a video of the trapped children for his colleagues in the local police force, to help them figure out how to bring the right equipment, but it soon reached millions of viewers online.\n\nHe eventually managed to pull both children from under the rubble of their home, their mother\u2019s limp arm outstretched towards the pair. Jinan\u2019s leg was impaled on a piece of metal, leaving her with deep nerve damage that has required seven surgeries and a course of physiotherapy. Rahal had to fight to find doctors willing to forgo amputating her leg.\n\nHer recovery, he said, has been made slower and harder in the tent; they face brutal heat during the summer and cold rains in winter. Jinan started school last September, limping to attend class with the other children.\n\nAbdullah suffered burns from battery acid, leaving deep wounds that still require surgery on his feet. Not yet two, he is still trying to understand what he lost.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s young, but you can see that when he looks at the burns and scars on his leg, these symbolise that overnight he lost most of his family,\u201d said Rahal. \u201cHe had a mother, father and five other sisters just a day before. In one night they lost it all.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen The Maram camp for internally displaced people in Syria\u2019s north-western Idlib province in March last year. Photograph: Omar Haj Kadour/AFP/Getty\n\nReconstruction efforts in Idlib are also deeply intertwined with diplomatic struggles over the lone crossing into the territory, with the UN now dependent on Damascus\u2019 authorisation to bring in vital aid. The UN has also warned that a drop in donations has jeopardised their ability to provide services in Idlib; its funding for northwest Syria is running at a third of its target amount.\n\nThen there are the rising prices for even the most basic goods. Rahal pointed to the food baskets containing items such as sugar and bread that used to come as part of the aid packages, where \u201cwe would receive enough for the whole house, but it\u2019s halved\u201d.\n\nOthers working in aid in the north-west said that local authorities, linked to the deeply conservative militant group Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham, an offshoot of the jihadist Nusra Front, keep a close watch on humanitarian organisations operating in Idlib, implicitly warning them against working on any issues that might challenge their authority.\n\nRahal mulled the feeling among his extended family as the anniversary of the earthquake approached, recalling how Jinan began to cry on seeing videos of her deceased sister and mother that her grandmother played on her phone recently.\n\n\u201cWe are all too aware of what we lived through and what happened, and the huge impact it had on our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully the kids will forget with time.\u201d"}

For Palestinian residents there, life all but stopped when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October.\n\nIsraeli security forces who control Muqtasen\u2019s area, and have a guard post across the street, imposed an immediate lockdown, that in effect constituted house arrest, even for children.\n\n\u201cFor the first month, we weren\u2019t allowed to leave the house at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we even started to open the small grille on the door [to look out], we could hear them cocking their guns.\u201d\n\nRubbish piled up in their courtyard because they were not allowed to open the door to put it out for collection.

Now they can go out every day, but an unofficial overnight curfew that starts at 7pm is still in place. Schools remain closed, along with most local shops. One barber who attempted to reopen was beaten.\n\nPalestinians living in the centre of Hebron are used to violence and a web of controls that dates back more than 20 years, including bans on walking down some streets that are open to Israelis. The current restrictions, however, are unprecedented, they say.\n\nOur life was difficult here, but never this difficult. Shaadi Muqtasen\n\n\u201cOur life was difficult here, but never this difficult,\u201d Muqtasen said. There was a curfew of sorts during the second intifada, when he remembers relatives sending food to their house through a human chain over the roofs of the tightly packed old quarter.\n\nThis time is undoubtedly worse, he said. \u201cThey are putting very tough conditions to make us leave, so they can have this for themselves. It\u2019s not about security.\u201d\n\nOther residents of \u201cH2\u201d, the part of Hebron controlled by Israeli forces \u2013 stationed there to protect about 800 Israeli settlers living among 34,000 Palestinians \u2013 say they have been confined to their homes, harassed and attacked since 7 October.\n\nUnharvested olives hang heavy on the terraces of ancient trees that ring the city and the ground is dotted with small, pale green irises, but the only people enjoying the scenery are a settler herding sheep and a group of Israeli soldiers on a tour.\n\nView image in fullscreen A Jewish settler grazes his sheep on private Palestinian land in the H2 area of Hebron. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian\n\n\u201cNow settlers are the masters here,\u201d said Issa Amro, a Hebron peace activist who was detained, beaten and tortured on 7 October. He no longer has a full range of movement in one hand and says doctors have told him the damage he sustained may be permanent. \u201cI am well known, and look what they did to me. The others are afraid.\u201d\n\nLike Palestinian neighbours and Israeli activists, Amro says settlers are exploiting Hamas\u2019 slaughter to try to consolidate their position, hoping to drive Palestinian civilians out of Hebron under the pretext of fighting terror.\n\n\u201cI was not beaten and tortured because I am a member of Hamas. They know my politics; they know I am not religious,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are using the tragedy, the blood of Israelis and Palestinians, to fulfil their dream of \u2018the river to the sea\u2019 [the Jordan to the Mediterranean] without Palestinians. What they are doing has no relation to security.\u201d\n\nNow settlers are the masters here. Peace activist Issa Amro\n\nHebron is the most important economic hub for the Palestinian Authority, the second largest city in the West Bank, and for deeply entwined religious and political reasons, a nexus of conflict.\n\nIt is dominated by a 2,000-year-old compound built by King Herod to mark caves that Jews, Christians and Muslims believe hold the remains of the patriarch Abraham and his family.\n\nSacred to all the Abrahamic religions , which take their collective name from the biblical figure enshrined there, it draws the devout and the fanatical, and has been the site of some of the worst intercommunal violence of the last century.\n\nView image in fullscreen Issa Amro says settlers are trying to exploit Hamas\u2019s 7 October atrocity to consolidate their position. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian\n\nIn 1929, Arab mobs murdered 67 Jews in Hebron, forcing others to flee. Sixty-five years later, the Jewish extremist Baruch Goldstein killed 29 Muslim worshippers in the mosque above the tombs.\n\nOne of Hamas\u2019s most important West Bank strongholds, it is also a crucible of Israel\u2019s far-right settler movement, which was launched there and now props up Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. His national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, lives in Hebron, and his first date with his wife was reportedly at Goldstein\u2019s tomb in a settlement there.\n\nHebron was partitioned under the Oslo Accords into H1, an area under Palestinian Authority control where the majority of Hebron\u2019s 230,000 residents live, and H2, under Israeli control.\n\nIt is here that systems of separation, which internal and external critics describe as de facto apartheid, are the most extreme and visible in the West Bank.\n\nThe military map of the town centre is a complicated web of colours. Red streets, where passage has been denied to Palestinians for more than 20 years, are \u201csterile\u201d. Palestinians can walk on orange streets, but not drive or undertake any commercial activity.\n\nThey are making the lives of Palestinians harder and harder to force them to leave. Peace activist Issa Amro\n\nThe Israeli military say these security controls are necessary for the protection of Israelis and Palestinians alike.\n\nSettlers are open about their desire to expand their foothold in Hebron. Critics say they were empowered by the state to pursue this agenda after 7 October when they effectively became the army, called up as reservists to Hebron-based military units after regular troops were sent to Gaza.\n\nThe government has also handed out military-grade weapons to civilians and the settlers\u2019 own security forces, who can be seen on the streets of Hebron in a mismatch of uniform, partial uniform or civilian clothes that make it impossible to identify their command structure.\n\nCommunities are now at the mercy of ill-defined armed groups that look and act more like paramilitary factions than tools of state power, said Nadav Weiman, deputy director at Breaking the Silence, an NGO that documents Israeli military abuses in occupied areas.\n\n\u201cSince 7 October, Palestinians don\u2019t know if they are dealing with settlers or the army. The settlers are the army, and the army is made up of settlers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are raiding homes, stopping cars, even stealing, in the army of the IDF.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen A general view of the Old City of Hebron with the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the middle. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian\n\n\u201cIf this were the Balkans in the 1990s, I would say they were paramilitaries. But they are the Israeli military. There used to be a facade of maintaining rule of law in Hebron. It was military law, but Palestinians could challenge it, appeal. What is happening now just feels like revenge.\u201d\n\nThe confusing mix was on display at the entrance to the Hebron settlement of Kiryat Arba, when three people with assault rifles manning a checkpoint verbally abused an Israeli human rights activist and two journalists.\n\nOne man was in civilian clothes, a woman wore the uniform of the settlement security force, and a second man was wearing part of a reservist uniform.\n\nTogether, this mixture of security forces has locked down Palestinians living in Israeli-controlled Hebron with violent intimidation rather than written orders.\n\n\u201cThere are no papers [to justify searches, detentions and closures]. That\u2019s why I say it is like a militia,\u201d Amro said. \u201cThey know what they are doing; they are making the lives of Palestinians harder and harder to force them to leave.\u201d\n\nIsraeli forces controlling parts of Hebron have not only confined Palestinian residents to their homes, but have also barred any other Palestinians from crossing checkpoints controlling access, locals say. That means no family visits to celebrate or grieve, no doctors or medical professionals, no tradespeople for repairs, and no teachers \u2013 though schools are closed anyway.\n\n\u201cOne woman miscarried on 14 October. From 5am to midday, no ambulance was allowed to come in and she was not allowed to leave,\u201d said Amro, who has strained his back carrying cooking gas and other supplies from the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe IDF said in a statement that Hebron was not under curfew. It said traffic restrictions were \u201cimposed in accordance with the situational assessment and operational considerations \u2026 and with the intention of reducing harm to [the population] as much as possible\u201d, that requests to pass through checkpoints were \u201cexamined according to the relevant criteria\u201d, and that it had not instructed schools to close.\n\nIt described the claims about the woman who miscarried as \u201cabsolutely baseless\u201d.\n\nIn four hours walking and driving around the centre of Hebron, the Guardian did not see a single Palestinian outside their home. The only people on its ghostly streets were soldiers and young boys on bikes, recognisable as settlers from their yarmulkes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen kids stuck in their homes this long,\u201d Amro said. \u201cNow there are no kids in the street. People are so intimidated.\u201d"}

Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe overall design differs only iteratively from predecessors, with a fully flat rather than curved screen and new titanium sides, similar to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which gives it a gripper finish and in theory makes it stronger and more durable. The screen has Corning\u2019s latest Gorilla Armor glass that is more scratch-resistant and much less reflective, significantly reducing glare which, combined with the super-bright screen, makes using it outdoors as easy as indoors even on the sunniest of days.\n\nThe S24 Ultra has the latest top-of-the-range chip from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, offering a 20% speed increase, 26% faster graphics and greater power efficiency on previous generations. It is a very fast phone that handles games, demanding apps and multitasking with aplomb, but the extended battery life is more noticeable in day-to-day use.\n\nView image in fullscreen The speaker in the bottom of the phone is loud but all-too-easily blocked by a finger when holding it in landscape. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe phone lasts up to 60 hours of general use when taking photos, browsing, messaging and using 5G for a couple of hours with the rest on wifi, making it one of the longest-lasting phones I\u2019ve tested. High-end gaming or more intensive tasks hit battery life \u2013 an hour of Diablo Immortal consumed 18% of the battery. But otherwise I only needed to charge it every third day.\n\nSpecifications\n\nMain screen: 6.8in QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X (500ppi) 120Hz\n\nProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3\n\nRAM: 12GB\n\nStorage: 256, 512GB or 1TB\n\nOperating system: One UI 6.1 based on Android 14\n\nCamera: 200MP + 12MP 0.6x + 10MP 3x + 50MP 5x; 12MP front-facing\n\nConnectivity: 5G, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.2, UWB and GNSS\n\nWater resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 mins)\n\nDimensions: 162.3 x 79 x 8.6mm\n\nWeight: 232g\n\nSustainability\n\nView image in fullscreen The phone contains various recycled materials, but the outside is made of titanium, which should help it survive drops. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nSamsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.\n\nThe phone is generally repairable. Screen repairs cost about \u00a3270, while the battery is replaceable by authorised service centres. Samsung also offers a self-repair programme.\n\nThe phone contains recycled aluminium, steel, cobalt, glass, plastic and rare earth elements. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for old devices. The company publishes annual sustainability reports but not impact assessments for individual products.\n\nS Pen, seven years of support and AI everywhere\n\nView image in fullscreen Samsung\u2019s AI tools can be turned on or off from a central settings page, and include (from left): writing style, webpage summarisation and generative edit for photos. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe S24 Ultra has Samsung\u2019s fan-favourite S Pen stylus that slides neatly into the bottom. It is excellent for quick scribbles, doodles or editing documents. The One UI 6.1 software, based on Android 14, is packed with customisation options and tools across the system and runs well. New for 2024 is the promise of software and security updates for seven years from release, bringing Samsung up to par with Apple\u2019s iPhone and Google\u2019s Pixel 8 with only Fairphone offering longer.\n\nThe flashiest additions are based on generative AI, only some of which are hits and many are simply catching up with the competition. The phone has the same cool AI wallpaper generator as the Pixel 8 Pro. The keyboard has various AI tools built in, including language translation, advanced grammar and spelling, plus the ability to rewrite your messages in various styles such as with a professional, polite or casual tone. It makes you sound a bit generic, but I can see it being useful for those who struggle to write appropriate emails to their boss.\n\nThe Samsung Notes app can summarise documents, but only those under 8,000 characters (about 1,500 words), which seems a miss. The Samsung Internet browser can also summarise articles, even very long ones, with at least superficially impressive results.\n\nThe voice recorder app can transcribe to text, but not in real time like Google\u2019s version. The phone app can do real-time voice translation, so you can attempt to hold a conversation across languages. It works well enough for more formal things such as making a reservation, but predictably struggles with more casual language and slang.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t trust any of these features wholeheartedly without thoroughly checking the output, but they are useful in a pinch.\n\nView image in fullscreen Google\u2019s \u2018circle to search\u2019 is an excellent example of a useful AI tool that improves an existing experience. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nGenerative Edit in the photo gallery app is Samsung\u2019s version of the Google Magic Editor on Pixel phones. It is able to resize, reframe, erase or move objects and other edits, using AI on a server to regenerate the image each time. It is excellent for quick tweaks that would require firing up Photoshop to do properly, but can also make a right mess of things. Any images edited with AI are watermarked with a little symbol in the bottom left corner so that people can tell it\u2019s not entirely authentic.\n\nOne unique feature is the ability to convert any video to slow motion, using AI to generate the additional frames with some pretty great results, as long as you don\u2019t look too hard for artefacts.\n\nLastly, Circle to Search is a new Google feature on the S24 and Google\u2019s Pixel 8 series. Hold the home button or gesture bar, circle what you\u2019re looking for on your screen with your finger or stylus and Google does the rest, showing you information about an actor, searching for a piece of clothing or the highlighted text. It is fast, efficient and quickly became second nature. Technically Google Lens has been able to do something similar, but never in this intuitive and rapid way.\n\nCamera\n\nView image in fullscreen Few phones can match the quality and capability of S24 Ultra\u2019s extended zoom cameras that meaningfully close the distance to objects. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThere are four cameras on the back of the phone and a good 12-megapixel selfie camera at the top of the screen. Four of the cameras are the same as the S23 Ultra, including the main 200MP camera, the 12MP ultrawide and 10MP 3x telephoto producing equally impressive results.\n\nNew for the S24 Ultra is a 50MP 5x telephoto camera, replacing the 10MP 10x from its predecessor, which can also perform an in-sensor zoom for 10x magnification. The 5x magnification adds yet another tool to the S24 Ultra\u2019s armoury, and in side-by-side comparison it\u2019s very difficult to tell the difference at 10x zoom to shots from its predecessor.\n\nAll in, the S24 Ultra has the most capable and adaptable camera system of any smartphone.\n\nPrice\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra costs from \u00a31,249 (\u20ac1,469/$1,299.99/A$2,199) with 256GB of storage.\n\nFor comparison, the Galaxy S24 costs \u00a3799, the S24+ costs \u00a3999, the Z Fold 5 costs \u00a31,749, the Google Pixel 8 Pro costs \u00a3999 and the iPhone 15 Pro Max costs \u00a31,199.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra is the Swiss army knife of phones. It is a monolithic slab of premium titanium and glass that can pretty much do everything.\n\nBetween the powerful software, the stylus, the top chip, long battery life, tremendous screen and the super adaptable camera that out zooms the competition, there\u2019s little the S24 can\u2019t manage. It can even become a full Android desktop computer plugged into a monitor and keyboard if you want. And with a full seven years of software support you can safely use the phone for longer.\n\nThe AI features are a bit hit-and-miss. Some are certainly useful, but none of them are a reason to buy this particular phone over a Pixel or others as Google\u2019s Circle to Search will come to other Androids soon. Note too that the small print states that all of them are free to use until at least the end of 2025, but some may come with an extra fee after that.\n\nIt may only be an iterative update on its predecessors and other phones may do certain bits better, but not many can do all that and more. But you do pay a very heavy price both in the wallet and size for the capability. The S24 Ultra is a huge phone and in a world filled with foldable devices, it looks increasingly boring regardless of its stellar performance.\n\nPros: fantastic screen, the most capable camera with 3x, 5x and 10x optical zoom, new AI tools, good software with seven years support, S Pen stylus, top performance, very long battery life, contains recycled materials. Cons: massive, heavy, extremely expensive, S Pen may be superfluous feature for many, AI features not a reason to buy."}

Unable to find any work after graduation, now, aged 23, he is supporting his family of eight from his homemade hydroponic greenhouse in a refugee camp in northern Jordan.\n\n\u201cPeople keep commenting on me being the pharmacist who sells onions,\u201d said Abu Saleh. \u201cBut I try not to let that bother me \u2013 it\u2019s a job.\u201d\n\nAbu Saleh grows his crops in water rather than soil. Inside his greenhouse, the air is humid as nutrient-rich water passes through rows of red lettuce, strawberries and thyme before returning to an irrigation tank.\n\nA resident of Jerash, the most impoverished of Jordan\u2019s 10 UN-registered camps for Palestinian refugees, Abu Saleh had few opportunities available.\n\nView image in fullscreen Idris Abu Saleh\u2019s rooftop greenhouse with its water-efficient vertical hydroponic growing system. Photograph: Sami Jarwan\n\n\u201cI cultivate roughly 70kg of onions and 20kg of red lettuce every 40 days,\u201d he says, walking through his neatly arranged 32 sq metre rooftop greenhouse. The income he makes \u2013 about \u00a3166 with each crop cycle \u2013 is enough to support his family.\n\nIt is important for us to rely on ourselves by securing our own job opportunities and producing our own crops Mohammad Syam\n\nLocally, Jerash camp is known as \u201cGaza camp\u201d: it is home to about 30,000 Palestinians whose roots are in Gaza but who fled to Jordan after the war with Israel in 1967.\n\nMost of the roughly 2.2 million Palestinian refugees living in Jordan have been naturalised and enjoy the same rights as other citizens but the Gazans who arrived in 1967, and their children, remain in limbo. They hold no national ID numbers, which means they often cannot find work, own property or receive any state benefits.\n\nAbu Saleh was an early beneficiary of Senara, a hydroponic farming company launched in 2020 by Mohammad Syam. Also a Jerash camp resident, Syam graduated with a nursing degree in 2009 but, like Abu Saleh, had no Jordanian ID. Years of job rejections were compounded by his father\u2019s death, which left him in financial hardship and with family responsibilities.\n\nSyam credits another Jerash camp resident with the idea for his company: \u201cAbu Abdullah was the inspiration behind Senara, as he grew his own food on his roof.\n\nView image in fullscreen Mohammad Syam with his plants. The refugee is co-founder of Senara, a company based near Jerash camp that trains people in building and using hydroponic systems. Photograph: Sami Jarwan\n\n\u201cI then watched hours of YouTube videos on hydroponics, and after a year of applying for grants, I eventually won grants from Unicef and Oxfam to launch the company,\u201d says the 35-year-old father of two.\n\nSince early 2022, Senara has taught 49 people to operate hydroponic gardens and 34 how to build the systems. There are now 164 rooftop greenhouses operating, mostly in crowded refugee camps, but some in ordinary neighbourhoods as well.\n\nOne big advantage of hydroponic farming is that it requires a fraction of the water that traditional agriculture needs.\n\nThe UN defines water scarcity as one person having 1,000 cubic metres a year, and below 500 cubic metres as \u201cabsolute scarcity\u201d. In Jordan, an individual\u2019s annual share is just 80 cubic metres, according to Omar Salameh, a Ministry of Water and Irrigation spokesperson.\n\nJordanians access water according to a carefully regulated schedule, sometimes once a week, and in rural areas this might only be every two weeks, says Salameh.\n\nDrought, rising temperatures and rapid evaporation is turning scarce arable land into desert, threatening Jordan\u2019s long-term food security.\n\nLast year\u2019s meagre rainfall further depleted Jordan\u2019s dams, while springs are running dry at an alarming rate. Rainfall has been about half of its long-term average in recent years.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Global Dispatch Free newsletter Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are at least a million Syrian refugees in Jordan.\n\nView image in fullscreen Abu Saleh and a young helper work on his lettuce crop. Photograph: Sami Jarwan\n\nFarmers have been increasingly abandoning their fields as extreme droughts cause yields to plummet. But hydroponic farming dramatically cuts irrigation costs, according to Ahmed Mayyas, an agricultural consultant.\n\nSalim Abu Obeid, 21, had been refused work because he had no official status before he started working with Syam in 2021. Now he looks after two plastic greenhouses where Senara displays its hydroponic systems and tests out different crops.\n\nEach morning, he rises early to check the water levels and adds fertilisers to rows of onions, lettuce, broccoli, strawberries and thyme.\n\nView image in fullscreen Mohammad Syam inspects his crops in his large hydroponic greenhouse \u2013 or polytunnel \u2013 alongside two of his students, Idris Abu Saleh, left, and Salim Abu Obeid. Photograph: Sami Jarwan\n\nNo crop rotation is required \u2013 the same plant can be grown continuously without any loss in yield. \u201cWith hydroponics, all I have to do is remove one seedling and replace it with another,\u201d says Abu Obeid, who looks after greenhouses with a total area of about 1,400 sq metres.\n\nThe problem with hydroponics, the growers say, is the high costs upfront \u2013 most components have to be imported. According to the water and irrigation ministry, a single system to grow cucumbers can cost 3,000 Jordanian dinars (\u00a33,500), a steep sum for farmers. That partly explains why the practice has not been adopted on a wider scale.\n\nBut the benefits are great. Besides requiring a fraction of the water that traditional agriculture uses, hydroponic cultivation also takes up less space, since crops are grown in vertical rows \u2013 highly convenient for a crammed refugee camp. And it grants another scarce commodity for refugees in Jordan: financial independence.\n\n\u201cIt is important for us to rely on ourselves by securing our own job opportunities and producing our own crops,\u201d says Syam.\n\nThis article was published in collaboration with Egab"}

Having retired the year before, at 60, from his job as the director of finance for a south London academy, Wallis was keen to spend his newfound free time travelling the world.\n\n\u201cAs a child, I only ever went to the same holiday camp on the Isle of Wight, so as I got older I wanted to explore,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve hiked to the Everest base camp, taken the Trans-Siberian Express and canoed across Scotland, but Ukraine really stuck with me. It has beautiful scenery, warm people and a real sense of hope throughout the country.\u201d\n\nFive months after his trip, Russia invaded and normal life in Ukraine was put on hold. Around the same time, Wallis was diagnosed with skin cancer; he spent most of 2022 undergoing immunotherapy treatment while watching the war unfold on the news. \u201cMy diagnosis made me appreciate life more and gave me a new drive to help others,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew that, as soon as my health got better, I wanted to return to Ukraine. It felt like I needed to make my retirement about giving back to others.\u201d\n\nBy February 2023, with his health improving, Wallis travelled to the Poland-Ukraine border to volunteer with the US charity All Hands and Hearts, helping to renovate a disused hospital so it could be used by refugee women and children. Despite having no construction knowledge other than basic home DIY, Wallis installed a communal kitchen and painted the rooms to make them more welcoming. \u201cIt was hard but happy work and we ended up expanding the capacity from 100 to 500,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was very moving to witness all these people who had been so suddenly uprooted arrive. Although what I was offering to them felt like very little, it was humbling to see that, cumulatively, it meant something.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Wallis in Ukraine last year.\n\nWallis returned home to London and in May 2023 he was given a positive cancer prognosis. He immediately began planning his next volunteering trip. In the meantime, he signed up to drive deliveries to food banks for the Felix Project. By October, Wallis had flown to Krakow, taken a train to the Polish border and crossed via another train into Ukraine. He was back in Lviv for the first time since the war had begun.\n\n\u201cMy February trip was to Poland, so there was no real danger from the war, but in Lviv you saw injured men back from the front, you heard the air raid sirens and you noticed how tired everyone was,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone knew someone fighting at the front. While they were all trying to get on as normal, you could feel that they were each fighting for their survival.\u201d\n\nIn Lviv, Wallis was stationed at a volunteer kitchen that sent ration packs to the frontline to give soldiers a taste of home. He put in 10-hour shifts peeling mountains of vegetables and in the evenings helped fix camouflage netting to buildings.\n\nWallis became friendly with other volunteers and local people. \u201cYou meet some real characters doing this work, like the Ukrainian woman I befriended on the overnight train to Kyiv,\u201d he says. \u201cShe told me how she had to abandon her home when the war started and how she was now working as a lawyer for the UN. We became friends and still keep in touch online.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Wallis at Dalyan dog rescue in south-west Turkey.\n\nWhen it was time to leave, in December, Wallis had become such a fixture of the kitchen that the local cooks gave him parting speeches and gifts. \u201cIt\u2019s given me a huge sense of purpose to be able to go out and help,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve done office jobs where you\u2019re removed from what\u2019s actually going on. When you do something like make a meal or help construct a building, the satisfaction in knowing it will benefit someone is immense.\u201d\n\nNow 64, Wallis plans to keep returning to Ukraine to contribute to the war effort as long as his health allows, as well as to pursue his other passion \u2013 animal welfare \u2013 by helping out in dog sanctuaries in the UK and beyond.\n\n\u201cEveryone should try their hand at volunteering, since you get back as much as you put in,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is what I will be doing for the rest of my life.\u201d"}

Gas, cynicism and an unspoken colonial past", "domain": "theguardian.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBggKMJeqezDfswk", "text": "Not so long ago, Giorgia Meloni was calling for naval blockades along the African coastline and regaling her millions of supporters with white-nationalist conspiracy theories. Now, just over a year into her mandate, Italy\u2019s far-right prime minister has radically sanitised her discourse. Last week, at a summit in Rome, Meloni declared that Europe\u2019s \u201cpaternalistic\u201d approach to Africa had failed. From now on, she promised, Italy would be pursuing a \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d cooperation \u201camong equals\u201d, free from the \u201cpredatory impositions\u201d of the past.\n\nAs a gesture towards this new approach, the government has pledged more than \u20ac5.5bn (\u00a34.7bn) to fund energy, education, healthcare and agriculture initiatives in Morocco, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Mozambique, Egypt, the Republic of the Congo and others. In exchange, Meloni hopes African nations will take measures to help stop irregular boat crossings in parts of the Mediterranean, which last year rose by approximately 50% on 2022.\n\nThe government labelled the summit \u201ca great success\u201d and \u201cthe most historic such meeting in 200 years\u201d. The reality, of course, is more fraught than such vainglorious PR suggests. After all, Meloni had already signed an agreement with the president of Tunisia, Kais Saied, last summer, requesting assistance for cracking down on people smugglers. Despite his assurances, boat departures from the country have so far continued to rise and the new plan contains no formal guarantees that could seem to alter the situation.\n\nNeither does the proposed investment look particularly beneficial for Africa. While Italy\u2019s commitment to funding schools and water purification facilities is welcome in principle, there\u2019s nothing to suggest a sustainable policy is suddenly on the table. On the contrary, when you consider that part of the promised \u20ac5.5bn was sliced off the budget that was supposed to be dedicated to climate resilience projects, that future payments will be limited to \u20ac2.8m a year until 2026 , and that European companies could ultimately profit from the scheme, the investment starts to look less like a historic policy shift than a hastily organised back-room deal.\n\nThe more one looks into the details of Meloni\u2019s \u201cMattei plan\u201d (named after Enrico Mattei, founder of the state oil company Eni), the clearer it becomes that her vision is not about co-creating new paradigms for intercontinental cooperation at all, but increasing the Italian government\u2019s influence over EU foreign policy.\n\nFor months, the PM has been courting the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in an effort to convince her that, despite her populist past, she is a safe and reliable pair of hands. From her staunch support for Nato to her withdrawal from China\u2019s belt and road initiative, Meloni has worked tirelessly to align Italy with EU allies on key strategic issues. This week\u2019s summit was another part of that charm offensive. By bringing 45 African leaders to Rome just ahead of the European elections, Meloni aimed to showcase Italy\u2019s ability to secure new agreements not only on migration but also on energy imports. Her message on this front was clear: as the continent scrambles to compensate for a shortfall in Russian gas, her government is perfectly positioned to help the bloc gain a competitive advantage over other powers in the region by setting up new deals with Algeria, Egypt and Libya.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this and thinking that such a resource-greedy conception of EU-Africa relations sits uneasily with the Italian government\u2019s newfound egalitarian rhetoric, well, you wouldn\u2019t be the only one. Moussa Faki, chair of the African Union Commission, offered some particularly strong reservations about Meloni\u2019s proposals, warning her about \u201cpromises that can\u2019t be kept\u201d and reminding her that Africans are not \u201cbeggars\u201d. NGOs and civil society groups have also voiced concerns about the top-down nature of the proposals, complaining that the Italians have so far made no effort to consult local governments and communities regarding the investments and that there are no guarantees in place to prevent the exploitation or theft of natural resources that has been a structural feature of past relationships.\n\nFor all the pomp and ceremony, and all the pretty words, the power dynamics latent in the Mattei plan are all too familiar. Italy is throwing Africa some pocket change and expecting the continent\u2019s governments to accept its proposals without fussing too much over the details. Does that sound like \u201ccooperation among equals\u201d to you? Of course not.\n\nThe fact remains that until Italy takes meaningful steps to decolonise its institutions, any talk of fair partnership is doomed to hypocrisy. And that effort needs to start closer to home. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, Italy committed horrific crimes in present-day Ethiopia, Eritrea, Libya and Somaliland, yet public knowledge of this history remains scant. Most are simply unaware of the facts. Some, including prominent politicians, actively celebrate those years of dominion.\n\nThis has a direct impact on politics today. Right now, thousands of Africans are working in slave-like conditions, picking fruit and vegetables in Italy for criminally low wages. Government after government has turned a blind eye to this situation, treating it as a natural state of affairs. Thousands more African-Italians are stuck in \u201ccitizenship limbo\u201d without full access to public services due to jus sanguinis (unlike the UK, the right to citizenship at birth is still unapproved in Italy). These people have been demanding a voice for decades, but their calls have repeatedly been ignored. It is simply not a priority for any political party.\n\nMeloni\u2019s presumption that colonialism can be solved with the click of a finger is a patronising and ultimately racist fantasy that negates the inequalities that persist in Italian society. As her government scrambles to sugar-coat its self-interested, extractivist policies abroad, it\u2019s as clear as ever that no real justice will be possible until Africans on both sides of the Mediterranean are empowered to dismantle systemic forms of oppression."}

Her work chronicled the social milieu of the areas she lived in and visited, notably Plymouth, and was both celebratory and provocative.\n\nView image in fullscreen Tom of Finland, Untitled 1962 (From the Athletic Model Guild \u2018The Tattooed Sailor\u2019 series). Photograph: 1962 Tom of Finland Foundation\n\nMeanwhile, Tom of Finland\u2019s pioneering depictions of homosexual machismo in his images of bikers, cowboys, labourers \u2013 as well as uniformed soldiers and sailors \u2013 broadly represented queer, leather and muscle communities.\n\n\u201cBoth artists commanded avid fanbases, and since Cook came to prominence in the mid-1970s, thousands of people have experienced her work through reproductions, prints, postcards and calendars,\u201d said Joe Scotland, director of Studio Voltaire.\n\n\u201cHowever, many of Cook\u2019s original paintings entered private collections during her lifetime, and have not been publicly exhibited since. There are now limited records of their whereabouts.\n\n\u201cWe would love to hear from anyone who has an original painting and is open to loaning work for the exhibition, particularly Cook\u2019s inimitable depictions of women \u2013 confident, defiant and joyous.\u201d\n\nOpening on 15 May, the exhibition, titled Beryl Cook/Tom of Finland, explores the artists\u2019 interconnected ideas surrounding gender, sexuality, taste and class. Both their works \u2013 Tom of Finland\u2019s drawings of gay men proudly revelling in their sexuality, and Cook\u2019s camp paintings of women commanding spaces \u2013 celebrated pleasure and denied shame.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Art Weekly Free weekly newsletter Your weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitions Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cook\u2019s compositions were widely reproduced in postcards, calendars and prints that brought her work into homes.\n\nSophie Howe, Cook\u2019s granddaughter, said: \u201cWhen Joe Scotland first suggested this exhibition, pairing Beryl Cook and Tom of Finland, we [the family of Beryl Cook] were unsure how the artists complemented each other, but we soon realised their works share so much in common.\n\n\u201cDuring Beryl\u2019s lifetime, her closest friends were members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and it was these friends who encouraged and supported her. She was chiefly interested in painting people socialising and enjoying themselves, and so was Tom. They both have a great sense of humour. Beryl would have been flattered and highly entertained at the prospect of this exhibition, and so are we.\u201d\n\nDurk Dehner, co-founder of the Tom of Finland Foundation, said: \u201cWhat would Beryl Cook and Tom of Finland say about them being paired in an exhibition? With big smiles, they would be delighted. The two artists both explored and indulged freely in their sensual exploration of bodies.\n\n\u201cAs Tom said, \u2018Cock size doesn\u2019t matter to me. I didn\u2019t start doing those gigantic cocks until the censors let the magazines publish full-frontal nudity. I had to come up with something you couldn\u2019t get in a photograph. So those big cocks are all for the other guys \u2026 I\u2019m an ass man myself.\u2019\u201d"}

Will the west really ignore it because they\u2019re \u2018not like us\u2019?", "domain": "theguardian.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBggKMJeqezDfswk", "text": "Sometimes a disaster is so large that it obscures its own details. Behind the number of dead and displaced in Gaza, for women and girls the conflict has been disproportionately grinding. In a \u201ccruel inversion\u201d of the history of this conflict, the head of UN Women told the Associated Press, women and children have borne the brunt of the war.\n\nThe details are unfathomable. There are about 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza and 40% of those pregnancies have been classed as high risk; 180 give birth daily. The healthcare infrastructure has been all but obliterated. According to the charity Care: \u201cThere is no doctor, midwife or nurse to support women during labour. There is no pain medication, anaesthesia or hygiene material when women give birth.\u201d Babies are born on the ground in the wilderness, umbilical cords cut with whatever sharp object there is to hand, and tins filled with hot water keep the newborn warm. C-sections, painful in the aftermath even when drugs are plentiful, are being performed without any anaesthesia at all, by surgeons who do not have any water to wash their hands, let alone sterilise them, and no antibiotics for any resulting infections. In some cases, according to Washington Post reporting, C-sections were performed on women postmortem.\n\nWhen mother and child prevail in these impossible circumstances, they are then faced with displacement and hunger while nursing painful tears, wounds and malnourished babies. Pregnant women have had to make the 20-mile journey from the north to the south in Gaza. They arrive in circumstances that Unicef says \u201cbreach famine thresholds\u201d, and which are particularly concerning when it comes to the fate of tens of thousands of pregnant and breastfeeding women, the majority of whom consume only one or two types of food. Mothers cannot access sufficient food and clean water to produce milk for their babies, and when formula is available in the camps of the displaced, finding the clean water to boil and mix with it is a daily challenge. In December, month-old babies born in the camps of the displaced had never been washed. \u201cSo many aspects of motherhood,\u201d said a CNN report in November, \u201conce routine, are now a matter of life or death.\u201d\n\nThose who make it to those painful unsupported births and the precariousness that follows are the lucky ones. Only weeks after the war started, there were reports of miscarriages and stillbirths having risen by 20%. With something like 85% of Gaza\u2019s population now displaced, and large numbers settling in camps, the true scale of the maternal mortality, infant mortality and pregnancy loss crisis is certainly larger than even aid and news organisation reports suggest. But what girls and women have to go through doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nView image in fullscreen Women at the site of an airstrike in Rafah, Gaza, 3 February 2024. Photograph: Ismael Mohamad/UPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nAt a 5 sq km tent encampment in Rafah, no aid is allowed to enter, starving the inhabitants of food, medical supplies, hygiene and sanitary products. Due to the lack of period products, those bleeding postpartum and from miscarriages, as well as women and girls who are menstruating, have to use parts of tent fabric, clothes and cutoff pieces of towels, increasing the risk of infection and toxic shock. There is one shower for every 2,000 people and one toilet for every 500.\n\nIt has been jarring to be in the slipstream of mainstream feminist discourse over the past few weeks, as all this unfolds. Surreal to watch it swirl around Barbie\u2019s ostensibly not sufficiently feminist Oscar nominations, which drew a contribution from Hillary Clinton herself, after she stated her objection to calls for a ceasefire. Some of this is just human nature \u2013 our own contexts and cultures dictate our immediate priorities. But there are other impulses, uncomfortable to contemplate but hard to ignore, that de-emphasise the particularly inhumane and urgent situation when it comes to Gaza\u2019s women and girls.\n\nPalestinian women are seen as not sharing the sort of values that are called upon to come to their rescue. The fact that Gaza voted for Hamas 18 years ago has been deployed to prove that there is collective responsibility for the group\u2019s actions on 7 October and that there are no innocents. In another impulse, the entire value system in Gaza is brought into question by raising features such as the lack of LGBTQ+ rights. In addition to reports of sexual violence during Hamas\u2019s attack, these are seen as factors that should void sympathy for those in Gaza and render them suspect and aligned with Hamas, with Israel as the party that shares liberal progressive values. A New York Times letter responding to some US Ivy League students\u2019 blaming of Israel for the Hamas attack captured this collapse. Didn\u2019t \u201cHamas\u2019s many followers at Harvard and Columbia,\u201d the letter asked, \u201crealise that Hamas brutally persecutes the LGBTQ community in Gaza, subjugates women, and tortures and summarily executes dissidents?\u201d The argument may as well simply say: they are not like us, and they started it.\n\nIt is an argument that is a race to the bottom of humanity, giving licence to smear a whole population with the crimes of its worst, and abdicate the responsibility to think critically and empathetically about cultures and politics shaped by years of occupation, crisis and siege. In the US, a voter on the news programme Face the Nation said she was concerned about her reproductive rights, but that it would be \u201chypocritical\u201d to use those concerns to justify voting for Joe Biden when he is supporting strikes and blockades on a population that have led to calamitous maternal experiences and outcomes. That sort of clarity feels like a lot to ask at the moment, among competing influences of parochialism, tribalism and propaganda. But the details coming out of Gaza are so graphic, so relentless, that now may be the time to think about what progressive values, feminist or otherwise, really mean if they stop at the threshold of what is familiar."}

After all, her post office branch in Gillingham, Kent, was recording huge and inexplicable shortfalls.\n\nYet, hours later, without a lawyer present and faced with the threat of jail for the disappearance of \u00a353,000 from her accounts, she was confessing to stealing it.\n\n\u201cI started talking rubbish,\u201d says Adedayo. \u201cAnything to fit in, because two or three years in prison is not going to happen, I said to myself, not with three young children, not in my life.\u201d\n\nAdedayo has lived in the shadow of that day for the last 20 years, and it shows.\n\nHer eyes glisten with tears. Leaning forward, she sighs deeply and looks down at her feet. \u201cThey just turned our lives upside down. I swear. They are bastards. I\u2019m telling you. They\u2019re rubbish. I\u2019m 60 in a few months \u2013 couple of months I\u2019ll be 60.\u201d\n\nAlthough Adedayo\u2019s conviction was quashed in 2021, the confession she says she was coerced into making means she has been denied the compensation awarded to others whose lives have been upended by the affair.\n\nWhen I went into this business, I went with: \u2018What could go wrong? It\u2019s the queen\u2019s logo\u2019\n\nAdedayo is the kind of person who greets new people with a hug and tries to insist on buying the tea. She frequently makes reference to her religious faith as she tries to make sense of the trauma inflicted on her and her family through her involvement in the Post Office Horizon scandal.\n\nAs a result of her conviction, she says she lost her homes and her business, her marriage foundered, she was left suicidal and has never worked since.\n\nAdedayo, who came to the UK from Nigeria as a teenager, has lost her faith in British fair play, after one of its most emblematic and trusted institutions made her life a living hell. The Post Office, as she saw it, was a trusted partner, so emblematic of British society that it carried the queen\u2019s logo; she did not want to go into business with individuals who could defraud her, or with people she may fall out with.\n\n\u201cI really trusted the Post Office,\u201d she remembers.\n\n\u201cWhen I went into this business, I went with: \u2018What could go wrong? It\u2019s the queen\u2019s logo. This definitely is the guarantee I needed.\u2019 But I didn\u2019t realise that they have no respect whatsoever for that logo. Whatever.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to go about telling you how disappointed I am with the whole mess.\u201d\n\n\u2018I knew something was wrong \u2026\u2019\n\nIt was in the spring of 1999 \u2013 and with high hopes \u2013 that Adedayo moved with her then husband and their three young children to take over the Rainham Road sub-post office in Gillingham.\n\nOperators run their branches on a self-employed basis under contracts with the Post Office. Adedayo saw it as an opportunity to take charge of her own future, with her own business that would give her the flexibility to earn while looking after her young family.\n\nIn the beginning, the accounting work was carried on paper. Discrepancies arose, but nothing that could not be easily reconciled \u2013 \u201ctops maybe \u00a33, \u00a35,\u201d says Adedayo.\n\nBut 1999 was also the year the Post Office began rolling out Horizon, a new counter-top sales and accounting software developed by Fujitsu. Horizon was supposed to automate processes previously done by hand, streamlining the work of the operators. But behind the scenes, Fujitsu already knew there were bugs in the system.\n\nDespite that, the software was installed at Rainham Road in 2000.\n\nAdedayo says problems began immediately. \u201cIt started throwing up \u2026 deficits of some sort, like shortages.\u201d\n\nAlongside her sub-post office branch, Adedayo ran a convenience store. She would make good any shortfalls by taking money from her shop and transferring it to her post office business. But these transfers soon began to take a toll on her bottom line.\n\n\u201cThis is my own money to take back to the cash and carry, [to pay] my paperboys \u2013 things like that. I have to pay them,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, \u2018OK, maybe [we made] mistakes.\u2019 And we kept talking about it, myself and my assistant. But I was getting really fed up of it when it started going up, and I thought: no, something is wrong.\n\n\u201cWe would call them \u2026 We were calling the network helpline like there is no tomorrow [telling them]: \u2018We\u2019re short.\u2019\u201d But, says Adedayo, each time she called the Post Office\u2019s helpline, staff would just tell her to approve the transactions \u2013 otherwise her branch would not be able to open the following day.\n\n\u201cHonestly, honestly, if they said to me jump, all I need to say is how high, because I trusted them so much,\u201d she says. It was a trust that was to prove disastrous. \u201c[They said:] \u2018Oh don\u2019t worry about it. You have to make it OK. Maybe next week you will get an error notice come through. You will have a transaction error.\u2019\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Teju Adedayo: \u2018I didn\u2019t know there were so many of us.\u2019 Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian\n\nBut error notices did not come, Horizon owned up to no transaction errors, and the shortfalls grew.\n\nBy September 2005, Adedayo\u2019s shortfalls had grown to \u00a341,000. No longer able to cover them with the turnover from her shop, she began the process of remortgaging her home to find the cash.\n\nShe hoped her constant reporting to the Post Office would prompt it to come to help her resolve the errors. Its auditors came on 5 September. She had been out taking her children to school and when she returned, she says, she found her assistant kicked out of the sub-post office. And to begin with, Adedayo wasn\u2019t allowed in either.\n\n\u201cI noticed a lot of our books, how we set our things, are not there \u2013 so they\u2019ve packed up and they\u2019ve sent some of the things out before I got there. I got there like, I must say, maybe about 8.30am or so \u2026 and they\u2019ve already removed [things], before I\u2019ve even got there.\u201d\n\nAdedayo was told her branch had a shortfall of more than \u00a350,000 \u2013 \u00a310,000 more than she had reported back to the Post Office via Horizon the previous week.\n\nA row ensued. \u201cI said to them: \u2018Is this peculiar to me?\u2019 They said, \u2018Yeah, have you heard it anywhere else?\u2019 I said, \u2018No.\u2019 And it\u2019s true.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only now, in the inquiry \u2026\u201d\n\nWary of the impact of the highly visible row on her customers, Adedayo agreed to the investigators\u2019 request to continue the conversation upstairs. \u201cI wish I had not said that,\u201d she says now. \u201cI wish I had said we can stay right down there, in all honesty.\u201d\n\nAdedayo says that it was while they were upstairs, in the flat above her shop, that the Post Office\u2019s investigators threatened her with prison. She says they told her that if she admitted taking the money, and agreed to pay it back, everything would go away.\n\nBut, she says, they demanded she come up with an explanation of where the money went: \u201cOh, you have to come up with how the money was missing. Where is the money? What have you done with it?\u201d\n\nA transcript of Adedayo\u2019s conversation with the Post Office investigators, disclosed to the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, records what she told them. It took place without a lawyer present.\n\nIn it, she says she took \u00a350,000 to pay off friends or family \u2013 it is not clear which \u2013 who loaned her the money to start her business, on the basis she would repay it when she had the funds.\n\nAdedayo describes how, under pressure from investigators, she came up with this story on the spur of the moment. \u201cIn my head I said to myself, I need to have a story, because if I don\u2019t come up with a story they\u2019re going to take me in the police car, and the kids will watch, because by the time they get back, by the time they get the police on me, they\u2019ll see me handcuffed. I didn\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Adedayo appeared at Maidstone magistrates court, where she pleaded guilty to false accounting.\n\n\u201cBefore we went in I remember saying to my barrister at the time, \u2018I don\u2019t want to plead guilty,\u2019\u201d says Adedayo. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018You better plead guilty \u2026 because if you don\u2019t it will go really bad for you. The Post Office will make sure you go to prison, and that is what we are avoiding here.\u201d\n\nHer case was transferred to Maidstone crown court for sentencing and she was given 50 weeks, suspended for two years, 12 months\u2019 probation, and ordered to complete 200 hours\u2019 community service.\n\n\u2018I was ashamed to the core\u2019\n\nThe conviction destroyed Adedayo\u2019s life. \u201cThey thought I was a criminal in the society,\u201d she says. Vandals spray painted \u201cthief\u201d across the door of her shop.\n\nShe suffered a mental health collapse, unable to face the world, unable to talk to her husband, unable even to show her face at the school gates to collect her children.\n\nWith customers staying away, what remained of Adedayo\u2019s convenience store business failed after about a year, but her criminal conviction made it impossible for her to find work. She fell into debt and her home, which had been remortgaged to repay the \u00a352,864.08 the Post Office claimed she had taken, was repossessed.\n\n\u201cI was ashamed, ashamed, ashamed. Ashamed to the core,\u201d she says. \u201cMy dad had a heart attack, shortly after all this happened. And the reason was his bubbly daughter was no longer bubbly. I didn\u2019t want to leave the house.\n\n\u201cOn the day it was on the front page of the local paper, we were getting ready for school, and I went to go and get the papers in. I just shut the shutters. I told the kids to go back to bed \u2026 The thing is \u2013 ugh \u2013 you\u2019re a thief. The Post Office has that logo; [it is the] queen against you.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Because of her guilty plea, the Post Office has so far refused proper compensation for Adedayo. Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Reuters\n\nAdedayo thought she was the only one. It took almost a decade to realise she was not.\n\nIn 2015, a leaked report by Second Sight, a firm of forensic accountants the Post Office hired to investigate Horizon, and then fired, revealed the software\u2019s objective of producing a clear transactional audit trail allowing easy investigation of any errors \u201chad not always been achieved\u201d. It was around this time Adedayo first saw news reports indicating the injustices Horizon had caused.\n\n\u201cI remember saying to my daughter: please read this article,\u201d she says. \u201cSo she read it, and she said: \u2018Oh my God, Mum. This sounds like your story.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdedayo contacted Alan Bates, the former post office operator who founded the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance, and whose campaign was dramatised by ITV, and attended a meeting of others who had been affected by Horizon. \u201cThis is when I knew, it was not just me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I was hiding, and I nearly wanted to kill myself. I was saying to God, you know you have to take me because the shame will come off the kids, you know.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t know there were so many of us.\u201d\n\nBut Adedayo\u2019s path to justice was not smooth. Because of her conviction, she was deemed ineligible to join the group litigation order that led the way to the 2019 ruling that blew the scandal wide open. She says it was Bates who advised her to contact the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which eventually took up her case.\n\nOn 14 May 2021, Adedayo\u2019s conviction was quashed at Southwark crown court, alongside that of Parmod Kalia, who was jailed for six months in 2002.\n\nThey became the 46th and 47th operators cleared of convictions secured by evidence from Horizon, after the Post Office declined to retry their cases. But even then, their struggle was not over. Because both had made confessions and pleaded guilty, the Post Office maintained there was enough non-Horizon evidence to indicate a crime had taken place and has so far refused them proper compensation. Adedayo has received a small sum but intends to fight for more.\n\nShe now believes her race played a role in the way she was treated by the Post Office. Last year a document unearthed via a freedom of information request revealed the company used a racist slur to categorise black workers under investigation.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw that I thought to myself, \u2018These are the people I went to work with, these rubbish people.\u2019 I was absolutely livid, because I thought \u2026 \u2018I spent all my savings to come to you, knowing you think I\u2019m a negroid.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdedayo\u2019s hope is that she can now move on with her life. \u201cI would really like to go back to do something I\u2019m passionate about,\u201d she says. \u201cI would like to have the opportunity to put my life back on track.\u201d"}

When I first came I was a pre-med student in uni and I thought: \u2018After my time in the show I will go back home and pick up [my studies].\u2019\u201d It was a visit to church, during Miss Saigon\u2019s run, where the priest spoke about \u201cgifts\u201d that she realised: \u201cNo, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\nI was a pre-med at uni when Miss Saigon began. I thought, after my time in the show I\u2019ll go back home and pick up my studies\n\nSalonga was comfortable performing from a young age. \u201cIt always felt safe,\u201d she says of the stage. \u201cIt never felt like a space to be afraid of. Even if I was going through some sort of personal issue, being on stage, inhabiting another character for a couple of hours always felt like relief.\u201d She made her professional debut in The King and I, aged seven, recorded her first album at 10 and, in 1988, aged 17, opened for Stevie Wonder. That same year, she was sent by the singers\u2019 union to meet Mackintosh. \u201cCameron asked me: \u2018What size audiences have you performed for?\u2019 I was like: \u2018Well, I just opened for 10,000 people.\u2019 They wanted to find out if I was intimidated at the prospect of 2,500. I\u2019d answered their question.\u201d\n\nBeing cast as Kim \u2013 the lead in the story of cross-cultural love during the Vietnam war \u2013 in the West End, then on Broadway, was a huge moment for representation in theatre. However, the show faced accusations of racism that, despite its success, have never truly gone away. Bad press initially centred around the casting of white English actor Jonathan Pryce, who wore facial prosthetics and makeup to alter his skin tone, in order to pass as the show\u2019s half-Vietnamese villain. Then, on its transfer to Broadway, the US Actors\u2019 Equity Association bid to stop Salonga reprising her role, preferring to prioritise Asian-American performers. Mackintosh claimed he could not find a satisfactory replacement but it required an arbitrator ruling against the union before Salonga was allowed to keep the part.\n\nShe repaid Mackintosh\u2019s loyalty with a Tony for best actress in a musical and their partnership continued when he chose her to play \u00c9ponine two years later, re-establishing a role that, in the West End, is still played by women of colour.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think either of us were aware of how powerful, how far-reaching, that decision would be. That was not until much later where I heard other young women saying: \u2018Me, looking like you, made me realise I could do what you\u2019re doing\u2019. So if that became one of those touchstone moments that helped to move the needle forward then I\u2019m glad to have been even a little part of it. I have a pay it forward attitude of: \u2018OK I\u2019ve done it, whose gonna run with it next?\u2019\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen On to the next stage \u2026 Salonga and Simon Bowman in Miss Saigon in 1989. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nWhen Disney called, inviting her to sing as Jasmine, Disney\u2019s first princess of colour, in Aladdin in 1992, then the Chinese warrior Mulan in 1998, she pushed the needle on again. While these women did not share Salonga\u2019s Filipina descent, that they were Asian at all was emblematic of a shifting landscape in the entertainment industry. Salonga is proud of their legacy: \u201cWhen you see little girls of every race, colour and creed dress up as Mulan or Jasmine for Halloween it\u2019s like: \u2018Oh my God\u2019. It hits you that those two minutes of singing in this movie had some sort of lasting impact and influence.\u201d\n\nI still pinch myself I was on the producing team of a Broadway show with an entire cast of folks of Filipino descent\n\nA Whole New World won an Oscar \u2013 Salonga performed at the ceremony \u2013 and a Golden Globe, but if she could choose only one, would it be Jasmine or Mulan? \u201cMulan. It\u2019s the one where I look at the screen and say: \u2018She looks like me, I look like her.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is Disney that most people know her for. \u201cIt\u2019s just so far-reaching compared with musical theatre,\u201d she says. But her stage performances touch almost every musical in the canon; she has been a judge on the reality show The Voice of the Philippines and, last summer, co-produced and, for five weeks starred in, Here Lies Love, the dance-pop Imelda Marcos musical created by David Byrne and Fatboy Slim, with an all-Filipino cast. \u201cI still pinch myself that I was on the producing team. When I was cast in Miss Saigon I never thought I would see that in my lifetime \u2013 an entire cast of a Broadway show made up of folks of Filipino descent.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Salonga and her child, Nic \u2013 who shares their mother\u2019s musical talent \u2013 moved to New York, a decision driven by a desire to help \u201cmake this life less crazy\u201d for her child. \u201cI am raising a queer 17-year-old and it\u2019s not the easiest thing because they\u2019re trying to navigate what this means, so I try to open up my own understanding,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted them to be in a place you can navigate as a human being and figure out where you can fit in without always feeling there is this monkey on your back.\u201d\n\nIt is these sorts of personal experiences that steer Salonga to choose what she platforms online, spotlighting queer causes, anti-Asian racism and domestic abuse to 1 million Instagram followers and 5 million on X.\n\nView image in fullscreen Granted an audience \u2026 Salonga meeting the then Prince Charles. Photograph: Lea Salonga\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had relatives who were abused by their husbands. I\u2019d hear my mother say: \u2018What happened to you?\u2019 and she\u2019d say, \u2018I collided with a fist\u2019. When you grow up and hear those stories \u2026 I feel the need to spotlight it.\n\n\u201cIn 2016 with [Trump\u2019s] election I felt so many people were given permission to hate others, especially people of a particular colour from a part of the world that includes me. I\u2019m lucky in that I never got anyone shouting slurs or spitting at me, but walking around New York City felt like an exercise in hyper-awareness. It\u2019s exhausting to get back into the safety of your apartment and feel like that was quite the ordeal, even if nothing happens to you.\u201d\n\nHer tour, which takes in eight venues including one night at Drury Lane, is \u201ca dream come true\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely have Sondheim, some pop music, Disney, Miss Saigon, especially here, but it might not be the ones I sang,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember doing the show and being envious of other people and their music. Now it\u2019s 30-plus years on, I can pick and choose.\u201d\n\nAfter three decades, the industry looks different, too: \u201cThere are more people of colour behind the scenes, where we need to be: directors, producers. In the upper echelons, I don\u2019t know how far we\u2019ve gotten because the positions of really great power are still occupied mostly by white folks. With producers like Clint Ramos [with whom she worked on Here Lies Love] and writers like Lin-Manuel Miranda; for him to also keep pushing needles in his own way and for all of these people of colour, people like Rita Morena who we bumped into, who was also pushing needles \u2026\u201d\n\nSalonga tails off into a story that Moreno relayed about the night she won the Oscar for best supporting actress for West Side Story, and her girlfriends, outside the awards venue, screaming \u201cshe did it!\u201d because they saw themselves in her.\n\nSurely the same was true of Kim, \u00c9ponine, Jasmine and Mulan? \u201cYes I think it was that: \u2018It\u2019s possible.\u2019\u201d\n\nLea Salonga: Stage, Screen & Everything in Between is touring 21 June to 1 July; tour starts Wolverhampton."}

The trip also comes as the Biden administration gradually shows some frustration with Israel, with sanctions imposed Thursday on extremist settlers, although the US has brushed aside international calls on Israel to end its military campaign. A ceasefire proposal under discussion \u2013 drafted during talks a week ago in Paris involving the CIA chief and Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials \u2013 would pause fighting for an initial six weeks as Hamas frees hostages seized on 7 October in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, according to a Hamas source.

For Palestinian residents there, life all but stopped when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. Israeli security forces who control Muqtasen\u2019s area, and have a guard post across the street, imposed an immediate lockdown, that in effect constituted house arrest, even for children. \u201cFor the first month, we weren\u2019t allowed to leave the house at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we even started to open the small grille on the door [to look out], we could hear them cocking their guns.\u201d Rubbish piled up in their courtyard because they were not allowed to open the door to put it out for collection. He was allowed out once in a month, for an hour, to get food for his family. With so little time, he just bought bags of wheat, \u201clike I was feeding animals\u201d. Restrictions then eased slightly, and residents were allowed to leave home three days a week. Now they can go out every day, but an unofficial overnight curfew that starts at 7pm is still in place. Schools remain closed, along with most local shops. One barber who attempted to reopen was beaten. Palestinians living in the centre of Hebron are used to violence and a web of controls that dates back more than 20 years, including bans on walking down some streets that are open to Israelis. The current restrictions, however, are unprecedented, they say.

It adds that \u201cAl-Amal and Kamal Nasser hospitals in the centre of the city of Khan Yunis\u201d remain besieged.

The news agency writes: Doctor Said Abdulrahman Maarouf was working at al-Ahli al-Arab hospital in Gaza City when it was surrounded by Israeli forces in December. He described having his hands cuffed, his legs shackled and his eyes masked for the nearly seven-week duration of his imprisonment.

Photograph: Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/Reuters He described having his hands cuffed, his legs shackled and his eyes masked for the nearly seven-week duration of his imprisonment. He said he was told to sleep in places that were covered with pebbles without a mattress, pillow or cover and with loud music blaring. The Israeli military said it treats detainees in accordance with international law and its protocols are to treat them with dignity. \u201cIncidents in which the guidelines were not followed will be looked into,\u201d it said in a statement. It has previously denied targeting or abusing civilians and accuses Hamas of using hospitals for military operations, which Hamas denies. \u201cThe torture was very severe in Israeli prison. I am a doctor. My weight was 87 kilograms. I lost, in 45 days, more than 25 kilograms. I lost my balance. I lost focus. I lost all feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever you describe the suffering and the insults in prison you can never know the reality unless you lived through it,\u201d he added. Maarouf said he has no idea where he was detained as he was blindfolded throughout his detention, and he was not sure if he was held inside or outside Gaza. He was dropped at the Kerem Shalom crossing and was picked up by the Red Cross. Maarouf\u2019s arrest was the last moment he had news of his family, and he still does not know if they survived the onslaught as Israeli forces advanced into Gaza City under an intense artillery barrage. Maarouf held back tears as he described his last phone conversation with his daughter as the Israeli soldiers called on loudspeakers for all doctors and medical staff to leave the hospital building. She had been in the family home in Gaza City, one of his five children who were all there with his wife and 15 to 20 other relatives. \u201cDad the bombing has reached us. What do we do?\u201d she said to him. He replied that if he told her to stay and they were killed, or if he told her to leave and they were killed it would be torture for him. \u201cIf you want to leave then leave. If you want to stay then stay. I\u2019m in the same trench with you and I\u2019m going now to the Israeli soldiers without knowing my fate,\u201d he remembered telling her. \u201cFrom that moment until today I have no information about my children or my wife,\u201d he said, crying.\n\n\n\n1h ago 01.53 EST The Israeli bank Bank Luemi has told the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA that it is blocking its bank account due to \u201ctangible suspicions it is transferring funds to terror groups in Gaza,\u201d the Israeli newspaper Haaretz is reporting. The move comes after Israel accused 12 of the agency\u2019s employees of having taken part in Hamas\u2019 7 October attack on Israel, after which major donors including the US and UK suspended funding to the body. Haaretz said the bank had also received information on unusual activity in UNRWA\u2019s account and had sent them multiple alerts. It was not possible to verify the report.\n\n\n\n1h ago 01.39 EST An update on the situation in Rafah, where the news agency AFP says 128 people \u2013 mostly women and children \u2013 were killed in Israeli strikes overnight to Monday citing figures from the Gaza health ministry. The Hamas government media office said Israeli bombardments had continued across the centre and southern end of coastal territory, including near hospitals. AFP writes: \u201cThe situation is indescribable,\u201d said Said Hamouda, a Palestinian who fled his home for the southern city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt. \u201cWhether you have a million dollars or a hundred you are in the same situation,\u201d Hamouda said. Over the weekend, Israel pressed further south towards the teeming border city, warning its ground forces could advance on Rafah as part of its campaign to eradicate Hamas. On Monday morning, sources told AFP they could hear artillery shelling in the areas of eastern Rafah and Khan Yunis, Gaza\u2019s main city. Israel says Khan Yunis is where militants prepared for the October 7 attack, and that high-ranking Hamas officials are hiding there.

The Qatar-based broadcaster said clashes had taken place between armed Palestinians and Israeli forces in the city of Tulkarem and reported fighting in al-Ain refugee camp in Nablus. Five men had been arrested in Tulkarem, three in the city of Ramallah and three in the town of Halhul, north of Hebron, it said. Israeli forces and settlers have killed 372 Palestinians, including 94 children, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 7 October, according to OCHA.

Photograph: Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty Images Tensions have been stoked in the West Bank since Hamas 7 October attack as Israel further tightens controls on the Palestinian population and increases military raids. Last week Israeli forces disguised as doctors and nurses summarily executed three Palestinian militants in a West Bank hospital, including one who had been partially paralysed in a previous Israeli attack, according to the hospital. Settlers have also been emboldened to carry out attacks on Palestinian and Bedouin villages, displacing more than a thousand people, according to OCHA. Imposing sanctions on four Israeli settlers last week, US President Joe Biden said settler violence had reached \u201cintolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region\u201d.\n\n\n\n2h ago 01.10 EST Defunding UNRWA 'disproportionate and dangerous', Borrell says Halting funds to UNRWA would be \u201cdisproportionate and dangerous\u201d, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief has warned, after Israeli accusations that 12 members of the Palestinian refugee agency\u2019s staff took part in Hamas\u2019 7 October attack on Israel. Immediately after the allegations were made a dozen countries including the US and Britain suspended funding to the agency, which has sacked the staff accused while others are missing in the conflict and one has been reported dead. In a blog post on Sunday Josep Borrell said \u201csuch a disproportionate response would be difficult to conceive elsewhere.\u201d He added: If some doctors in a European hospital were involved in criminal activities, there would be a thorough investigation and all appropriate actions would be taken. However, no government would ever stop funding the health service, as this would primarily punish the people who receive these services. The wrongdoing of individuals should never lead to the collective punishment of an entire population. While the allegations against the UNRWA staff were \u201cserious\u201d and should not go \u201cunpunished\u201d he argued that the agency was \u201ccentral to the entire aid operation inside Gaza\u201d and that no other UN agency \u201ccould manage operations without UNRWA\u2019s infrastructure, logistics and personnel\u201d. He pointed out that while some EU member states had paused their funding \u201cthe issue has been accompanied by misunderstandings and disinformation\u201d and that neither the EU Commission nor Germany or France had decided to end their contributions. UNRWA was established in 1949 following the war surrounding the founding of Israel, when 700,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes. It employs 30,000 Palestinians to serve the civic and humanitarian needs of 5.9 million descendants of those refugees \u2013 in the Gaza Strip, in the West Bank and in vast camps in neighbouring Arab countries. Borrell added: Should UNRWA cease or limit services, which may be the case as early as the end of February, it would significantly aggravate the ongoing dramatic humanitarian crisis. The lives of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, not only in Gaza, are at stake. View image in fullscreen Palestinian children queue for food in Deir al Balah, central Gaza, on Friday.

In its latest report on the conflict and citing data from Gaza\u2019s health ministry, OCHA said 234 Palestinians were killed over the weekend bringing the total death toll in Gaza since 7 October to 27,365. Thousands more people are thought to be buried under rubble and almost 67,000 have been wounded. The majority of those killed are women and children. The deadliest incidents over the weekend included at least 11 Palestinians killed in a strike on a residential building near An Najjar hospital, in eastern Rafah early Saturday, OCHA said. Another five Palestinians including one child were killed in an attack on another residential building in eastern Rafah on Saturday afternoon and a further four Palestinians were killed in another attack on a residential building in eastern Rafah in the early hours of Saturday. Thousands of Palestinians continue to flee to Rafah from Khan Younis, further north, where Israel is now concentrating its attacks. However last week defence minister Yoav Gallant said the military would now turn its focus to Rafah. The Israeli attacks will leave an already traumatised population struggling to find food, water, shelter and medical treatment in an even more desperate situation.

For weeks I could not name him; to reduce this feeling to a single word seemed impossible.\n\nAny birth feels something like magic, but to become a mother at this age has felt astonishing; a dove drawn from my sleeve, the ace of hearts pulled from behind my ear. But it has come, too, with a certain intricacy. Older motherhood is not the most straightforward experience, and it elicits reactions that may be variously amazed or appalled or at the very least complicated.\n\nAll through the long months of pregnancy and the early weeks of my son\u2019s life, I felt I stood under a cloud of suspicion, as if his arrival must be attributable to some act of sorcery or science. In my case, some of this is understandable \u2013 three years ago, I wrote about solo IVF after years of miscarriage \u2013 and so it was logical that many might conclude this was still my story; that I had persevered alone in the world of fertility treatment until I finally triumphed.\n\nWhen I have told people that in fact I conceived naturally, with my partner, their surprise has been palpable \u2013 after all, the odds of natural conception after the age of 45 are less than 5%. The implication has been that I have performed a feat of 11th-hour heroics; like Indiana Jones, rolling under the closing door to reclaim his hat at the very last moment.\n\n\u201cMenopause baby!\u201d some have supposed. And while there is much anecdotal evidence of women getting pregnant shortly before they stop ovulating, in this instance, I was not in or near perimenopause. I was quite simply pregnant.\n\nStill, there has been a sense that there is something about my pregnancy that I have had to explain. In conversation with midwives, consultants, friends, strangers, it has been hard not to reference my age first \u2013 to make a joke about my antiquity, to acknowledge the sheer improbability of the whole scenario before they do.\n\nIn many ways it has been a strange tributary in the conversation most women have throughout their lives: why you don\u2019t have children, why you do. Fertility is a part of a woman\u2019s life that exists beyond herself, that is forever subject to public speculation and interrogation. \u201cQuestions,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it, \u201cthat push you into the herd or nip at you for diverging from it.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Sarah Lee\n\nI do not seem to fit: I\u2019ve missed the mothering years of my peers, and now absconded from my child-free fellowship\n\nIt has been stranger still to cross from one side to the other, as if handed, like a baton, between the divergent and the herd. At this stage in my life, I do not seem to fit entirely in either; I have missed the mothering years of my peers, and now I have absconded from my child-free fellowship.\n\nAt the start of last year I was some way into a conversation with myself about motherhood. After two rounds of IVF I had decided not to pursue a third. I had considered adoption. I had thought about donor eggs. I had even been offered, through an act of profound generosity and chance, another couple\u2019s embryos.\n\nBut I was weary. I was aware of the joy that lay in the life I already had. I could not countenance further failure, another miscarriage, or the gruelling effects of more fertility treatment. I had nephews and godchildren, I had a life that was full and creative, that allowed for travel and spontaneity. \u201cI think I\u2019m done,\u201d I told one of my friends, in the early weeks of the year. A few days later, I discovered I was pregnant.\n\nI am wary of the false hope this kind of fertility story might give: woman gives up trying to have a baby, then duly falls pregnant \u2013 as if the very act of wanting something is the very thing that might prevent it. I do not want this to seem like a cautionary tale of female desire. Nor was there any great trick \u2013 I cannot attribute my pregnancy to a particular vitamin supplement, acupuncturist, health regime. I have no advice. It was luck, pure fluke.\n\nIt was also not without complexity. I was of course elated to be pregnant, but I had spent a good two years grieving the idea of motherhood and imagining a different kind of life for myself. Now I was doubling back, revisiting the hopes of my younger self.\n\nIt was a heavy pregnancy. Multiple miscarriages had imprinted upon me a kind of dread. And of course I was older now, the odds therefore greater that something would be awry with me or my baby: foetal abnormality, gestational diabetes. As the days passed, I did not wonder if something would go wrong, I simply wondered when.\n\n\u201cWhich fruit are we now?\u201d one of my friends would ask each week \u2013 for some reason, foetal growth is often measured in approximate likeness to fruit and vegetable size, poppy seed through to pumpkin, via blueberry, apple, leek. It was a jovial conversation, though beneath it ran trepidation. Only once we were beyond the size of a papaya did I buy anything for the baby: a small, rust-coloured rattle in the shape of a bear that I kept in its packaging. Unwrapping it somehow felt like tempting the gods.\n\nMy age, and the fact that the baby was small, meant that we were invited for extra hospital scans. I dreaded these appointments. Every ultrasound felt not so much an opportunity to see my growing child, but a chance to learn something catastrophic. One afternoon late in my pregnancy, I lay on the sonographer\u2019s bed and listened to a woman in the next room crying inconsolably. On the screen, my baby bucked and reared. I held my breath.\n\nI could not voice these fears to anyone. I was trying hard to be invincible. I worked, I travelled, I ran a festival stage at seven months pregnant, I continued attending hot yoga classes until the day before I gave birth. But at night, my head ran with strange dreams, of flights missed, vases shattered \u2013 dark, sour visions.\n\nThree years ago, when I wrote about IVF, repeated miscarriage and terrible relationships, I realised that in so doing I had made myself part of a distinct social set: sad, lost, childless. People greeted me with a head-tilt and a tone of almost unbearable sympathy.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018I feel privileged to meet motherhood at this age.\u2019 Photograph: Sarah Lee\n\nThis changed once I was pregnant. I felt a sudden rush of warmth from the world. I was no longer one of the sad ones, the career-focused, the selfish or the tragic. I was not exiled to the outskirts of the village. Instead I found myself welcomed back in, friendships rekindled, those I felt had dropped me once they became parents suddenly inviting me round for tea. I was, at last, one of them.\n\nMost of my close friends were delighted to learn of my imminent motherhood. Others admitted their concerns about how it might affect our relationship after so many years of my freewheeling; I would not be available to drop everything and go to a gig, to join them at the pub, to be available when they needed me the way I had been for many years.\n\nSometimes their doubts seeped into mine. In the early months of my pregnancy, remarks others had made to me over the years resurfaced: the friend who deemed me \u201ctoo independent to be a mother\u201d and thought that I would come to resent my child; the partner who, when I was pregnant with twins, told me that I \u201chad not created a life conducive to motherhood\u201d; the podiatrist who for some reason looked at my feet one day and told me I was \u201cnot maternal\u201d. I feared perhaps these people had seen me more clearly than I saw myself.\n\nI thought, too, of how others had greeted my failed IVF. \u201cNo man will be interested in you now you can\u2019t have children,\u201d one friend told me that summer. \u201cYou should think of your work as your babies,\u201d said another. And of course I thought often of how people have specific opinions about older mothers \u2013 how foolish it is, how self-indulgent, how embarrassed the child will be to have an ancient crone of a mother at the school gates (we might note that such concern is rarely applied to older fathers).\n\nFeeding my son at 4am, I think how years of deadlines and late-night gigs have prepared me rather well for this moment\n\nMany talked about how much harder motherhood is when you\u2019re older, how exhausted I would be. In fact this was such a common thread that I have been surprised by how much energy I have had; yes, the first few weeks of motherhood have been tiring, but not insurmountably; feeding my son at 4am, I have often thought how more than 20 years of deadlines, late-night gigs, festivals and overseas assignments have prepared me rather well for this moment. That in fact at this age I am a vastly better mother than I would\u2019ve been in my 20s or 30s. I have done more, seen more, spent time getting to know and to like myself. I have a strength now that I did not have when I was younger.\n\nThose I hesitated to tell about my pregnancy were the women who had chalked up similar experiences of miscarriage and failed fertility treatment, who had found themselves uncertain about motherhood or were adamant that it was not their path.\n\nI had become closer to these women in recent years. I loved the quality and tenor of our friendship. I felt they had taken me in at my lowest ebb, and shown me how wide the world still was, how life could be lived differently, that there was a power in the unconventional. Now I felt I had deserted them. \u201cI am still one of you,\u201d I wanted to tell them. \u201cI have not joined the other side.\u201d\n\nMy son was born shortly after 9am on a late October day. In the delivery room we were playing Bill Callahan\u2019s One Fine Morning, and when he was lifted from me, he rose into the air with the line: \u201cAnd the mountains bowed down, like a ballet of the heart.\u201d I could not speak. I could only look at his small face and exhale.\n\nThose who have become parents will often tell those who have not that you do not know love until you have a child. This is not true. \u201cPeople lock on to motherhood as a key to feminine identity in part from the belief that children are the best way to fulfil your capacity to love,\u201d Solnit wrote. \u201cBut there are so many things to love besides one\u2019s own offspring, so many things that need love, so much other work love has to do in the world.\u201d\n\nI think about this a lot. How much love there is within us. How the love that I have for my son is deep and expansive and wild, but also familiar. It is both as simple and as majestic as the new morning rising.\n\nI have always felt undeserving of love and looked away. Now, when my son looks at me with all the love in his tiny body, I hold his gaze\n\nThe stranger realisation for me has been in allowing myself to be loved. Love, to me, has always felt painfully exposing; when others have loved me, I have felt undeserving, and somehow looked away. Now, when my son looks at me with all the love in his tiny body, I hold his gaze.\n\nWith this has come a reassessment of the past few years. How much I had been looking away. How disconnected I had made myself. How perhaps it was not so much that friends had disappeared into parenthood, but that I had withdrawn from their orbit. That I was just terribly sad.\n\nA few years ago, not long after my last miscarriage, I took an early morning drive across the California desert to see an Ugo Rondinone sculpture named Seven Magic Mountains. It\u2019s a magnificent thing, a monument of boulder and DayGlo paint in the middle of pretty much nowhere. The only way I can explain the impulse to see it back then is that in one of the greyest times of my life I was seeking the resuscitation of colour.\n\nAs I drove, I listened to One Fine Morning. Over and over, again and again. It\u2019s the final track on Callahan\u2019s album Apocalypse, and its lyrics seem to consider all of the songs that came before it: songs of drovering and wilderness and riding for the feeling; of man and nature and shifting perception. \u201cIt\u2019s a release song,\u201d Callahan once told American Songwriter magazine. \u201cOne Fine Morning is the blossoming, it\u2019s when the seed finally sprouts and begins to overflow into the air.\u201d\n\nIf I were to describe motherhood, it would be something like this. A release, an apocalypse, an overflowing into the air. It has been for me, a beautiful kind of dismantling. And how privileged I feel to meet it at this age. To stand at the point where the divergent meets the herd and look both ways."}

As Cai Qin Chen darts between serving coffees and taking orders, she\u2019s heard her name called out more often in recent weeks than ever before.\n\n\u201cWe noticed it right away,\u201d said Chen, who with her husband, Xin Chen, has owned the small bar in the Poblenou neighbourhood for 16 years. \u201cPerhaps people aren\u2019t seeing us as foreigners any more, but rather people who are part of Spanish society.\u201d\n\nWhat likely set off the transformation is a small, hot-pink sign recently put up in the entryway of the bar. \u201cI\u2019m not \u2018the Chinese on the corner\u2019,\u201d it reads in bold white lettering. \u201cYou can call me Cai Qin or Jessi. Or a bar, restaurant, cafe or pub.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Bar Montserrat in the Poblenou neighbourhood of Barcelona. The pink sign is visible at the top of the left door. Photograph: Handout\n\nIt\u2019s a direct challenge to the custom, common across Spain, of referring to certain shops and restaurants by the national origin of the people who own them, such as \u201cthe Chinese\u201d.\n\nIt crops up across Europe: in France, the term l\u2019Arabe is often used to refer to corner shops run by people with Maghreb heritage while in Rome and beyond shops run by people originally from Bangladesh are sometimes referred to as il Bangla.\n\n\u00c1lex Porras and Laia S\u00e1nchez hoped to call this practice into question when they launched the campaign #TengoNombre, or I Have a Name.\n\nThe pair, who are studying advertising at the Brother Barcelona creative school, had been tasked with building a campaign to tackle social exclusion. As they wandered the city\u2019s streets, tossing around ideas as they ducked in and out of shops and bars helmed by people from around the world, they realised the issue they needed to address was right in front of them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve normalised this language,\u201d said Porras, 22. \u201cBut if you stop to think about it, it\u2019s a bit racist.\u201d\n\nAhead of their December deadline, they spoke with shopkeepers in Poblenou, convincing about 10 of them to put up signs, and set up an Instagram page where anyone interested in the campaign could download a sign to put up in their establishment.\n\nWeeks later they watched in amazement as their class project began to take on a life of its own. \u201cIt was shocking,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, 24. On social media, the number of people following the campaign rose from a few dozen to more than 8,000, and media requests began coming in from across the country.\n\nOne municipality near Barcelona contacted them to say they were interested in taking part in the campaign, while friends sent them photos of signs that had been spotted in businesses across the region. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really understand what was going on,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re just students.\u201d\n\nAs reaction poured in from across Spain and beyond, it was evident they had touched a nerve. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who say nice things and others who are just haters,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez.\n\nSome opposed what they were doing, while others accused them of having too much time on their hands. But many applauded them for offering people the chance to reclaim their names. \u201cIn the end we generated debate and that was what we wanted,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez.\n\nAmong those who have welcomed the debate is the federation that represents more than 350 business owners from the Chinese community in Spain. \u201cI grew up here and these are words that we\u2019ve always used, even myself as a Chinese person,\u201d said Johni Zhang of the Federation of Chinese Corporations in Spain. \u201cEven we didn\u2019t realise that this sort of language sets us apart from the rest of society.\u201d\n\nHe described it as a \u201cmicro-racism\u201d that differentiates between businesses owned by Spanish nationals and those whose roots trace to countries such as China or Pakistan. \u201cEvery foreigner that comes here, we want to integrate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also need help from the community here, they have to accept us. And I think this is a very good way to be accepted.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks Zhang has contacted restaurants and shops in the federation and encouraged his social media followers to put up their own signs. \u201cI know people in Galicia and in Madrid who are putting up these signs,\u201d he said, adding that the reaction among business owners had been \u201c100% positive\u201d.\n\nIn Barcelona, Malik, a shopkeeper, said he was thrilled to put up a sign with the name of one of his employees, Al\u00ed. \u201cIt\u2019s little things like this that can change the world,\u201d said Malik, who moved to the city from Pakistan five years ago.\n\n\u201cWe learned the language, we work here but they tell us that we don\u2019t integrate,\u201d he told El Diario. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad to be told that by people who don\u2019t even bother to learn our name.\u201d\n\nAt the nearby Bar Montserrat, the pink sign has continued to make waves. Last month Chen was interviewed on local TV about the campaign, to the surprise and delight of the bar\u2019s regulars.\n\n\u201cAt first all they talked about was us being on TV,\u201d said Chen. \u201cBut then they said they found the campaign really interesting and were really happy that we could weigh in with another point of view as migrants in Spain.\n\n\u201cAnd from that day on, they started using our name.\u201d"}

From 2044, it is expected to rise to 68.\n\nBut the research suggests that this is not enough, and that anyone born after April 1970 may have to work until they are 71 before claiming their pension.\n\nThis age limit may need to be set even higher, say experts, thanks to the high rate of workers exiting the workforce before they reach state pension age, predominantly due to preventable ill health.\n\nLes Mayhew, associate head of global research at the International Longevity Centre and author of the report State Pension Age and Demographic Change, said: \u201cIn the UK, state pension age would need to be 70 or 71 compared with 66 now, to maintain the status quo of the number of workers per state pensioner.\n\n\u201cBut if you bring preventable ill health into the equation, that would have to increase even more,\u201d added Mayhew, who is also professor of statistics at Bayes Business School and has advised the government on rises to the state pension age multiple times as a senior civil servant and in his current roles.\n\nBy age 70, only 50% of adults in England and Wales are now disability-free and able to work. A smaller working population and a large economically inactive population reduces the tax base to pay for pensions \u2013 and creates huge labour shortages, which creates its own problems.\n\nAccording to the Office for Budget Responsibility, pensioner benefits will cost the UK government \u00a3136bn in 2023-24, of which \u00a3124bn will be spent on state pensions.\n\nJonathan Cribb, associate director and head of retirement at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that while he did not disagree with a higher pension age, increasing it without addressing other cost-saving measures was not \u201crealistic or equitable\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt would disproportionately impact poorer individuals whose ill-health means they have shorter lives, and so who receive pensions for less time.\u201d\n\nWhile the ILC\u2019s solution is \u201cillustrative of the kind of pressure that an ageing population puts on the public finance\u201d, a rise in the retirement age to 71 was not a \u201crealistic policy option unless you have a real emergency\u201d, he added.\n\nCribb pointed out that while state pensions and pension benefits are estimated to increase by \u00a345bn by 2050, the pressure on public finance from health and social care is estimated to increase by \u00a3105bn in today\u2019s terms over the same period. \u201cThe real issue is actually around the NHS and social care,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Intergenerational Foundation, an independent thinktank, agreed that the pension age had to rise, but questioned on whose shoulders that cost should fall.\n\nYounger people, their research has found, do not have the financial assets that their parents and grandparents did. In 2010, those under 40 held \u00a37.53 of every \u00a3100 of wealth. By 2020, that had fallen to \u00a33.98. One-third of the UK\u2019s 14 million Gen-Xers are at high risk of retiring on insufficient income.\n\nAngus Hanton, co-founder of the thinktank, said pension age should be based on life expectancy and occupation. He also supports a wealth tax to fund and pay more towards people\u2019s retirement, and reducing income tax and national insurance.\n\n\u201cThe over-60s should finance their own extra retirement years since they have received such generous treatment from the state,\u201d he said. \u201cThe money raised can be used to invest in improving the health and prospects of younger generations so they are less of an economic burden as they age.\u201d\n\nAndrew Scott, co-author of the 100-Year Life, whose new book, The Longevity Imperative, will be published shortly, said there needs to be a greater focus on preventing ill health not just in old age but from early age through adulthood.\n\n\u201cIncreasing the state pension age would be a terrible policy \u2013 a really bad way of attempting to make people more productive,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Finch, assistant director at the Health Foundation, said increasing the state pension age without providing support for workers with health issues would worsen the situation by exacerbating existing health inequalities. \u201cThe government should provide more support for people already out of work due to health issues,\u201d he said. \u201cEmployers can help by adapting roles and maintaining contact with employees on sick leave.\u201d\n\nThe government said it would ensure that the state pension remained \u201ca sustainable and fair foundation of income for future generations\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson said: \u201cWe have committed \u00a370m in employment and skills support for the over-50s, which has seen an extra 54,000 over-50s added to company payrolls. Our \u00a32.5bn Back to Work plan is supporting people to stay fit and find work, in addition to \u00a314.1bn to improve health services to help people live longer, healthier lives.\u201d"}

Tonight, the first episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm\u2019s 12th and final season will air, kicking off a 10-week run that will apparently wrap up Larry David\u2019s revolutionary improvised sitcom with a definitive conclusion. For a show like Curb, which perpetually seems to be on the brink of killing Larry off entirely, that sounds terribly ominous. Just how definitive are we talking?\n\n\u201cI will say this: none of us die,\u201d assures Susie Essman over a video call from a hotel room in LA, where she is preparing for the season premiere. And she would know. Any show that has been around as long as Curb will always have a fluctuating cast. Some stars, such as Bob Einstein, died along the way. Others, such as Wanda Sykes, disappeared and never returned. Recent seasons have been bolstered by the likes of Vince Vaughn and Tracy Ullman. But Essman and Jeff Garlin have been there since the very start. As the Greenes \u2013 Garlin plays Larry David\u2019s manager, and Essman his explosively foul-mouthed wife \u2013 the pair are foundational pieces of the Curb puzzle. Aside from Larry David himself, there is no greater authority on the show.\n\nAs such, Essman and Garlin are used to fielding questions about Curb. And lately, one question has stood out above all others: is this really the end of Curb Your Enthusiasm? After all, we\u2019ve been here before. David apparently ends every season by stating that he doesn\u2019t want to make any more. After 2011\u2019s season he drifted off for six whole years to do other things \u2013 a film, a Broadway play \u2013 before returning. So is this definitely, really going to be the absolute end?\n\n\u201cPeople have overplayed this,\u201d argues Garlin. \u201cOn every advertisement, it says \u2018The Final Season\u2019. In all of Curb, Larry David has never walked up and said: \u2018Hey, we\u2019re done after this.\u2019 But guess what? He did this year. He said: \u2018I am not doing any more. We\u2019re done.\u2019\u201d So that\u2019s really it? \u201cI gotta tell you, say there was an offer to do a Curb movie, I think it\u2019s highly unlikely that I would appear. I know the ending of the show. I feel closure. I\u2019m grateful.\u201d\n\nBut nobody dies in the finale, so is there maybe even a tiny chance it could come back? \u201cOK, so feasibly, we could come back,\u201d Essman concedes. \u201cBut it feels wrapped up. It just feels done to me.\u201d Did you feel this way in 2011? \u201cNo!\u201d she replies. \u201cWhen Larry called me after season eight and told me it was over, I went into a deep depression. I mean, I went into a serious depression after that. It didn\u2019t feel done to me, and I was right. But this time Larry and I have spoken at length since the beginning of the season, so I knew it was the swan song. I\u2019ve been prepared for it to be over for about a year and a half now, so it\u2019s not a shock to me.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018I don\u2019t like television. Curb is the one exception of my career where it was joyous\u2019: Jeff Garlin with Susie Essman. Photograph: Hbo/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe actual events of the final season are shrouded in secrecy \u2013 Essman reveals that they\u2019re a week away from doing reshoots of the finale, so even she doesn\u2019t know the finer details of the show\u2019s conclusion \u2013 but on the basis of the first episode, it\u2019s business as usual. Social norms are breached, deliberately and accidentally. Restaurant etiquette is discussed at length. The act of butt dialling is given its own weighty subplot. Everyone\u2019s a quarter of a decade older than when the show started, but Curb remains firmly in its groove.\n\nFor now, though, this is a moment that\u2019s as much about looking back as it is about looking forwards. Despite David\u2019s pedigree as the co-creator of Seinfeld, Essman insists there was never any sense that Curb would become the beast it did. \u201cI was a day player for years,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI had no contract. After every season Larry would say: \u2018That\u2019s it, we\u2019re not doing another one,\u2019 so I never knew from year to year if we were coming back. In season two I was only in two episodes. I never knew if he was going to write me in, or if the show was even going to return. It was the most slapdash operation. We had no trailers, we had no dressing rooms. It was just really like: \u2018I got a barn, let\u2019s do a show\u2019 kind of a thing.\u201d\n\nFor all the closure Garlin and Essman say they feel about the finale, they\u2019re keen to point out just how special Curb Your Enthusiasm has been to them: \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other job that I would have so much creative input,\u201d says Essman. \u201cUsually as an actress you get a script, you learn the lines and you work with it. But with this show, I write all my own lines. Every piece of filth that comes out of my mouth, that\u2019s mine. I can\u2019t imagine anything that would be more creatively fulfilling as a performer than doing this kind of a show.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like television,\u201d echoes Garlin. \u201cCurb is the one exception of my career where it was joyous, and I look forward to it. But all these other shows that I did, I felt trapped. And it was a horrible feeling.\u201d\n\nKey to this is the way in which Curb was made, with David and his writers producing a detailed outline for each episode rather than writing a traditional script, which allows the performers to vamp away in individual scenes however they see fit. Back when it debuted, this loosey-goosey approach felt entirely revolutionary. But over the years, reams and reams of shows have tried to copy the Curb formula, to varying levels of success. The show has spawned so many imitators, in fact, that there\u2019s a very good argument to call Curb Your Enthusiasm the most influential comedy series of the century.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to mention any names,\u201d Garlin says. \u201cOf course, people go, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re copying you guys\u2019. But there are probably about a dozen shows. You know, I really love Jury Duty. Many people have tried to do Curb Your Enthusiasm exactly, and they failed miserably, but Jury Duty is the first improvised show since Curb starting where I can go, \u2018That is amazing.\u2019 It\u2019s taken the form to another level. That\u2019s the only one I can think of, in all these years.\u201d\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given the elegiac nature of the moment, Garlin and Essman have decided not to let go of Curb completely. As of last week, they are now the hosts of The History of Curb Your Enthusiasm, an official HBO companion podcast where they\u2019ll dissect a new episode each week, starting with the pilot.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to What's On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It\u2019s not just us, either. We\u2019ve had so many crew members that have been there from the beginning. And we\u2019ve all watched each other, married and divorced and children and grandchildren. We\u2019ve had 23 years of life together, so it\u2019s interesting going back and saying: \u2018Oh, remember? Remember that day?\u2019\u201d\n\nGarlin adds: \u201cWhat also is interesting, really terribly interesting, is the friendship between Susie and me. She\u2019s one of my best friends, meaning we disagree. I am very vulnerable with her, and she is not nice about it. I\u2019m an annoyance to her. But I think if you\u2019re a fan of Curb, you will fucking dig the podcast. I really believe that. Maybe I\u2019m wrong.\u201d\n\nThe recap podcast industry is especially strong at the moment. Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa got a book deal out of their Sopranos podcast; the official It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia podcast sold out the Royal Albert Hall last year. However, don\u2019t expect Garlin and Essman to hit the road any time soon. Despite the podcast only just launching, the pair have already recorded more than 50 episodes. That amounts to almost a full year before the hosts will even start responding to listener feedback.\n\nOn the plus side, however, it means we\u2019ll still have a new stream of Curb content for two and a half years after the show itself ends, complete with several high-profile guest stars, including the man himself. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Larry,\u201d Essman grins. \u201cMy favourite person in the world besides my husband.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019re wrapping up, Garlin says: \u201cI just want to really be clear that I\u2019m grateful that I have had the journey of Curb Your Enthusiasm. And I\u2019m grateful that we\u2019ve made so many people so happy. That\u2019s really like, for me, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s not about accolades. It\u2019s not about awards. It\u2019s not about recognition. It\u2019s just that we made a lot of people happy. And let me say, I am terribly sorry to everyone who loves this show that it\u2019s ending. But I\u2019m grateful. I\u2019m grateful that I had the experience.\u201d"}

The British director was on his bike at a stop sign in London, looking up directions, when the device was swiped from his hand. \u201cI just saw this youngster accelerating away,\u201d he recalls with an exasperated smile. \u201cI tried to give chase but I didn\u2019t get very far. He swerved into an estate and I never saw that phone again.\u201d\n\nSo when Amponsah was later approached by a producer to make a film about a moped gang, he wasn\u2019t too enthused. At the time, newspapers were filled with stories about a huge wave of moped robberies. Headlines, politicians and police took turns to castigate the faceless thugs terrorising the streets. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m not sure I want to do something about these criminals who are causing a lot of upset.\u2019 But I realised it was an opportunity to take a story about \u2018feral young scumbags\u2019 and try to find the humanity in one such character.\u201d\n\nThe result is Gassed Up, Amponsah\u2019s first feature film, which is about to hit screens. It tells the story of Ash, a young man in a moped gang who uses his earnings from petty thefts to support his younger sister and addict mother. But when his crew become embroiled with an Albanian crime family, Ash struggles with the moral complexities of his actions. The film stars Stephen Odubola, Taz Skylar and British Eurovision entrant Mae Muller in her debut acting role, and won the audience award for best feature at the BFI London film festival last autumn.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018The language of the unheard\u2019 \u2026 riots in The Hard Stop. Photograph: Metrodome\n\n\u201cI wanted to tell the story of a young person\u2019s descent into crime,\u201d Amponsah says over Zoom from a hotel room in San Diego, where he is holidaying, \u201cand how that eventually ends in some form of redemption.\u201d I tell him it\u2019s rare for victims of crime to empathise with their wrongdoers. He pauses, as if pondering this for the first time. He says, if anything, he learned an important lesson from his mugging, which was to be more aware of the dangers around him. His initial, angry reaction was superseded by his artistic curiosity about what drives people to behave the way they do.\n\n\u201cAsh is suffering from a lot of things, including youthful innocence. That\u2019s why he is \u2018gassed up\u2019, which is slang for someone who has delusions of grandeur. I was keen that the film wouldn\u2019t be just a thrill ride \u2013 it\u2019s also a journey into this young man\u2019s mind. What are his daydreams, his nightmares?\u201d\n\nAmponsah, 59, was born and raised in London. His father was an officer in the military in Ghana, his mother worked in banking in Britain. It was during his time at art college that he developed a love for film-making, particularly after discovering the work of Martin Scorsese. \u201cI first watched Mean Streets when I was about 19. I\u2019d watch it nightly, it was like a pacifier for me. That\u2019s when I started playing around with Super 8 cameras \u2013 because Mean Streets starts off with Super 8 footage, shot around an Italian neighbourhood that Scorsese grew up in. I thought, \u2018Maybe I could do something like that.\u2019\u201d Amponsah had talent, and a postgraduate film he made won him a scholarship to the prestigious National Film and Television School in Buckinghamshire.\n\nHe says it\u2019s also partly down to Scorsese that he is drawn to his subjects. Like the American director, he wants to peel away people\u2019s layers \u2013 no matter how seemingly nefarious \u2013 to find a common thread. He wants to break down perceptions about people, to identify the causes of their trauma and pain. That was the thinking behind The Hard Stop, his 2017 Bafta-nominated documentary about the riots that followed the fatal police shooting of Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old black man, in 2011. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound airy-fairy,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t choose to make The Hard Stop, The Hard Stop chose me.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018I don\u2019t want to sound airy-fairy\u2019 \u2026 George Amponsah. Photograph: John Phillips/Getty Images\n\nThe director was at a dinner party and got talking to a community leader from Broadwater Farm in Tottenham, London, the estate where Duggan had lived. Having witnessed parts of his city in flames, Amponsah expressed an interest in making a documentary. The woman, it transpired, knew two of Duggan\u2019s childhood friends, Marcus Knox-Hooke and Kurtis Henville, who were keen to \u201cshow the world who Mark Duggan really was\u201d.\n\nThe documentary, shot over three years, had intimate access to them, and railed against mainstream representations of Duggan. It also opened with a Martin Luther King quote: \u201cA riot is the language of the unheard.\u201d Why? \u201cWe wanted to give the people who allegedly started the riot in Tottenham a voice, because these were people who \u2013 arguably \u2013 had a genuine reason for it. The history of these incidents in Broadwater Farm goes back to the riot of 1985, which resulted from the death of Cynthia Jarrett while her house was being searched by police. That riot was absolutely tragic in its effects and led to a police officer losing his life. It felt like that situation reverberated in 2011 somewhat.\u201d\n\nBehind every expression of anger, Amponsah says, there is always an element of fear. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in. What\u2019s behind the anger of the people committing those crimes? What are they afraid of? Are they afraid they are the forgotten people of society, the have-nots, or the will-never-haves? And what are the fears of the victims of these criminals?\u201d The questions, which give an insight into Amponsah\u2019s tirelessly enquiring approach, keep coming. \u201cHow many generations back do we have to go to find the original hurt? How much is the fault of our parents? And what kind of parenting did they themselves have to make them disappear, or become alcoholics or drug addicts?\u201d\n\nThe pain the family is going through is palpable\n\nThose weeks after the death of Duggan marked the worst civil unrest in recent British history. Three years later, when an inquest concluded that police acted lawfully when they shot him, Amponsah \u2013 who had attended the inquest \u2013 was shocked. \u201cIt was quite affecting. I\u2019m just glad it didn\u2019t result in another riot. Nobody wanted to see even more damage. But of course, it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nHe cites the case of Chris Kaba, the unarmed 24-year-old who died from a gunshot in a police operation in London in 2022 (the officer has since been charged with murder). \u201cI\u2019ve met his family about potentially making a documentary and it just feels like deja vu,\u201d Amponsah says. \u201cOnce again, I\u2019m close to a family who had this happen to them. The pain they\u2019re going through is palpable.\u201d\n\nSince The Hard Stop was released, the world has witnessed the global rise of Black Lives Matter, after the police killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in the US. In the intervening years, states, museums, companies and even football teams have attempted to reckon with their histories of racism and discrimination. Does Amponsah believe that relations between police and the black community have improved?\n\n\u201cI think that BLM did create awareness and spark discussion,\u201d he says. \u201cThe widespread coverage and shocking brutality of Floyd\u2019s murder created a moment where it seemed as if most people were at least willing to talk about why these things happen, and why they seem to disproportionately happen to people of colour. At the same time, I think that the unconsciousness in a lot of us that leads to the type of behaviour we saw from police officer Derek Chauvin still exists.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Drawn to crime \u2026 Gassed Up. Photograph: Vertigo Releasing\n\nSo in essence, things have changed yet remain the same? Yes, he responds emphatically, explaining that life is one paradox after another. For example, as a black man who grew up in 1970s Britain, he recognises that the experiences of people of colour in the UK today are \u201csignificantly better\u201d than before. \u201cBut they\u2019re also somehow the same. I\u2019m proud to be British, but parts of Britain\u2019s history was the conquest and colonisation of my ancestors in west Africa.\u201d\n\nThese days, while Amponsah remains tuned in to what\u2019s happening, politically and in wider society, he no longer \u201cconsciously\u201d watches the news or reads the papers. \u201cIt stresses me out,\u201d he says. On his mind are issues that he believes everyone is probably thinking about: \u201cBritain\u2019s political and economic problems, the war in Gaza, the possible re-election of Donald Trump.\u201d But while he\u2019s been on holiday in California, he has tried to be more introspective. He\u2019s naturally an anxious person, he tells me, and it\u2019s not improving as he gets older.\n\n\u201cPersonally, at this stage in my life, it behoves me to take an inward journey. Not to look outward and think, \u2018This is happening here or there. What can I, George Amponsah, do to change that?\u2019 Because actually, I\u2019m trying to accept that there is really nothing, or very little, I can do about any of it. The only thing I can really change is what\u2019s going on inside me, to try to find some sort of peace within myself.\u201d\n\nThis is why he was so keen that Gassed Up should include scenes focusing on Ash\u2019s dreams and the messages his subconscious is trying to impart. I ask him what the moral of the story is, if it even has one. \u201cIn some ways it does,\u201d he says. \u201cThey say everyone deserves a second chance, but life is not like that. Sometimes, that youngster ends up wrapped around a lamp-post, or they go into the criminal justice system and their life is ruined. But sometimes, we are afforded a second chance. I think we can all look back at things we\u2019ve done, especially when we\u2019re much younger, and think, \u2018I\u2019m kind of lucky I got away with that.\u2019 Or you look at what happened to some of your peer group and think, \u2018There but for the grace of God go I.\u2019\u201d"}

She received a standing ovation. \u201cWhen I say that I\u2019m happy to be here, I really mean it from my heart,\u201d she said.\n\nCyrus won for record of the year and best pop solo performance for Flowers, her first-ever Grammy awards. \u201cI really hope this doesn\u2019t change anything as my life was beautiful yesterday,\u201d she said during her speech.

She performed a medley of her hits during the ceremony, paying tribute to the inspiration for Kill Bill with an action-packed sequence. \u201cI came really, really far and I can\u2019t believe this is happening,\u201d she said during an emotional speech for best R&B song. She then joked: \u201cI\u2019m not an attractive crier.\u201d\n\nBest new artist was awarded to Victoria Mon\u00e9t, who also took home best R&B album. \u201cI just wanna say to everyone who has a dream, I want you to look at this as an example,\u201d she said.\n\nKiller Mike, who won three Grammys including best rap album in the pre-televised portion of the night, was escorted out of the arena in handcuffs by LAPD officers. According to the Hollywood Reporter, it was for a misdemeanour charge from that evening with details still to be confirmed. \u201cThe only thing that limits your age is not being truthful about your age or what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mike said backstage before he was detained.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jay-Z with his daughter Blue Ivy Carter, accepting the Dr Dre global impact award.

In his speech, he called out the Grammys for a spotty history with Black artists. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, we want y\u2019all to get it right,\u201d he said. He then added: \u201cObviously it\u2019s subjective because it\u2019s music,\u201d but called out the recording academy on wife Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s behalf. \u201cI don\u2019t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has the most Grammys than everyone and never won album of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo even by your own metrics, that doesn\u2019t work. Think about that: the most Grammys. Never won album of the year. That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThe evening, taking place in Los Angeles, kicked off with a performance by Dua Lipa singing a medley as she was surrounded by semi-clad male dancers.

The 57-year-old pro-democracy blogger is an Australian citizen who was born in China. He was tried in a one-day, closed-door hearing in Beijing in May 2021, with a verdict not publicly disclosed.\n\nYang\u2019s family was shocked and devastated by the court\u2019s decision, with a spokesperson describing it as being at the \u201cextreme end of worst expectations\u201d.\n\nPenny Wong, Australia\u2019s foreign minister, said on Monday the government was \u201cappalled by this decision\u201d, and said it had called in the Chinese ambassador, Xiao Qian, to lodge Canberra\u2019s objection \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d.\n\nWong said the Australian government had advocated for Yang \u201cat every opportunity and at the highest levels\u201d.\n\n\u201cAustralia will not relent in our advocacy for justice for Dr Yang\u2019s interests and wellbeing,\u201d Wong said. \u201cAll Australians want to see Dr Yang reunited with his family.\u201d\n\nThe sentence revealed on Monday is formally described as a death sentence with a two-year reprieve. It is a relatively common ruling that allows death sentences to be commuted to 25 years, or life in prison after two years of good behaviour. China is believed to be the world\u2019s biggest user of the death penalty, but there is no publicly available data. China\u2019s court system is notoriously opaque, with conviction rates above 99.9% and very few cases overturned for wrongful convictions.\n\nAssociate Prof Chongyi Feng, Yang\u2019s PhD superviser in Australia and advocate for his case, said Yang\u2019s sentence would be converted to life in prison. He said his former student\u2019s sentence was an \u201coutrageous political persecution\u201d.\n\n\u201cDr Yang did not commit any crime of espionage. He is [being] punished by the Chinese government for his criticism of human rights abuses in China and his advocacy for universal values such as human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nWong told media there were still avenues of appeal, however Feng said Yang was already struggling with poor health. \u201cFive years of arbitrary detention and torture have taken a heavy toll on his health. He is now critically ill.\u201d\n\n00:02:03 Government \u2018appalled\u2019 by suspended death sentence for Australian academic, Penny Wong says \u2013 video\n\nFeng urged Australia to press for Yang\u2019s return to Australia immediately, potentially on medical parole, so he could access treatment.\n\nYang\u2019s detention in China has been a key point of friction between the Chinese and Australian governments. Last year another Australian, journalist Cheng Lei, was released after three years in jail also on national security charges. Her release was widely believed to be the result of Australian lobbying amid attempts by both governments to repair ties and reset the bilateral relationship, but efforts to secure Yang\u2019s release were proving more complicated, according to sources familiar with the cases.\n\nDespite Wong\u2019s condemnation of the verdict, the foreign minister played down its potential broader impact on the Australia-China relationship, by noting the decision was made \u201cwithin China\u2019s legal system\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have said stabilisation means we cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, and we engage in the national interest.\n\n\u201cClearly this is an occasion in which we disagree. However, Australia will continue to advocate for the interests of Dr Yang.\u201d\n\nIn November, Yang\u2019s sons wrote to the Anthony Albanese, ahead of the Australian prime minister\u2019s visit to China, pleading with him to negotiate their father\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cWe request that you do all in your power to save our father\u2019s life and return him immediately to family and freedom in Australia,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe know our father has done nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cThey subjected him to more than 300 interrogations, over 18 months, including six months of intense torture \u2026 they deprived him of sleep, strapped his wrists and ankles and pinned him to a chair for days at a time, until he couldn\u2019t walk.\n\n\u201cBut still there has been no confession \u2026 He is in jail because he represents truth, democracy, respectful exchange of rational ideas.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, said the sentence was \u201ca reminder of the risks that apply in doing business or engaging with China\u201d and encouraged the government to maintain the \u201cmaximum appropriate pressure\u201d on Beijing to secure Yang\u2019s release.\n\nHuman Rights Watch\u2019s Australia director, Daniela Gavshon, said Yang\u2019s sentence was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter years of arbitrary detention, allegations of torture, a closed and unfair trial without access to his own choice of lawyers \u2013 a sentence as severe as this is alarming,\u201d Gavshon said.\n\nThe organisation called on Canberra to form a \u201ccoalition\u201d with the governments of other people arbitrarily detained in China, to lobby for the rule of law to be complied with and for the release of those wrongfully detained."}

But as Deadline observed, her announcement of a new album follows her pattern of releasing a new album, then two re-records, followed by new music.\n\nSwift, who has been nominated for 52 Grammys over her career, won two this year, including her fourth album of the year win. She is the first artist to win album of the year four times, surpassing the three wins achieved by Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon.\n\nShe also holds the record for the most-nominated artist to never win song of the year, having landed her seventh nomination in the category for track Anti-Hero this year. She lost in the category to Billie Eilish, who won with What Was I Made For?\n\nSwift\u2019s astronomical success has seen her dominate music charts and topple longstanding records. In October 2022, she became the first artist ever to land all top 10 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart. She has won the most American Music awards in history \u2013 40 awards, followed by Michael Jackson with 26; and holds the record for the most-streamed album in a single day in Spotify history, for Midnights.\n\nShe is also the highest-earning female musician of the past decade. Her global Eras tour is likely to cross the $2bn revenue mark this year \u2013 which is more than twice as much as the previous highest-grossing tour, by Elton John."}

More than half of those eligible to vote are aged between 17 and 40, and about a third are under 30, making the youth demographic key to the outcome.\n\nThe incumbent president Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term.\n\nWho is running?\n\nPrabowo Subianto, 72, a former military general and incumbent defence minister, is now leading the polls. His supporters perceive him as a firm leader capable of bringing stability, and he has promised continuity of Jokowi\u2019s development plans.\n\nPrabowo\u2019s critics, however, point to allegations he was involved in the kidnapping and torture of pro-democracy activists in the late 1990s, and of rights abuses in Papua and East Timor. Prabowo denies any wrongdoing and has not been charged in a criminal court.\n\nDuring campaigning, Prabowo, who has long had a reputation for having a fierce temper, has tried to show a softer side, using humour and dancing on stage at rallies.\n\n\n\nThis is the third time Prabowo will run to be president. He lost against Jokowi in 2014 and 2019.\n\nThis time, Prabowo is running on a joint ticket with vice-presidential candidate Gibran Rakabuming Raka, Jokowi\u2019s eldest son. This could allow him to benefit from the outgoing president\u2019s political clout, but it has also raised concerns among some voters about dynasty building.\n\nView image in fullscreen Presidential candidate and Indonesia\u2019s defence minister Prabowo Subianto and vice-presidential candidate Gibran Rakabuming Raka. Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnies Baswedan, 54, is former academic and was previously Jakarta governor. Anies has been viewed as the antithesis of Jokowi. He is the only candidate not to pledge to continue Jokowi\u2019s project to move the capital city from overcrowded sinking Jakarta to Borneo, saying he believes there are other more urgent issues that require government attention, and that investment should be spread more equally between areas.\n\nAnies previously served as Jakarta governor \u2013 a position he won in 2017 after a divisive campaign in which he was accused of courting hardline Islamic groups, fuelling identity politics. He is now running alongside Muhaimin Iskandar, leader of the biggest Islamic party, which has strong ties with Indonesia\u2019s largest moderate Muslim organisation, Nahdlatul Ulama.\n\nGanjar Pranowo, 55, has had a long career in public service and is the former governor of Central Java. He is a member of the Indonesia Democratic party of Struggle (PDI-P) \u2013 the same party to which Jokowi has belonged as president. It had appeared Jokowi would support Ganjar\u2019s bid to become prime minister \u2013 though Jokowi\u2019s son Gibran was later announced as a running mate of Prabowo.\n\nGanjar has sought to portray himself as down-to-earth man of the people, as he tours the country to meet voters. He too has faced controversy in his role as provincial governor, including over a mine development in Central Java, which drew criticisms from villagers and activists.\n\nHe is running alongside coordinating security affairs minister Mahfud MD.\n\nHow is the winner decided?\n\nPresidential candidates must secure more than 50% of the vote in order to win. If no one achieves this, then a run-off election will be held between the top two candidates in June.\n\nWhat are the key issues?\n\nThe role of dynasties and the strength of the country\u2019s democracy have been the subject of debate. There is unease among civil society groups, and others, that Jokowi is trying to retain influence even after leaving office. His son Gibran was only able to run as vice-president after a court, headed by Jokowi\u2019s brother-in-law, tweaked eligibility criteria \u2013 a decision that provoked controversy.\n\nMore broadly, young voters make up more than half of the electorate this year, and candidates have been making a concerted effort to target them through social media campaigns. \u201cAll candidates are actively utilising social media platforms, notably TikTok and Instagram, which predominantly attract young voters. This scenario contrasts with past elections, where campaign strategies tended to be more conventional,\u201d said Aisah Putri Budiatri, a political researcher at the National Research and Innovation Agency.\n\nYoung people are concerned about welfare and employment, she said, but added that while candidates\u2019 policy platforms all mention these issues: \u201cThere\u2019s a noticeable absence of discussions on programs tailored specifically for the youth demographic, with candidates often resorting to political gimmicks in their attempts to engage this demographic.\u201d"}

That said, ultimately, it is no one else\u2019s business; the idea that it might be is surely half the problem.\n\nWe follow Bowler, 34, in his quest to find a loving partner while educating the world that disabled people like him want \u2013 and can have \u2013 sexual relationships. We see him in front of audiences working as a sex and disability educator, embarking on a long-distance relationship, and having conversations with his devoted, straight-talking mum \u2013 who is, in many ways, the star of the show. When she investigates the sex worker adverts Bowler is browsing on his laptop, her reaction could be a deleted scene from the Royle Family or Phoenix Nights. \u201cBi-curious?!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cOh, they want to try. Try before you buy, like.\u201d\n\nDiscussions of Bowler\u2019s experiences with sex workers \u2013 his mum paid for him to lose his virginity as a Christmas present, even going out to buy him condoms \u2013 make up a large portion of the programme. It is a questionable focus. It hardly represents the vast majority of disabled people\u2019s lives, nor does it do much to challenge the idea that disabled people aren\u2019t desirable. To her credit, Bowler\u2019s mum shows concern that paying for sex is \u201cexploitative\u201d of some women, but issues of exploitation are largely glossed over, other than a harrowing story in which Bowler recounts being financially and emotionally abused by a sex worker. Bowler is emphatic that sex workers should be available on the NHS for \u201cpeople like me\u201d and there are many interesting, complex dilemmas at play here worthy of discussion. Does society have a duty to help a person fulfil their sexual desires? What form might that take, ethically? If you and your partner are unable to have sex without physical support, what do you do? If disabled men\u2019s sexual desires are seen as needs, are disabled women\u2019s considered the same? None of these questions have easy answers, but this documentary would have been strengthened if it had at least asked them.\n\nThere are some odd directorial choices throughout. In one scene, we see Bowler helped by a personal assistant to change his clothing and put on deodorant. I can only applaud Bowler for his courage in being open, but I wonder what purpose such moments are supposed to serve. Would we see a non-disabled person undress ahead of their date? This feeling is only encouraged by lingering shots of Bowler\u2019s hoist, ventilator and wheelchair. There is a fine line between authentic and fetishistic. In contrast, there is little focus on the crucial societal factors that disable Bowler. At one point, we see him drink from a mug with a metre-long straw because he doesn\u2019t have the 24/7 care support he needs. These details are left regretfully unexplored.\n\nThe film is on better ground when Bowler speaks to other disabled people. We see him prepare a speech for a disability organisation in which he gives practical tips on how to enjoy sex if you are physically disabled. Most touchingly, we watch Bowler meet a woman he has been chatting to online. Samantha, from north Wales, who has a similar disability to Bowler, can clearly connect to him on a level few others can, but it is when the couple are shown to be like any other young daters that the fledgling romance feels most real. \u201cYou\u2019re shit at it,\u201d says Samantha about his lax communication skills.\n\nIronically, the most affecting relationships in the programme aren\u2019t romantic but familial. Bowler\u2019s brother, Geraint, who was also born with DMD, died in his 20s after having a heart attack. \u201cHe was the love of my life,\u201d Bowler admits. His mother describes that loss as a physical pain \u2013 \u201clike a knife down me\u201d \u2013 but knows, with her other son\u2019s life expectancy also affected by his disability, she will probably have to endure it again.\n\nIn the meantime, Bowler simply wants to live \u2013 with all the mess, joy and heartbreak that entails. The title of the programme may include \u201csex\u201d, but really, this is as much a story about love: that universal human urge for connection, to love somebody and to be loved in return. \u201cThere comes a time in everyone\u2019s life when you need someone else,\u201d Bowler reflects. \u201cI want to be happy again.\u201d The viewer will leave wishing nothing less for him.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to What's On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Almost all of the televised awards were won by women, including best pop solo performance and record of the year by Miley Cyrus, song of the year by Billie Eilish, best R&B song by SZA, best m\u00fasica urbana album by Karol G, best new artist by Victoria Mon\u00e9t and best country album by Lainey Wilson.

(Beyonc\u00e9 was there in support of Jay-Z\u2019s global icon award but said and gave nothing, as is her right.) Jay-Z made a point to note that Beyonc\u00e9 has somehow never won album of the year. Swift, meanwhile, is now the only artist to have won album of the year four times. The night\u2019s performance highlights included a first-ever Grammy performance by the 80-year-old Joni Mitchell, the first single in 17 years from Billy Joel and a moving duet of Fast Car by Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs.

Yet the rate of total syphilis cases across U.S. states and the District of Columbia \u2013 including all stages of the infection and congenital syphilis \u2013 rose by 17%, CDC figures show, with the total number of cases increasing 80% compared with 2018.\n\n[ READ: Congenital Syphilis Soars Amid \u2018Missed Opportunities\u2019 ]\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022, the rate of chlamydia cases held largely steady, and the rate of gonorrhea infections fell 9.2%. A drop in total gonorrhea cases was the first in at least a decade, according to a statement from Dr. Laura Bachmann, acting director of the CDC\u2019s Division of STD Prevention. But Bachmann said officials would examine whether it marked \u201ca true decline in infections\u201d or was tied to changes in diagnoses and reporting.\n\nThe continued growth in syphilis cases is of particular concern, especially in light of potential funding cuts that could hamper efforts to curb sexually transmitted diseases: The country\u2019s 207,255 cases marked its highest total since 1950, according to the CDC, while the rate of primary and secondary syphilis cases \u2013 when the disease is particularly contagious \u2013 rose by 9% from 2021 to 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, cases of congenital syphilis \u2013 which occurs when a mother passes a syphilis infection to her baby while pregnant and can result in the infant\u2019s death \u2013 surged by more than 30% year over year to 3,755, and the rate of 102.5 cases per 100,000 live births is the highest reported since 1991. There were 282 stillbirths and infant deaths related to congenital syphilis in 2022, and five states \u2013 Texas, California, Arizona, Florida and Louisiana \u2013 accounted for nearly 60% of congenital syphilis cases that year.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. syphilis epidemic worsened yet another year, and swift action is urgently needed to slow the curve,\u201d Bachmann said.\n\nBy race and ethnicity, CDC data shows the rate of chlamydia infections in 2022 was highest among Black individuals at 1,113.3 cases per 100,000, while Asians had the lowest rate at 100.6 per 100,000. Black individuals also had the highest rate of reported gonorrhea cases in 2022 at 585.9 infections per 100,000 people, while Asians had the lowest rate at 39.8 per 100,000. American Indian and Alaska Native people had the highest rate of primary and secondary syphilis cases in 2022, at 67 per 100,000. The rate of congenital syphilis also was highest in connection with American Indian and Alaska Native mothers in 2022, at 644.7 cases per 100,000 live births.\n\n[ READ: The U.S. Hasn\u2019t Seen Syphilis Cases This High Since 1950 ]\n\nNotably, public health efforts to mitigate sexually transmitted infections were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the CDC urges caution when interpreting trends from that time period, as factors such as \u201cchanges in access to sexual health care, as well as disruptions in public health services\u201d, can impact the number of cases reported. For example, the CDC says reduced screening and a focus on other infections may have impacted how many chlamydia cases were reported.\n\nThese are the states with the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases per 100,000 population in 2022, according to available figures from the CDC and based on cumulative cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis."}

But it doesn't address cruder clips \u2212 so-called \"cheap fakes \u2212 made with basic editing tools, nor does it address clips that show someone doing something they did not.\n\nThe Oversight Board upheld Meta's decision to allow the Biden video to remain on Facebook but called on Meta to crack down on all doctored content, regardless of how it was created or altered. It also recommended that Meta clearly define the aim of its policy to encompass election interference.\n\nOf particular concern is faked audio, which the board said is \u201cone of the most potent forms of electoral disinformation we\u2019re seeing around the world.\u201d\n\nIn January, a fake robocall used Biden's voice to encourage New Hampshire voters to skip the primary. The robocall was artificially generated and is being probed by the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office as an attempt at voter suppression. It had no effect on the outcome of the primary \u2013 Biden won in a landslide \u2013 but it illustrated how generative AI could be used to influence an election, critics say.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, the policy makes little sense,\u201d Oversight Board Co-Chair Michael McConnell said in a statement. \u201cIt bans altered videos that show people saying things they do not say, but does not prohibit posts depicting an individual doing something they did not do. It only applies to video created through AI, but lets other fake content off the hook.\u201d\n\nMeta did not say whether it would follow the Oversight Board\u2019s guidance. A spokesman said the company was reviewing the recommendations and would respond publicly within 60 days.\n\nEven if Meta makes changes to its manipulated media policy, observers say there's no guarantee it will put enough money and resources into enforcing the changes.\n\n\u201cThe volume of misleading content is rising, and the quality of tools to create it is rapidly increasing,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cPlatforms must keep pace with these changes, especially in light of global elections during which certain actors seek to mislead the public.\u201d\n\nIn the first AI election, 'a tsunami of disinformation'\n\nThe stakes are not just high in the United States. In 2024, more people will have a chance to vote than in any previous election, increasing the likelihood that AI will play a role at the ballot box. And that's raising concerns.\n\nWith rapid advances in technology and too little oversight from the government or private sector, election experts have been bracing for the malicious use of deepfakes in the 2024 presidential contest. Virtually anyone can now create or digitally alter images and clips in realistic ways to deceive voters.\n\nLike other technology companies, Meta has made pledges to curb the harms of generative AI. Yet, even as the technology grows more sophisticated, powerful and ubiquitous, there are still very few rules governing its use.\n\nIn the case of the doctored video, the original footage showed Biden accompanying his granddaughter for her first time voting in October 2022. Biden placed an \u201cI voted\u201d sticker near her neckline as she instructed then kissed her on the cheek. But the looped version made it seem as if Biden were repeatedly touching her chest. The caption labeled Biden a \u201csick pedophile.\u201d\n\nMeta left the video up, saying it did not violate its rules because it was not altered using AI and did not show Biden saying something he did not say. The company made a similar decision in 2019 over a clip that was slowed down to make then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appear drunk \u2212even as Democrats fumed.\n\nBiden\u2019s 2024 campaign has set up a deepfake task force to respond to misleading AI-generated falsehoods and propaganda.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be a tsunami of disinformation in 2024. We are already seeing it, and it is going to get much worse,\u201d said Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution. \u201cPeople are anticipating that this will be a close election, and anything that shifts 50,000 votes in three or four states could be decisive.\u201d\n\nHow Facebook and other social media platforms police faked content\n\nWhat\u2019s alarming to West is the tepid response from social media platforms that host this content.\n\nRather than strengthening protections, Meta and other major technology companies have loosened their misinformation policies and laid off staffers charged with policing lies and propaganda since the 2020 election, West said.\n\nMeta also now allows political ads to question the legitimacy of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. It does not allow ads that question the legitimacy of current or upcoming elections.\n\n\u201cSo at a time when fake videos are becoming rampant, their capacity to deal with it is quite limited,\u201d West said.\n\nWhen policing fake election content, social media platforms can take it down, slap warning labels on it or demote it.\n\nTo ensure the policy is \"proportionate,\" the Oversight Board recommended that Meta stop removing manipulated media when there is no other policy violation and instead apply a label warning the content has been significantly altered and may be misleading.\n\nIt also discouraged Meta from demoting content that fact-checkers identify as altered or fake without informing users or providing an appeals process.\n\n\u201cPolitical speech must be unwaveringly protected. This sometimes includes claims that are disputed and even false, but not demonstrably harmful,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nFacebook not doing enough to protect elections, critics charge\n\nHany Farid, a UC Berkeley professor who specializes in deepfakes and disinformation, gets daily inquiries about fake images on the internet, from Biden in military fatigues in the situation room to Trump with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. He says the use of warning labels for this kind of malicious content is \"cowardly.\"\n\nWhile the warning labels provide cover to Facebook, the average person doesn\u2019t care about the label or ignores it, he said. Most of the time those labels are not added until a video has gotten millions of views. What\u2019s more, anyone can then take that video and post it somewhere else without the label.\n\nAccording to Farid, Facebook, whose algorithms serve up content that stirs strong emotions, has been on the wrong side of this issue for the last 15 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to take Facebook seriously when they say we have these policies and it\u2019s clear those policies are in place to maximize their profits,\u201d he said.\n\nElection experts call for deepfake regulations\n\nAny efforts by social media companies to rein in doctored or AI-generated content should be paired with thoughtful standards crafted by regulators and policymakers, says Daniel Weiner, director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Elections and Government Program.\n\nWhile AI-generated depictions of Biden are quickly debunked, what about a local candidate for city council or the school board?\n\nLast year, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., launched a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing into the potential dangers of deepfakes by playing an AI-generated recording that mimicked his voice and read a ChatGPT-generated script.\n\n\u201cThe latest advances in AI technology, more than anything else, has reinforced the need to strengthen fundamental guardrails for our political system,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cThese problems existed before. They would exist if every deepfake disappeared tomorrow. And, a lot of times, the solutions aren\u2019t AI-specific. They are about the need for a broader strengthening of democracy.\u201d"}

They sent me a reel Zach and Donald had made which was basically shot on their iPhone.\n\n\u201cI laughed out loud, it was so funny.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the spot certainly delivers on the something-for-everyone ethos of the Super Bowl ad, which this year is costing $7 million to air 30 seconds of brand awareness to an audience expected to break the viewership record of 115 million, set in 2023.\n\nIn place of John Travolta and the \"West Side Story\"/\"Grease\" themes of past campaigns, Panay tabbed \"Aquaman\" star Jason Momoa as the third participant in a Super Bowl party gone awry due to poor home internet.\n\nThe trio pass the proverbial mic while belting out Irene Cara\u2019s iconic title single, which reached No. 1 for two weeks in 1983 and paved the way for the film to debut at No. 2 in its opening week and quickly move to No. 1.\n\nCara passed away at 63 in November 2023.\n\n\u201cThe way they treat the song \u2013 it\u2019s with love,\u201d says Beals. \u201cBeing on the set was just heaven.

He knows what he\u2019s doing and he\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d\n\nNaturally, water is ultimately involved.\n\nBeals\u2019 appearance is brief but noteworthy and borne of the main characters workshopping lines over and over as she stands on the balcony of the suburban dwelling.\n\n\u201cShe came through and acted as both participant in the spot and consultant,\u201d says Peter De Luca, chief creative officer for T-Mobile. \u201cShe is the original; she provided coaching for Momoa. It was kind of fun to witness that in action, in real time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re appealing at all different levels of audience but in the end, we believe it\u2019s an ensemble piece that will appeal to everyone.

The Super Bowl is unique from all other North American sports in that it doesn't use a year to signify its championship game, but instead numbers.\n\nBut to make it even more confusing, instead of using a numerical digit, the NFL uses Roman numerals to number the Super Bowl, which likely confuses viewers seeing the logo since its a system rarely used in today's world. So to help avoid the confusion, here's a quick guide to Roman numerals and the Super Bowl.\n\nWhat Super Bowl is it?\n\nThis season's NFL championship game \u2014 Super Bowl LVIII \u2014 is Super Bowl 58.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nHow to read Roman numerals\n\nRoman numerals use letters of the alphabet and used in combination the higher the number. Here are what the symbols are for 1-10:\n\n1: I\n\n2: II\n\n3: III\n\n4: IV\n\n5: V\n\n6: VI\n\n7: VII\n\n8: VIII\n\n9: IX\n\n10: X\n\nWhen it comes to number prefixes or suffixes on the letters, IV could be read as \"one less than four,\" or VIII can be read as \"three more than five.\" So for example, XIV is 14 and XVII is 17. When it gets to any number after 19, you use as many X's for every 10. Example, XXXIII is 33, or \"three more than 30.\"\n\nBut when the number gets to 50, L is used as the first numeral, which is why it's in this year's logo. So for example, Super Bowl Bowl 65 will be Super Bowl LXV.\n\nAfter that, new letters aren't introduced until 100. Then, 100 is C, D is 500 and M is 1,000. So the year 2024 is MMXXIV.\n\nThe only time the NFL didn't use a Roman numeral was Super Bowl 50, likely because it didn't want it to be Super Bowl L.\n\nIf it's still confusing or hard to remember, then just read a USA TODAY story mentioning the Super Bowl. Here, Super Bowls are always referred to in numerical digits, so Super Bowl 58 is used.\n\nWhy does the NFL use Roman numerals for the Super Bowl?\n\nThe confusing number choice for the Super Bowl dates back all the way to the very first one.\n\nThe idea came from late Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, who also came up with the name \"Super Bowl.\" According to the NFL, Roman numerals were used to avoid any confusion that could happen since the championship win is recognized the year the season started and not the year in which it ended. Example, the winner of this year's Super Bowl will be recognized as the 2023 champions, not the 2024 champions.\n\nThe league says the Super Bowl term was first officially used with Super Bowl 3, and Roman numerals were first used in Super Bowl 5. The league later added Super Bowl and Roman numerals to the first four editions."}

As Swift was poised to make Grammys history, she made sure to fangirl over as many of her industry colleagues as possible, standing and singing along to most of the performances, even if she was the only one in her section doing so. And Beyonc\u00e9 kept a relatively low profile as she, Jay-Z and Blue Ivy Carter graced the ceremony for a brief time.\n\nHere's what it was like inside the show \u2013 and backstage! \u2013 and take a peek at all the moments you didn\u2019t see on TV.\n\nTaylor Swift sings along to Olivia Rodrigo, beelines for Ice Spice after best new artist loss\n\nWith each commercial break, the A-listers and their guests seated at the front of the house had the opportunity to mix and mingle.\n\nThis allowed admirers to fawn over Swift and request selfies with her when she was on the move, massive train crumbled in one hand like a huge wad of tissue. (Her publicist and security guard deterred most from approaching whenever she\u2019d remain seated at her table with Jack Antonoff, Margaret Qualley and Lana Del Rey). But these breaks also gave the album of the year winner the chance to fangirl over her favorite artists, too.\n\nAt one point, Swift made a beeline for three-time winner boygenius \u2013 which includes \u201cRed (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d collaborator Phoebe Bridgers \u2013 and Bo Burnham, who was seated with the trio, and enthusiastically hugged the group. She spent nearly an entire commercial break with SZA, briefly chatted with longtime friend Ed Sheeran and, when the ceremony cut to a break after Victoria Mon\u00e9t\u2019s best new artist win, Swift shot up out of her seat, crossed to the other side of the stage-front area and had a conversation with Ice Spice for a few minutes.\n\nAs Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs sang their \u201cFast Car\u201d duet, Swift swayed along with the melody, her back corset strings moving along with her beat. When Olivia Rodrigo launched into the second chorus of \u201cVampire,\u201d Swift got up out of her seat and appeared to know every word of the track as she sang and danced along.\n\nJay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9 and Blue Ivy cause commotion in the VIP area\n\nAfter Jay-Z accepted the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award with a brutally honest speech in which he showed he wasn\u2019t afraid to call out the Recording Academy, his and Grammy-winning daughter Blue Ivy\u2019s return to their seats, which they didn\u2019t arrive at until well into the three-hour show, was met with flashes that could be seen clear across the arena.\n\nAs a crowd gathered to bask in the Carters\u2019 aura, Beyonc\u00e9 kept a lower profile (as much as possible when you\u2019re Beyonc\u00e9, anyway) from the vantage point of those not seated with the VIPs. Wearing a white wide-brimmed hat and sporting long, silver-white hair, the superstar didn\u2019t stray far from her family\u2019s table.\n\nThe Carters left as quickly as they came, seemingly departing during the break before Burna Boy took to the stage.\n\nBoygenius says this is really the end: 'Now we walk into the sunset'\n\nThe trio of Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus confirmed backstage that despite the critical success and fan adoration of their Grammy-winning 2023 album, \u201cThe Record,\u201d the recently announced boygenius hiatus is the end of the group.\n\n\u201cWe told each other at the beginning of the project that it would have a finite date, and we completed that time and now we walk into the sunset,\u201d Bridgers said.\n\nWhen asked if they had any plans to return, each of the musicians said, separately, a definitive \u201cno.\u201d\n\nBillie Eilish talks about 'life-changing' Greta Gerwig job for 'Barbie' soundtrack\n\nBillie Eilish and collaborator brother Finneas O'Connell entered backstage carrying their shared Grammy awards \u2013 best song written for visual media and best song for \"What Was I Made For?\" from the \"Barbie\" soundtrack \u2013 one in each of their hands.\n\nEilish, 22, discussed how the songwriting job from director/producer Greta Gerwig was a lifeline to get the creatively stalled duo back to writing music.\n\n\"We didn't really realize how life-changing it was going to be,\" said Eilish. \"It woke us up and got us back on our thing.\"\n\nAfter speaking about \"Barbie\" and \"being seen\" in the music industry, Eilish realized she hadn't let her brother pipe in with an answer.\n\n\"Sorry about that,\" Eilish said as they walked off the stage.\n\nCoco Jones won her Grammy while on the red carpet\n\nCoco Jones is just getting acquainted with her first Grammy for best R&B performance.\n\nThe \"Moment of Your Life\" singer was dealing with Los Angeles rain and the red carpet when her name was announced in the Grammys pre-show, she told reporters backstage.\n\n\"That's when I heard that I won that award,\" said Jones, looking at the Grammy in her hand. \"I'm really soaking it in right now looking at this award, thinking about my vision board where I edited my face onto that picture of Beyonc\u00e9 holding all her awards. It's just too surreal to really unpack right here.\"\n\nGaby Moreno \u2018never thought\u2019 she\u2019d receive Grammy recognition\n\nGaby Moreno, resplendent in a satin purple gown, said backstage that her award-winning \u201cX Mi (Vol, 1)\u201d album \u2013 her eighth \u2013 was the culmination of \u201cso many years of hard work.\u201d\n\nThe Guatemalan singer's win for best Latin pop album was the first of her career, and she said she \u201cnever in a million years thought I would receive recognition like this.\u201d\n\nMoreno confirmed the Feb. 16 release of her new album, \u201cDusk,\u201d which she described as \u201ca bit more American roots.\u201d\n\nSinging in English and Spanish on the new record, Moreno said she wants to inject more Latin into the roots genre.\n\n\u201cI feel it needs more Latin representation. I\u2019ve lived in the U.S. for 23 years and I want to keep representing my culture with the music that I do.\u201d\n\nKarol G wants to show \u2018Griselda\u2019 badness just like everyone else\n\nKarol G spoke out backstage about being the first woman to win the Grammy for best m\u00fasica urbana album. \u201cAs a woman, it\u2019s tough in this industry,\" the Colombian singer said. \"So I hold this with a lot of pride. I want to show girls we are made for big and great things.\"\n\nBig things like even more acting, as Karol G, 32, made her acting debut in Netflix's \"Griselda,\" playing a trusted confidant to Sofia Vergara's drug lord Griselda Blanco.\n\n\"I loved every moment on the set,\" Karol G said, beaming. \"And I'd love to be the bad girl in another series or a movie. Whichever.\"\n\nEven Grammy nominees Jelly Roll and Tyla aren\u2019t immune to the LA rain\n\nOn the red carpet \u2013 located inside a massive white tent on a street outside the arena \u2013 there was almost no sign that celebrities, donning outfits and accessories likely worth thousands of dollars, had to travel through any rain to put their best face forward for photographers and reporters.\n\nAlmost.\n\nAs the red carpet arrivals started shifting into high gear, Tyla \u2013 who won the inaugural best African music performance category \u2013 gracefully emerged through a billowing, wet opening in the tent on the reporters\u2019 side of the red carpet barricade with nary a raindrop on her ethereal green silk rope-like gown.\n\nOver at the red carpet exit, with 15 minutes to go until host Trevor Noah kicked off the ceremony, Jelly Roll and Bunnie Xo had a slight hesitation as they determined how to navigate an approximately 200-foot open-air trek to the next tent, which led to the arena doors. They allowed a few people to go ahead of them with the umbrella-wielding runners, who were transporting guests between the red carpet and the ceremony, before the best new artist nominee ushered his wife ahead of them and they braved the downpour together."}

Edey, continuing to make a strong case to repeat as national player of the year, finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds, and also recorded the 200th block of his career.\n\nSunday\u2019s decision closed out a rough week for the Badgers, who squandered a big lead three nights earlier in a loss at Nebraska and are now looking up at Purdue in the league standings.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of some other winners and losers from the busy start of February.\n\nWINNERS\n\nConnecticut\n\nThe Huskies, one of only four top-10 teams to avoid a loss this week, appear more than ready to mount a spirited defense of their 2023 national championship. On the big stage at Madison Square Garden, UConn took charge with a big second half against St. John\u2019s, keyed by its outstanding guard trio of Tristen Newton, Cam Spencer and Stephon Castle.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAny win against Duke is a good one as far as Tar Heels\u2019 fans are concerned. But UNC's wire-to-wire domination Saturday evening was particularly impressive as Armando Bacot and Harrison Ingram each turned in double doubles. The Blue Devils will get another crack at their archrivals in their own building, of course, but they\u2019ll need to do a better job matching the Heels\u2019 toughness.\n\nKansas\n\nAgainst one of the nation\u2019s best defensive teams, the Jayhawks came out on fire making nine of their first 10 shots and never looked back in their home win against Houston. KU now owns victories against two likely No. 1 seeds, having defeated Connecticut in Allen Field House in December. Kansas has been shaky at times away from its friendly confines, but the talent is there for the Jayhawks to be dangerous in March.\n\nTennessee\n\nZakai Zeigler delivered his best performance since returning from last season\u2019s devastating knee injury, pouring in 26 points and handing out a career-high 13 assists as the Volunteers shot the lights out in Kentucky\u2019s Rupp Arena. Josiah-Jordan James also broke out of a shooting slump with 26 points as UT bounced back from a mid-week loss to South Carolina.\n\nSan Diego State\n\nThe Aztecs were in no way in bubble trouble, but defending their home court against Mountain West leader Utah State was another good win to put in the bank for seeding purposes. The road loss isn\u2019t especially damaging for the Aggies, but they do need a quick turnaround with a red-hot Boise State squad coming to Logan in a week.\n\nBaylor\n\nDespite usually even-keeled coach Scott Drew earning his first career ejection, the Bears were able to stave off visiting Iowa State thanks to Jayden Nunn\u2019s tiebreaking bucket. Those points held up as the Cyclones\u2019 final shot was ruled to have come too late. Baylor\u2019s win and other results around the conference helped create a huge logjam at the top of the Big 12 leader board that should make for an interesting five-week home stretch.\n\nSaint Mary\u2019s\n\nA 20-point outing from Aidan Mahaney and a late three-pointer by Augustas Marciulionis helped the Gaels to a huge road win at Gonzaga. Their more ambitious non-league schedule this season now appears to be paying dividends as they find themselves two games clear in the West Coast Conference with a strong NET ranking that should serve them well should they need at-large consideration.\n\nVirginia\n\nDespite giving Clemson every opportunity to steal the victory, the Cavaliers survived on the road and ran their winning streak to six. That Quad 1 win will move them closer to the right side of the bubble, as long as they avoid further damaging losses.\n\nButler\n\nIn the most significant result from Friday night, the Bulldogs survived a wild finish at Creighton, running their winning streak to four and giving them a huge victory for their tournament hopes with more opportunities ahead in the Big East.\n\nIndiana State\n\nThe Sycamores will be a team worth keeping an eye on from the so-called mid-major ranks over the next month. They avenged their lone Missouri Valley Conference loss over the weekend by taking down Drake and now own a two-game lead and a 20-3 overall record.\n\nLOSERS\n\nKentucky\n\nThe Wildcats\u2019 defensive issues are no longer just a mild concern. They\u2019ve allowed five SEC opponents to score 90-plus points \u2212 the latest coming Saturday when Tennessee put up 103 in what was their second defeat at home last week. They were able to win one of those five games, but they can\u2019t count on outshooting teams in March.\n\nGonzaga\n\nWhether or not the Bulldogs have a legitimate beef with the officiating in the Saint Mary\u2019s loss, the fact is the team is still susceptible to long scoring droughts. With little of note on their at-large r\u00e9sum\u00e9, they\u2019re going to need to win the West Coast Conference tournament if they want to keep their streak of March Madness appearances alive.\n\nVirginia Tech\n\nBlessed with an opportunity to get closer to the tournament bubble, the Hokies let a double-digit lead get away at Miami, missing a chance for a good road result with few such opportunities remaining. The Hurricanes, on the other hand, got a much-needed win.\n\nKansas State\n\nThere aren\u2019t many games in the Big 12 that would qualify as bad losses, but the Wildcats\u2019 setback at last-place Oklahoma State fits the definition. K-State is now on a four-game slide and not exactly brimming with confidence as Kansas comes to town Monday night.\n\nFlorida\n\nIt was almost a great week for the Gators. But on the heels of their big win at Kentucky, they couldn\u2019t protect a 12-point lead at Texas A&M and saw their four-game winning streak snapped with a one-point loss."}

The stadium is the home venue of the Las Vegas Raiders, who moved to the city in 2020. In fact, this will mark the first time in NFL history that a Super Bowl will be played in the state of Nevada.\n\nLas Vegas becomes the 19th different host city and Allegiant Stadium becomes the 27th different venue to host a Super Bowl.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about Allegiant Stadium, home of Super Bowl 58.\n\nWhere is Allegiant Stadium?\n\nAllegiant Stadium is just west of the southern edge of Las Vegas Boulevard, more famously known as the Las Vegas Strip. That makes Allegiant Stadium quite accessible for guests staying at some of Las Vegas\u2019 more popular hotels and resorts on the Strip. For ease of transportation, the stadium is also very close to Harry Reid International Airport, the city\u2019s main hub, about a 15-minute drive away.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nWhat is the capacity of Allegiant Stadium?\n\nFor regular-season Raiders games, capacity of Allegiant Stadium is 65,000, though many venues that host Super Bowls typically can add seating for a game of that magnitude.\n\nThat makes Allegiant Stadium the fourth-smallest stadium in the NFL with Ford Field (65,000), State Farm Stadium (63,400) and Solider Field (61,500).\n\nWhat is unique about Allegiant Stadium?\n\nSimilar to the venue where last year\u2019s Super Bowl was played \u2013 State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., home of the Arizona Cardinals \u2013 Allegiant Stadium uses the area\u2019s constant sunshine to grow a grass field outside of the venue that is then rolled into the stadium with 72 individual motors. In fact, the sliding field tray weighs 19 million pounds, which is nearly as heavy as the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\n\nThere is also a 92-foot-tall memorial torch in honor of late Raiders owner Al Davis. Before every Raiders game, a guest honors Davis by lighting the torch, which is electronic and 3D-printed.\n\nWhat is the weather going to be at Allegiant Stadium?\n\nAllegiant Stadium is a domed venue, so it will be climate controlled for the Super Bowl, regardless of what the weather is outside in Las Vegas.\n\nWhen did Allegiant Stadium open?\n\nThe venue opened September 21, 2020, the day the Raiders played their first home game following their relocation to Las Vegas. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, Raiders owner Mark Davis made the decision to not host fans, citing safety concerns, so the team played its entire first season without fans.\n\nIt cost approximately $1.9 billion to construct. It quickly became known as the \u201cDeath Star\u201d because of its sleek, black and grey appearance, with a nod to the Star Wars movie franchise.\n\nAllegiant Stadium has also been the home of the Pac-12 Championship Game, the Las Vegas Bowl and UNLV football.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 58?\n\nThe game will be played February 11 at 6:30 p.m. ET."}

This is the fourth installment of the series.\n\nThe Super Bowl officially kicks off this week with press conferences, cliched quotes and Taylor Swift watch. There's one thing you won't see: Former NFL Network reporter Jim Trotter asking Roger Goodell questions.\n\nFor years, Trotter was one of the few journalists who when attending Goodell's Super Bowl press conferences asked the tough questions about the league and race. Trotter was always making good trouble as it's never easy being the Black guy asking the questions about race. If you ask, you're aLwySS taAlKinnG aBOuT rAce. If you don't, in some ways, you become part of the problem.\n\nTrotter always understood this, and the dangerous road it put him on, but Trotter didn't care. He'd ask Goodell why the NFL Network's mostly white management didn't reflect a league that was majority-players of color. This was always immensely brave because Goodell was essentially his boss.\n\nThis week, besides no Trotter, something else will be different about Goodell's Super Bowl press conference. He's having it on Monday when normally it's later in the week. It's also invite-only.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nAn NFL spokesman said in an email to USA TODAY Sports that starting the week on Monday with the commissioner rather than midweek, or at the end of the week, enables the media to focus on the players, the two teams and the events surrounding the Super Bowl.\n\nThat could be true but it doesn't seem believable. It seems more likely that Goodell is limiting the number of journalists who can ask him tough questions. Part of this, I believe, is the Trotter Effect.\n\nBut this moment is less about Goodell and more about the heroism of Trotter. He eventually sued the NFL for discrimination and Trotter said in a text message that lawsuit is continuing.\n\nWhat exactly is that fight? In many ways, it's not just about the NFL, but the larger issue of diversifying the workforce, and allowing employees to express concerns about that diversification (or lack of it) without repercussions.\n\nLast year, Trotter, as he'd done before, asked the commissioner about the absence of Black senior managers in the NFL Media newsroom and on the news desk.\n\n\"I'm not in charge of the newsroom,\" Goodell said. \"As you point out, this is the same question you asked last year.\"\n\nGoodell added that the NFL had reviewed many of its policies after Trotter had previously inquired about the same issue. Goodell said he was comfortable with the progress the NFL has made.\n\nTrotter's lawsuit says after publicly challenging Goodell, a direct supervisor of Trotter's asked one of his colleagues: \"Why does Jim keep bringing this up?\"\n\nThe answer (spoiler alert) is because nothing changed.\n\nEric Bieniemy passed over for NFL head coaching position yet again. Is the window closed?\n\nIn March, the lawsuit also says, another executive asked Trotter if he was \"in alignment\" with the NFL. Trotter\u2019s response, according to the complaint, is he was \"not in alignment with a newsroom that does not have Black representation in decision-making positions.\"\n\nA few weeks later, his agent was told Trotter's contract wasn't being renewed.\n\nThe NFL has denied Trotter's allegations saying in a statement: \"We share Jim Trotter\u2019s passion for quality journalism created in and supported by a diverse and inclusive environment. We take his concerns seriously but strongly dispute his specific allegations, particularly those made against his dedicated colleagues at NFL Media. Mr. Trotter\u2019s departure from NFL Media was one of many difficult decisions \u2212 similar to decisions recently made by many other media organizations \u2212 to address a challenging economy and a changing media environment. Jim was one of many employees who were unfortunately affected by these business decisions.\n\n\"We appreciate Jim\u2019s five years of service at NFL Media and wish him much success in his new role. The NFL has made significant strides in improving diversity and inclusion and, while we acknowledge there is always more work to be done, we are committed to continuing that progress.\"\n\nSports is the leading edge in the fight against racism. Read 29 Black Stories in 29 Days.\n\nSaid Trotter in a recent interview: \"People think I have animosity toward the NFL. I do not. I don't at all. All I'm asking the NFL to do is to be what it says it is. And, as journalists, isn't that our job? To hold the people in power accountable. To make sure that their actions reflect their words.\n\n\"So, for me, as I've said to Roger Goodell and others, diversity is good business, particularly in a league where your player population is 60 to 70 percent Black. It is also good business to have people who have shared these players as cultural backgrounds, their life experiences and whatnot at the table to help formulate a plan for how they are covered.\"\n\nHow long will Trotter be able to keep fighting the NFL? The league likes to grind down its opponents and maybe that will happen to Trotter. Maybe his case will be dismissed. For now, for right now, the fight continues."}

Not fake. My bad.", "domain": "usatoday.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMI7D-wowkqT0Ag", "text": "There was a moment after the AFC championship game when my world flipped on its head. That moment made me believe in love again. It was when Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce kissed.\n\nThe kiss looked ... real. The way a couple who know they have a future together kiss. It wasn't PR or something phony. It wasn't cooked in a lab by their agents. They both, in that moment, seemed genuinely happy. I can't believe I'm analyzing a kiss like I'm a teen back in the day reading Tiger Beat with Justin Bieber on the cover but here we are. They looked like a totally, wholly, magnificently legit couple.\n\nThey looked like they were wait...wait...hold on...in love?\n\nSome of you Swifties will say: welcome to the party, idiot. Where have you been? Do you know where I've been? Have you seen this cynical, cruel world we live in, where people think Swift is a Pentagon psyop and a dude who has been indicted 812 times is still a viable Presidential candidate? That's where I've been. Cynicism City. On the other side of the moon where it's very dark and no one lives.\n\nThat cynicism led to me writing a column in October, as their reported relationship became more public, with the headline: \"The Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce romance is fake. You know it is. So what? Let's enjoy it.\"\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\n\"You know it. Deep inside your soul. Where you tell yourself the truth,\" I wrote then. \"In fact, everyone knows it. Your friends. Your family. Your kids. The country. The President. Outer space. We. All. Know. It. We know the Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce romance is fake. Don't hate me for telling the truth that you already intuitively feel. You have told yourself this inevitable truth over and over as this story has washed over the nation. Your significant other even asked you recently: 'Do you think it's real?' And you replied: 'Of course it is.' You knew this was a lie and it landed you in therapy but you want to believe.\"\n\nYeah, that was wrong.\n\nIn fairness, some of it was tongue in cheek, but there was definitely an element of seriousness to it. We've all been fooled by sham celebrity romances and this, partly at least, felt like one. What's clear is that as time went on, and they were seen publicly more and more, it looked less and less fake. There was one signal that I ignored that may have been the biggest tell early on. It was when Kelce's brother, Jason, said this during a radio interview when asked about the budding relationship:\n\n\"It\u2019s hard to answer because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening in Travis\u2019s love life, and I try to keep his business his business and stay out of that world. But having said that, man, I think they\u2019re doing great, and I think it\u2019s all 100% true, and I hope that this thing goes the mile.\"\n\nJason later in the interview tried to say he was joking but of course we know he wasn't.\n\nAnother massive clue that the relationship was real came on the Kelce brothers' \"New Heights\" podcast after Swift attended her first Kansas City game in September.\n\n\u201cShout-out to Taylor for pulling up,\u201d Travis said. \u201cThat was pretty (gutsy). I just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her, the friends and family. She looked amazing, everybody was talking about her in great light, and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs\u2019 fans, of course. We script it all, ladies and gentlemen. It was impressive.\u201d\n\n\"To see the slow-motion chest bumps, to see the high fives with mom,\" he added, \"to see the (Kansas City fans) all excited she was there, that was absolutely hysterical, and it was definitely a game that I\u2019ll remember, that\u2019s for ... sure.\"\n\nShe started attending more games. She hung with Kelce's mom. She attended more games. She hung with mom more. She met dad. Kelce went to the Eras Tour in Argentina. Then came another pivotal moment when Kelce seemed to realize just how galactic Swift is.\n\nMORE:Jason Kelce praises 'unbelievable role model' Taylor Swift and defends NFL coverage\n\n\"Obviously, I\u2019ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them. \u2026 I\u2019ve never dealt with it,\" he said. \"But at the same time, I\u2019m not running away from any of it. \u2026 The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she\u2019s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that, I better not be the one acting all strange.\"\n\nWe might be witnessing something that on the surface seems phony but is actually quite earnest. These are two people who care for each other; one a superstar entertainer, the other a future Hall of Famer, and there's nothing rigged or staged or shady about it. It's just a cool story.\n\nKelce will be asked non-stop questions this week about Swift and he'll handle them with humor and a smile as he has for months now.\n\nSo, yes, I was wrong. This is real.\n\nSee you at the wedding."}

NASA made the announcement on Jan. 25.\n\n\"That remarkable helicopter flew higher and farther than we ever imagined and helped NASA do what we do best \u2013 make the impossible, possible,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a statement.\n\nUSA TODAY looks back on the accomplishments of Ingenuity and its NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory team and how it exceeded its initial objectives:\n\nKey moments for Mars Ingenuity helicopter\n\nIngenuity was sent to Mars as a test vehicle to see if controlled flight was possible. It carried no scientific instruments and was intended as a 30-day, short-term experiment.\n\nIts thin carbon-fiber blades rotated at 2,400 rpm, allowing it to fly in the thin Martian atmosphere, which is 99% less dense than Earth\u2019s. It also had to survive night temperatures of -130 degrees Fahrenheit and use its solar panel to charge its batteries.\n\nIts first flight, a simple one, was on April 19, 2021. The craft rose 10 feet straight up in the air, hovered for 30 seconds, then landed.\n\nThe next four test flights lasted longer and were successful. NASA extended the Ingenuity mission on March 15, 2022. The helicopter acted as a scout and route planner for the Perseverance rover.\n\nHow were Ingenuity's rotor blades damaged?\n\n\u201cWe believe with Flight 72, we had a blade strike with the surface of Mars,\u201d said Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity project manager, in a NASA livestream on Jan. 31. \u201cWe have images showing damage to our rotor blades.\u201d\n\nBased on images they've seen, the Ingenuity team suspects all four blades are damaged, Tzanetos said.\n\nIngenuity guides itself with its onboard computer. Controllers can transmit flight plans to the craft, but Mars is too far from Earth for direct guidance.\n\nThe helicopter uses a downward-pointing navigation camera and a laser altimeter to relay directional information to its computer. The craft used large rocks and other visual clues on the surface to navigate in flight.\n\nOn the 72nd mission, Ingenuity flew over a featureless stretch of sand that may have confused the navigational instruments, causing the craft to tip to one side while descending, allowing the thin carbon-fiber blades to strike. The craft briefly lost contact with Perseverance while landing, but communications were reestablished later.\n\nWhat's next for Ingenuity?\n\nIngenuity landed upright in Neretva Vallis, a dry river valley that wanders into the western edge of Jezero Crater. Its systems are intact and it has power from its solar panel.\n\nControllers will test the helicopter's rotors by adjusting their angles and slowly rotating them. They won't attempt another flight.\n\n\"We're trying to understand what the moments of the impact looked like and the state of the rotor system,\" Tzanetos said.\n\nDepending on science priorities, the Perseverance rover will be repositioned within sight of the helicopter, a few hundred yards away, and take video of rotor blade tests.\n\n\"That will show us the other side of the rotor system,\" Tzanetos said. That will allow more damage assessment. Other tests are being considered.\n\nWill more helicopters be sent to Mars?\n\nNASA plans to send the Sample Retrieval Lander to Mars in 2028. That spacecraft, about the size of a two-car garage, will land on the surface and be loaded with rock and soil samples collected by Perseverance.\n\nIt will then launch from Mars and take the samples back to Earth, with a planned arrival in 2033.\n\nTwo Sample Recovery Helicopters, about the same size as Ingenuity, will be sent with the Sample Retrieval Lander. They'll help Perseverance load samples into the lander. The helicopters will have wheels to allow them to travel short distances on the surface and arms with two-fingered grippers to carry sample tubes.\n\n________\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; NASA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology; Associated Press; space.com; Planetary Society"}

This makes the fruit a healthy treat for humans. But what about your pooch?\n\nSome \"human foods\" are deemed OK for canine consumption, including apples and blueberries. While others, like chocolate and grapes, are off-limits.\n\nIt's hard to keep track of every single human food your dog is allowed to eat, especially if they are constantly begging for a bite of what you're snacking on. So before you give your dog some pineapple, here's what you need to know.\n\nCan dogs eat pineapple?\n\nYes, dogs can eat pineapple. Ripe, raw pineapple can be a good alternative to treats for your pup, according to Hill's Pet Nutrition.\n\nSince pineapple is packed with nutrients and minerals, such as vitamin B6 and potassium, it is a \"nutrient-dense snack for humans and dogs alike,\" the American Kennel Club reports. It can also benefit your pet's immune system and digestion.\n\nCan dogs eat strawberries?And if so, how do you feed them safely?\n\nAre pineapples toxic to dogs?\n\nPineapple is not toxic to dogs. However, there are some factors to consider when feeding pineapple to your dog.\n\nThe fruit is high in sugar. If it is given as a snack, it should be done in moderation and small amounts. If your dog eats too much sugar, it could lead to weight gain or diabetes, according to Purina, a pet care company.\n\nPineapple is also high in fiber. While this can aid your pet's digestion, consuming too much fiber may cause issues. This includes causing stomach problems, constipation or diarrhea, Hill's Pet Nutrition reports.\n\nYou should avoid feeding your dog dried or canned pineapple.\n\nWhen fruit is dried, water is removed, causing it to shrink. Its sugar content will remain the same despite its smaller size, Purina reports. As a result, it's easy to lose track of portions when consuming dried fruit.\n\nAdditionally, canned pineapple is usually stored in syrup. The syrup is high in sugar, which is a major no-no for dogs, according to the American Kennel Club.\n\nCan dogs eat watermelon?Ways to feed your pup fruit safely.\n\nHow much pineapple should I give my dog?\n\nLike any other human food, you should give pineapple to your dog in small amounts. Monitor how much they are eating. A general guideline for treats is that they should exceed no more than 10% of your pet's daily calories, according to Hill's Pet Nutrition.\n\nConsult with your veterinarian to see if there may be any issues, such as diabetes, that could impact your dog's eating habits. If you do feed your dog pineapple, give them a small bite to see if they experience any digestive issues.\n\nWhen feeding pineapple to your dog, be sure to remove the core and peel. Consuming these could cause an intestinal blockage, Hill's Pet Nutrition reports.\n\nJust Curious for more? We've got you covered\n\nUSA TODAY is exploring the questions you and others ask every day.

Jason Holtzman, director of the federation's Jewish Community Relations Council, offered sandwiches and cookies from the catered lunch for people to take home. Carl Day, pastor of Culture Changing Christians and a Black community organizer, offered goodbye hugs and handshakes.\n\nNo one seemed to be in a hurry to leave, and that was the point: Jewish and Christian, white and Black people were talking, laughing and enjoying one another's company after a session sharing their hopes, concerns and thoughts on how to make Philadelphia \u2212 and the world \u2212 better.\n\nOn a whiteboard, they'd written some very ambitious goals and brainstormed ideas: \"violence prevention\" and \"anti-racism,\" along with \"amplify Black voices,\" \"support affordable housing for POC (people of color)\" and \"push for investment back into the community.\"\n\nPhiladelphia is not the only place where Black and Jewish groups are working to forge and strengthen alliances at a time fraught with racial and antisemitic incidents. Historic bonds are being built and rebuilt in cities across the U.S.\n\n\"The American experiences for the Black and Jewish communities are of people who were able to see opportunities for advancement while working and fighting for justice alongside each other,\" Day said.\n\nHistorical alliances, modern challenges for Black and Jewish people\n\nIn Philadelphia, the fortunes of Black and Jewish people converged, then diverged, Holtzman told USA TODAY.\n\nIn the years before and during World War II, Jewish immigrants fleeing European antisemitism and shunned elsewhere in the U.S. were welcomed into Black neighborhoods. Professionals and intellectuals, unable to find work in prestigious, white-dominated institutions, were hired at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).\n\nJewish people were among the NAACP's founders and were some of the strongest allies for Black people during the Civil Rights era, well represented among the Freedom Riders and marchers advocating for voting rights and racial integration.\n\nBut as disinvestment and white flight took hold in Philadelphia's working class-neighborhoods, many Jewish people moved out of the city and into suburban towns. Black people were left behind, confined by housing discrimination in the suburbs, their children stuck in failing schools and their neighborhoods neglected and left to deteriorate.\n\n\"The history is very rich, and it's been a two-way street in my opinion,\" Holtzman said. \"It was always the two communities standing together, and that's the spirit we want to get back into.\"\n\nDay, whose congregation is based in North Philadelphia and Kensington, two neighborhoods that struggle with gun violence, poverty and drug activity, agreed. \"There was passion on both sides while facing the potential for violence. There was a monumental level of hatred directed at both communities,\" he said.\n\nBut while Jewish people's fortunes rose, in part because it was easier for them to integrate into white society, Holtzman said, that wasn't always the case for Black people.\n\n\"As there's advancement and success, there's also responsibility,\" Day said. \"You get lost in your own responsibilities, whether you're a business owner or a landlord. And then you begin to pay less attention to others' plight.\"\n\nThere are similar dynamics at play in Cleveland, home to Rekindle Fellowship, and in Detroit, home to the Coalition for Black and Jewish Unity.\n\nCharmaine Rice, who co-founded Rekindle Fellowship with Matt Fieldman in 2021, is the daughter of a serviceman who lived in Germany for part of her childhood. It wasn't until her father was transferred Stateside \u2212 to Biloxi, Mississippi \u2212 that she heard the \"n\" word.\n\nWhen she moved to Cleveland, she said, she was struck by how racially segregated the city is. She met Fieldman through his wife, and on a Shabbat visit to their home, was impressed by how welcoming they were, how kindly and patiently they answered her mother-in-law's questions about their faith and culture. She and Fieldman looked for groups that fostered relationships between Black and Jewish people, and, finding none, started their own.\n\nIn Detroit, Rabbi Asher Lopatin of the Coalition for Black and Jewish Unity described a place where \"everyone gets along well,\" but acknowledged, \"I can't say there are the best relationships.\"\n\n\"You really in many ways have two communities that are very separated,\" he said.\n\nRebuilding bridges between Jewish and Black people\n\n\"We're better together,\" said Holtzman, who believes Jewish and Black Americans can form a powerful bloc to advocate for the changes that will benefit them both.\n\n\"It\u2019s 2024, an election year, and racism and antisemitism have risen to high levels,\" he said. \"We're seeing all these conspiracy theories and people being misinformed. The Black community (in Philadelphia) is dealing with gun violence and poverty.\n\n\"We want to stand up for each other. Often, the same people who attack Jewish people are the ones who attack Black people.\"\n\nThe 16-person cohort he and Day lead meets monthly for formal discussions, but also informally for meals, comparative religious study and small get-togethers. They're planning trips to Civil Rights landmarks, the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture and the U.S. Holocaust Museum, Philadelphia City Council meetings, and even a trip to Israel.\n\n\"In America, we like to say history is repeating itself, but the truth is nothing ever really changed,\" Day said. \"A lot of the politics over the last four to eight years, the veil of racism has come off. So we wanted to say, it's time for us to create bridges, a table where we all can come together. Our mission is to enhance each other's work and get a greater understanding of each other's plight.\"\n\nThat extends to difficult topics such as the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nLopatin, the Detroit rabbi, said that since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and the war it sparked, \"we've spoken about Israel, not always agreeing, but feeling the support.\"\n\nMichigan has a substantial Arab American and Muslim American community, and Lopatin said he's worked with them, admitting, \"It's been more challenging since Oct. 7.\"\n\n\"I would say everyone here gets along, but separately,\" he said. \"There's not a lot of tension, and I've gone to Dearborn (where, the Detroit Free Press recently reported, a majority of residents are of Arab ancestry), even into a Yemeni cafe, and felt safe and welcome as a Jewish person.\"\n\nThe challenge, he said, \"is going beyond just getting along with each other and working together to make the city better for everyone.\"\n\nThe coalition launched a leadership academy for Black and Jewish high school students, has taken trips to Civil Rights landmarks in the South and the Holocaust and African American Museums in Washington, D.C., aided in refugee resettlements and lobbied state lawmakers for a safe driving bill for undocumented immigrants to get drivers licenses.\n\nFieldman, a self-described \"white Jewish kid\" who grew up in Florida, said when he learned about the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and '60s, \"it was a real point of pride in the Jewish community that we worked with Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"But we were taught that the good guys won and everyone could go home,\" he said. \"As I got older, I realized that wasn't true.\"\n\nAfter moving to Cleveland 17 years ago, he saw two very different communities, Black and Jewish, \"working parallel but not in partnership.\" He and Charmaine Rice set out to change that.\n\nToday, Rekindle offers 15 hours of workshops and discussions that are meant to lead to action. In the wake of the murder of George Floyd in 2020, Fieldman said, Black people told him, \"We're tired of talking about being Black,\" and they wanted actions to back up well-intentioned discussions. Rekindle's teams select projects they can pursue together, such as criminal justice reform and voter registration drives. There are fun activities, too, such as a combined celebration of Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa.\n\nThe nonprofit's curriculum is free to any group that wants to launch its own fellowship.\n\n\"Jewish folks felt like they did what they had to do, but there's more to be done,\" Fieldman said. \"Allyship can't be transactional; it has to be about relationships, rather than just talking about something that happened 60 or 70 years ago that our grandparents did.\"\n\n\"The goal is to talk things through and try to come to an understanding of each other,\" Rice said. \"We remind people to be open to all the kernels of truth in each person's story, to come to one another with respect and engage in meaningful dialogue, to build connections where we can feel each other's hearts.\"\n\nContact Phaedra Trethan by email at ptrethan@usatoday.com, on X (formerly Twitter) @wordsbyphaedra, or on Threads @by_phaedra."}

Biden will deliver a message recognizing this week as \"Community Violence Awareness Week.\"\n\nWhite House officials will later host a roundtable discussion on gun violence with Black elected officials from across the country. It will be followed by a virtual workshop to connect state and local leaders to federal resources to address gun violence including community safety programs.\n\nThe week, which coincides with Black History Month, will culminate Friday with a White House ceremony hosted by Vice President Kamala Harris to honor 31 graduates of the inaugural class of trainees from the University of Chicago Crime Lab\u2019s Community Violence Intervention Leadership Academy.\n\n\"Gun violence is a public health crisis that impacts our communities every day,\" said Greg Jackson, deputy director of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. \"And while we know we need action from Congress, there's a lot we can do to create an all-of-government approach to this health crisis, and our team is charged with that.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nBiden launched the Office of Gun Violence Prevention in September to expedite the implementation of executive actions he's taken on gun violence and measures in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which passed in 2022 as the first significant overhaul in federal firearms laws in 30 years.\n\nThe law created a $750 million funding pot to incentivize states to create \"red flag laws,\" which allow police or family members to get a court order that temporarily confiscates firearms from individuals who pose a danger.\n\nBiden has responded to mass shootings in the U.S. by repeatedly calling on Congress to take additional action: reinstate a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and pass legislation requiring gun background checks with gun purchases.

US needs paid leave", "domain": "usatoday.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMI7D-wowkqT0Ag", "text": "Eman Quotah\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nSixteen years ago, I went into early labor, was prescribed hospital bedrest and then gave birth to my son three months early. He stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for two months, and it was one of the hardest times of my and my husband's lives. I visited the hospital twice a day and pumped breast milk frequently at home while trying to recover mentally and physically from a very difficult birth. My husband worked and visited our son in the evenings.\n\nWhen our baby came home, we didn't want to send him to day care for the first year because he was at high risk for infections like RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). My parental leave ran out by the time my son reached 40 weeks gestational age, and I was lucky and grateful to have managers who worked with me to figure out how to give me the time I needed to care for my family, allowed me to work part time for nearly a year, and let me come back to work full time when I was ready.\n\nTwo and a half years later, the same employer accommodated me again when my daughter was born nearly two months early. Without their understanding, I could have been out of a job, twice \u2013 in the same shoes as Marissa Hughes, the employee who recently accused the trendy Texas bamboo-baby-clothing company Kyte Baby of letting her go after she requested to work remotely while her adopted baby was treated in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\n\nHow 'Barbie' honors moms:Greta Gerwig deserves more than an Oscar for portrayal of motherhood in 'Barbie'\n\nKyte Baby controversy isn't unique for American parents\n\nAfter outraged former customers filmed themselves throwing out Kyte Baby outfits and vowing to boycott the company, the CEO apologized twice and the company has said it is reviewing and updating its policies.\n\nThe TikTok-fueled controversy showed that consumer pressure can work to make companies create better policies, and perhaps other companies will follow suit. But boycotting Kyte Baby or any other employer won\u2019t change the problem at the crux of this story: Individual employers and families shouldn\u2019t have to figure out how to work around our shoddy systems and policies.\n\nAnd in a country where 1 in 10 babies is born prematurely, parents shouldn't have to go back to work if their child is in the NICU or needs care in the first months because they're worried about running out of leave.\n\nWe all want to support parents through pregnancy and birth, but in the United States we don't have the systems to adequately do that. We\u2019re the only high-income nation that does not have nationwide, mandatory, paid leave for parents after a child\u2019s birth or adoption.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem for all new families, but especially when pregnancy and birth don't go as planned, which is unfortunately the case for too many parents in our nation. We have the highest maternal death rate among affluent countries, and our premature birth rate is also high. On its annual infant and maternal health report card, the March of Dimes last year gave the nation a D+.\n\nIf my child came home with that grade, I\u2019d tell them to work harder.\n\nWe need paid, long-term parental leave \u2013 period\n\nAs a nation, we\u2019re not working hard enough to care for women and babies either before or after birth. And we\u2019re not offering leave to everyone equally.\n\nOur federal Family and Medical Leave Act means that some employees get up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave with job protection. And according to the Center for American Progress, only 11 states and Washington, D.C., have passed paid family and medical leave laws.\n\nMore than half of Americans lack access to short-term disability insurance often used to pay for maternity leave, and those who make less money or work part time have the least access.\n\nIn other words, our policies are an inequitable patchwork. And families like Hughes\u2019 and mine that face birth complications have needs that are not well addressed by government and company policies.\n\nPaid family leave has been found to have many benefits for child and maternal health and child development, including reducing the likelihood of preterm and low-weight births. We need paid, long-term family leave policies that ensure families can take the time they need to care for and bond with their infants.\n\nIf we don't put the right systems in place, we lose the opportunity to nurture families at a crucial time and enable them to thrive.\n\nI became a doctor as a single Black mom.The 'pro-life' movement didn't help me.\n\nLast month, the House bipartisan working group on paid leave released a draft framework that aims to make leave available to more people through a combination of policies, including tax incentives for small businesses. That\u2019s a start, but of course a draft plan is a long way from passing a bill through a divided Congress.\n\nIn its press release announcing it would be revisiting its policies, Kyte Baby said that it \u201cneeds to stand by their values of being a woman owned, family company.\u201d\n\nLike people everywhere, Americans love our families. Let\u2019s show our values by putting pressure on our policymakers to make paid family leave a reality for everyone who needs it, including the most vulnerable babies and their families.\n\nEman Quotah is a communications consultant and novelist in Rockville, Maryland."}

Could Trump, who promised when he first ran for president that he'd shepherd in an era of 'so much winning', wind up the loser in his blockbuster and historic case that's being argued before the Supreme Court this week?\n\nOn Thursday, Trump's lawyers will appear before the justices when they consider whether he incited an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021 and can be disqualified from returning to the White House. Seated on the bench will be the three justices he appointed, as well as three others appointed by past Republican presidents.\n\nWhile Trump has scored some big victories from this 6-3 conservative Court, most notably eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion, his record is surprisingly spotty.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump: the worst Supreme Court record since the Roosevelt administration\n\nAfter Trump lost re-election in 2020, the court threw out a Texas lawsuit aiming to overturn the results in four battleground states.\n\nThe court has also allowed New York City prosecutors and Congress to get his tax records and didn\u2019t stop the congressional committee investigating Jan. 6 from accessing presidential documents. The justices also declined Trump\u2019s request to get involved in the dispute over classified documents seized at his Mar-a-Lago club in 2022.\n\nAnd Trump's administration had the worst record at the Supreme Court of any administration since at least the Roosevelt administration, according to data developed by law professors Rebecca Brown and Lee Epstein for an article published in Presidential Studies Quarterly.\n\n\"Whatever the politics of members of this Supreme Court, the Court has a track record in cases involving Donald Trump of standing strong for oversight and accountability and for checks on his abuses of power,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the watchdog group representing the Colorado voters challenging Trump\u2019s ballot eligibility. \u201cGiven that, we expect the court to give this case a fair hearing and to decide it based on the facts and the law.\"\n\nStephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said Trump\u2019s past losses at the court are noteworthy because he might have been expected to have had more wins from a conservative court.\n\nBut they're not likely to indicate how the court will decide the Colorado case, which has much greater significance for the nation, he said.\n\nInstead, Vladeck sees the moment as similar to the court\u2019s past decisions on desegregation and whether President Richard Nixon had to turn over the Watergate tapes when the justices tried to play neutral arbiter and lower the temperature.\n\n\u201cBut I don't know what that looks like,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not obvious to me where there'd be some kind of `everyone-gets-something-ruling\u2019 that might draw justices from both ends of the bench. And I feel like that's what we need right now. What we need is the court to speak in a way that is not going to further exacerbate the political tensions at the moment.\u201d\n\nIs a second Trump presidency another chance for him to shape the Supreme Court?\n\nThe Colorado dispute is not the only time the Supreme Court could decide Trump\u2019s future. It\u2019s considering a challenge to how federal prosecutors are going after Jan. 6 rioters in a case that could also affect the federal charges against Trump for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election. In addition, Trump is expected to ask the Supreme Court to rule that, as a former president, he\u2019s immune from prosecution.\n\nIf Trump survives all legal challenges and convinces voters to return him to the White House, he might be able to further solidify the conservative supermajority he helped create on the court.\n\nThat would only deepen the ties between the Supreme Court and Trump\u2019s political fortunes that began in 2016.\n\nHe won over the GOP\u2019s Christian right in part by vowing to select Supreme Court justices who would oppose abortion rights, a move he said could \u201cautomatically\u201d lead to the court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nThat happened in 2022 with the support of the three justices he appointed: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. The court\u2019s conservative supermajority also set new standards for evaluating gun laws and struck down affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nFor Trump, eliminating the right to an abortion was 'a miracle'\n\nTrump\u2019s transformation of the court was one of his biggest accomplishments, especially because all of three of his nominees are under age 60.\n\nIf Trump becomes president again, he could have a chance to replace the two oldest conservatives \u2013 Justices Clarence Thomas, 75, and Samuel Alito,73 \u2013 with younger justices who could keep the supermajority going far into the future.\n\n\u201cThe next election is so important for the Supreme Court and people have not focused on that yet, because very likely, if Trump wins, Alito and Thomas retire and are replaced with much younger and even crazier right-wing judges,\u201d Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, recently said on the podcast he co-hosts.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is hoping the court overturning the five-decade-old constitutional right to an abortion will help him stop Trump from doing that.\n\n\u201cHe describes the Dobbs decision as a `miracle,''' Biden said in Virginia last month at his first major 2024 campaign rally. ''But for American women, it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d Trump, Biden said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a clue about the power of women in America.\u201d\n\n`They go out of their way to show they are totally impartial'\n\nTrump\u2019s complaints about the Supreme Court during his \u201cSave America\u201d rally on Jan. 6, 2021, came weeks after the court said Texas couldn\u2019t challenge the 2020 election results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nHe suggested the justices \u201crule against me so much\u201d to appear impartial because \u201cthe story is that they\u2019re my puppets.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now the only way they can get out of that because they hate that it\u2019s not good in the social circuit.

While each of these are great ways of getting your heart rate up, toning your muscles and maintaining a healthy weight, they represent only one type of exercise.\n\nAnaerobic exercise represents another. \"Anaerobic exercise and aerobic exercise are two fundamental types of physical activity, each with distinct characteristics and effects on the body,\" says Austin \"Ozzie\" Gontang, a licensed psychotherapist at Pacific Pearl of La Jolla and the director of the San Diego Marathon Clinic.\n\nAnaerobic exercise, explained\n\nOne key difference is that anaerobic exercise is more intense but lasts for shorter amounts of time than aerobic exercise. Both exercises also use oxygen differently. \"Anaerobic literally means 'without air' while aerobic means, 'with air,'\u201d says David Herzberg, a physical therapist and owner of Launch Physical Therapy and Sports Performance Center in Phoenix. He explains that it gets this name because anaerobic activity is a type of \"fast and furious exercise\" where the body cannot bring in enough oxygen fast enough to provide energy to support the movement.\n\nBecause of this, the body taps a different energy source and breaks down glucose stores instead of turning to oxygen.\n\nAnother key difference between the two is that one is more about endurance training, the other more about strength training. \"Aerobic exercises generally improve endurance and cardiovascular health, whereas anaerobic exercises are better for building strength, muscle mass and power,\" explains Gontang.\n\nHow does anaerobic exercise benefit the body?\n\nAlong with toning and building muscle, Gontang says that anaerobic exercise also improves one's ability to withstand fatigue by increasing production of lactic acid. Lactic acid is a chemical that aids in higher energy levels, glucose generation and improved immune health through a process called molecular signaling, per Cleveland Clinic.\n\nOther benefits of anaerobic exercise include improved athletic performance, regulation of blood sugar levels, improved mental health and better cardiovascular health. \"While we typically associate heart health with aerobic activities, anaerobic exercise also contributes to cardiovascular health by improving blood pressure, reducing bad cholesterol levels and enhancing heart function,\" says Gontang.\n\nHerzberg says that anaerobic exercise can also improve bone strength and density, \"thus reducing risk of osteoporosis.\"\n\nOne of the most desired benefits that stem from anaerobic exercise is that it can also help with keeping unwanted pounds at bay. \"Anaerobic exercise can increase your resting metabolic rate - the rate at which your body burns calories when at rest,\" explains Gontang. \"Greater muscle mass means the body burns more calories even when not exercising, which can aid in weight management.\"\n\nDetails:What is a healthy resting heart rate? Experts explain why it matters.\n\nWhat are examples of anaerobic exercise?\n\nCommon examples of anaerobic exercise include weightlifting, sprinting, powerlifting, medicine ball drops and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Gontang also recommends bodyweight and resistance training exercises. \"Movements like push-ups, pull-ups and burpees are effective anaerobic exercises,\" he says. \"And they require no equipment and can be done anywhere, making them highly accessible.\"\n\nBen Fung, a clinical physical therapist and spokesperson for the American Physical Therapy Association, points to many of the same exercises for anaerobic benefits, but says optimal results come from adding in cardio exercise as well. \"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services physical activity guidelines state that adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week and at least two days of muscle-strengthening anaerobic activities,\" he says. He explains that a diversity of movements, ranges of motion, loads, frequencies, intensities and postures are a great way to alternate between both types of exercise. \"The body appreciates it when we give it various ways to load, train, strengthen, stretch and relax,\" he says.\n\nGontang similarly recommends keeping up with some form of regular cardio but adds that \"incorporating anaerobic exercises into your existing fitness routine can provide a balanced approach to physical health and well-being.\"\n\nIn case you're curious:The fastest way to lose weight?

The idea to tie the knot elsewhere sparked after the couple, who got engaged on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2022, attended a wedding for some friends in Jamaica. \u201cWe saw how easy it was for everyone to get around the resort,\u201d Kamerkar told USA TODAY. \u201cWe wanted to not make it just around the wedding. We wanted people to enjoy themselves.\u201d\n\nMexico seemed like a \u201cno-brainer,\u201d according to Shah. They had never been to the warm climate country, so that was already enticing and the locale seemed relatively \u201chassle-free\u201d for everyone to travel to. Most importantly, friends had recommended Mexican resorts that are well-experienced in hosting South Asian weddings and, specifically, Hindu ceremonies.\n\nHowever, there was one major hitch: \u201cWe were going in there blind,\u201d Kamerkar said.\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nMore newlyweds-to-be are considering destination weddings over getting married in their hometowns, according to Sarah Klingman, founder and CEO of Gather, an event-planning company that helps couples plan weddings on a project basis.\n\n\u201cThere is an element around social media and creating an enhanced curiosity for travel, for being really adventurous,\u201d Klingman told USA TODAY. \u201cWe\u2019re going on this adventure with each other and our friends and family.\u201d\n\nSince Kamerkar and Shah were saving up for a house at the time, the couple couldn\u2019t afford a trip to check out potential properties. \u201cWhere is this resort? Where\u2019s this at?\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have no idea, but we\u2019re planning our entire wedding at a place in a new country. It was eye-opening.\u201d\n\nBut it was worth it. \u201cThere was the excitement of everyone wanting to be there and enjoying themselves relaxing,\u201d Shah said. Guests came from California, Texas, Canada and even all the way from India.\n\nThe couple had two full days of events, and most of their guests stayed at the El Dorado Spa Resorts & Hotels resort for a few extra days to enjoy the beaches and amenities at their leisure while getting to know each other\u2019s family and friends. The couple could also infuse personalized touches into their itinerary, from hookah and henna during their welcome cocktail evening to honoring Denali, the Indian festival of lights, with sparklers.\n\n\u201c(Normal weddings can) go by in such an instant, and it\u2019s over too soon,\u201d said Jared Benoff, a destination wedding travel advisor for Vacationeeze. Benoff was the coordinator who helped the couple plan their wedding. \u201cThe beauty of a destination wedding is that it's four to five days. You get to spend time with friends and family outside of that formal cocktail hour.\u201d\n\nPlanning a wedding is already a stressful activity, and adding a layer of travel for a large group of people can make it even more challenging. Here are some key tips you need to know about planning a destination wedding, according to experts who make the magic happen.\n\n1. Not all resorts are created equal\n\nIn Benoff\u2019s opinion, choosing the right resort to host the wedding is the biggest and most difficult decision. What could be a great resort for a family-friendly vacation or honeymoon, or even have top reviews, may not be the right fit to tie the knot for a number of reasons. \u201cCouples find resorts on Instagram, and they get really excited because their pool is amazing, but their wedding team can\u2019t pull off a 100-person wedding event,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou want a resort that has planned enough weddings and has an understanding of planning weddings but isn't a wedding factory,\u201d Benoff added. \u201cIt makes a big difference when you get that special attention.\u201d This is where Benoff typically steps in: when the engaged know they want a destination wedding but feel overwhelmed and don\u2019t know how to navigate a resort\u2019s wedding offerings.\n\n2. Plan early, but not too early\n\n\u201cThe key to a destination wedding is really starting early,\u201d said Klingman. \u201cThe earlier, the better. They\u2019re planning a big trip at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nKamekar and Shah began planning their wedding a year prior to the event. They regularly sent out emails to keep guests updated on various stages of the process, such as booking the venue, renewing passports if needed, and arranging flights. These emails also included reminders for the hotel booking deadline.\u201cGive yourself more time than you think,\u201d Kamekar said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people moving back and forth, especially older relatives.\u201d\n\nThere is a caveat: plan too early and people can\u2019t book flights. According to Benoff, the sweet spot is around a year from when you start the process. This allows guests three to four months to determine their availability and start arranging travel plans. The final payments can then be made during the last three to four months leading up to the event. \u201cYou want to give your guests enough time to take off work and pay for travel. It goes back to the consideration factor,\u201d he said.\n\n3. Think about your priorities\n\nWith everything that goes into a destination wedding, it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s not even the right choice for some couples. \u201cThere are so many pros, but the one con is not every guest is going to be there,\u201d Klingman said. \u201cA lot of couples like the idea of a destination wedding but can\u2019t stomach the idea of a grandma not making it.\u201d\n\nIt really comes down to priorities. For some, it can be a grand adventure or create enhanced intimacy if it\u2019s a small wedding.\n\n\u201cIt's really an amazing opportunity to travel and see the world but also celebrate your growing circle,\u201d Klingman said. A destination wedding can also be an hour\u2019s drive away, not necessarily a trans-Atlantic flight to Italy.\n\nAt the end of the day, Klingman said not to take it personally if someone can\u2019t attend the wedding due to costs or limited time off.\n\n4. Yes, it can be cost-effective\n\nIn 2023, the average American wedding budget was $30,000, but many couples working with Benoff \u2013 who specializes in weddings in the Caribbean and Mexico with an average of 70 guests \u2013 can easily keep to an average budget of $17,000. The biggest factors are going to be the guest list and resort\u2019s wedding package.\n\nNearly every resort offers some sort of incentive, whether that be a comprehensive wedding package (\u201cyou\u2019re pretty much covered under that,\u201d Benoff said) or an offer like if your guests book a certain number of rooms, you get credit toward something like wedding decor or entertainment. \u201cIt takes mental accounting,\u201d he said.\n\n5. Offer some activities, but don\u2019t go crazy\n\nAnother perk of having a destination wedding is exploring the destination itself, and most guests stay around four nights. Benoff advises couples not to book too many activities so guests don\u2019t feel overscheduled. Opt for optional activities or just plan excursions when you\u2019re there. \u201cYou want a good experience, and I think part of that is giving your guests time to relax,\u201d he said.\n\nLos Angeles-based Daphne Haraburd and Daniel Tegnelia got married in Manhattan before Christmas and gave guests recommendations for hotels, restaurants and things to do, like exploring New York\u2019s iconic Christmas markets.\n\n6. Get some boots on the ground\n\nCalling herself a \u201cType A\u201d person who knew exactly what she wanted for her wedding, Haraburd attempted to plan things herself, but with her and Tegnelia working full-time and in a different time zone than the East Coast, she ended up hiring Klingman to help. Based near New York, Klingman scoped out Haraburd\u2019s venue list and showed the couple on videochat. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to do without it,\u201d Haraburd said. \u201cYou definitely need somebody who\u2019s there to help you in person.\u201d\n\nOn the evening of her 80-person wintertime wedding, Haraburd felt \u201cnervous\u201d that everything was going to come together just as she envisioned it.\n\nAround 90% of Benoff\u2019s clients have never been to the resort or even the destination before the big day. \u201cIt\u2019s so different than if you were planning local,\u201d Benoff said, in which you typically visit the venue multiple times. Ultimately, you\u2019re putting a lot of trust into your on-site planner who comes with the resort, a third-party coordinator like Benoff and the vendors.\n\nFor couples on the fence about a destination wedding, Tegnelia said to go for it. \u201cA lot of people remember their vacations, so to have a wedding on a vacation is twice as memorable.\u201d\n\nKathleen Wong is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Hawaii.

A new report should heighten concerns about the FBI\u2019s diligence.\n\nABC News reported Thursday that \u201cspecial counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team has questioned several witnesses about a closet and a so-called \u2018hidden room\u2019 inside \u2026 Trump\u2019s residence at Mar-a-Lago that the FBI didn\u2019t check while searching the estate in August 2022.\u201d In other words, Trump could still be in possession of highly sensitive documents.\n\n\u201cAccording to sources, some investigators involved in the case came to later believe that the closet, which was locked on the day of the search, should have been opened and checked,\u201d ABC noted. \u201cAs investigators would later learn, Trump allegedly had the closet\u2019s lock changed while his attorney was in Mar-a-Lago\u2019s basement, searching for classified documents in a storage room that he was told would have all such documents.\u201d Changing the locks would be powerful evidence to show what is known as \u201cconsciousness of guilt,\u201d which could be used in court to prove that any alleged obstruction was intentional and willful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegation of such slipshod conduct by the FBI leaves experienced prosecutors dumbfounded. Former federal prosecutor Joyce Vance wrote on Substack, \u201cOn the face of the reporting, it\u2019s difficult to figure out why FBI agents held off. The reporting seems to suggest agents encountered the closet, couldn\u2019t find the key, and decided to let it go.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s not clear they were even aware of the hidden area, although the Secret Service would have had a complete floor map for the area Trump resided in, and agents are trained to be alert for concealed spaces.\u201d\n\nFollow this author Jennifer Rubin 's opinions Follow\n\nAs Vance pointed out, it is not as if the search warrant limited the scope of the search. To the contrary, it covered any area where documents \u201ccould be stored.\u201d She found it \u201cinexplicable that agents didn\u2019t insist on being provided with a key or break the lock in order to look into the space.\u201d Other former prosecutors share her dismay.\n\nSuch an error might not raise suspicions had not reporting previously suggested that some inside the FBI objected to and foot-dragged on conducting any search. \u201cProsecutors argued that new evidence suggested Trump was knowingly concealing secret documents at his Palm Beach, Fla., home and urged the FBI to conduct a surprise raid at the property,\u201d The Post reported in March. \u201cBut two senior FBI officials who would be in charge of leading the search resisted the plan as too combative and proposed instead to seek Trump\u2019s permission to search his property, according to \u2026 four people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive investigation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI was so averse to conducting a search that some agents \u201cwanted to shutter the criminal investigation altogether in early June, after Trump\u2019s legal team asserted a diligent search had been conducted and all classified records had been turned over, according to some people with knowledge of the discussions,\u201d The Post reported.\n\nInstitutional aversion to a search might well have trickled down to the agents conducting the search, making them more inclined to tread carefully. If so, it would appear that Trump, far from being treated more harshly than other suspects, received kid-glove treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, did the agents conduct a thorough search, and, if they were uncertain about their authority, why did they not obtain clarification of the search parameters? It is not clear if agents who conducted the search reported their failure to thoroughly complete the search. (That arguably should have resulted in disciplinary action.)\n\nSecond, did investigators ever go back to Mar-a-Lago to determine what documents might remain? If investigators obtained information showing documents were \u201cmissed\u201d in the search, someone should have determined if the documents were subsequently moved or destroyed.\n\nThird, and most important, if these areas were never searched, we don\u2019t have a complete picture of the scope of the potential damage to national security. It boggles the mind to think we still might not know what documents went missing and what measures need to be taken as a result of compromised information.\n\nAdvertisement"}

The family of four lives in a one-bedroom apartment, with their daughters, 10 and 8, sleeping in what was originally the dining room. Furnished sparsely with antiques, everything is a subdued treasure.\n\nThe couple strike a look of earnest elegance: Sandeep has balletic poise and is the sort of person who is maddeningly lovely without makeup. If Carson has frays in the arms of a long-sleeved polo shirt, his wife will have the holes covered with ornate embroidery of his initials and hers. For Christmas, they gave each other repaired objects they already owned. (Even the vanity plate of Sandeep\u2019s vintage Saab reads \u201cNOT2MUCH.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe feeling of comforting asceticism reigns at Salter House, the store that the couple opened in 2018 a few blocks from their home in Brooklyn Heights, the upscale neighborhood where Truman Capote pedigree meets Edith Whartonian townhouses, home to journalists and actors as well as finance types.\n\nThe store is hard to describe; a Vermont Country Store for now-adult hipsters who have outgrown irony, perhaps. There are quilts and nightgowns, day dresses and bloomers, as well as porcelain and table linens and a line of pewter made by one of the country\u2019s last makers of original pewter goods. Everything is at once simple and extravagantly special: scissors, brooms, a toilet brush.\n\nSkip to end of carousel The Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting. For more Style stories, click here End of carousel Salter House is greater than the sum of its parts: not too much stuff, but just enough to transport you into the Salter family\u2019s domain. What the pieces have in common is Sandeep Salter. \u201cIt is truly a manifestation of our home life,\u201d says Sandeep, who grew up in England with an Indian father and American mother and speaks in the gentle voice you\u2019d expect from a very pragmatic Austen heroine (the sister who is really beautiful and grounded and eventually marries someone everyone thought incorrectly was a cad). Family and creativity are deeply entwined for Sandeep, 36, and Carson, 39: \u201cIt was Carson and I wanting to really, do a project together in a more permanent way,\u201d she says, of the store. \u201cAnd to have it really reflect our values as a family in a creative vision.\u201d When we first meet, she is wearing the company\u2019s Classic Cotton Day Dress in Primrose, a mid calf cotton dress with a stand-up collar that sells for $280, and bow-print tights with ballet flats, a style from a collaboration with shoe brand Loeffler Randall released in late January. Her hair is wrapped in a round piece of silk, a bun cover she recently began selling for $55. \u201cAll our leftover fabric on the cutting room floor, I gather up and make into other things. No waste.\u201d\n\nAsked to describe her eye, she speaks like an artist rather than a business founder with a sales deck. \u201cI\u2019m really concerned with the materials something is made of,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m always drawn towards something that I can understand the composition of, and I find beauty in that composition.\u201d Her parents were dancers, \u201cso we were in the studio all the time, and in the theater, [I was] watching them build sets,\u201d she says. \u201cProbably this world-building comes back to that.\u201d\n\nShe opened Picture Room, a gallery space, next door in 2017, and soon found that she wanted a place for her family and other neighborhood families to gather, that had sustainable home goods and toys, where things were beautiful but affordable. In 2021, the Salters introduced their own line of clothes, including nightgowns, corsets, bloomers and the aforementioned day dresses (all made in New York), and opened a Manhattan outpost in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe store has had a mark larger than its 700 square feet of sales space would suggest. The shop does a brisk e-commerce business, with Los Angeles as their biggest market after New York. She helped popularize the nightgown-ish (or actual nightgown) as casual errand-ware. Her day dresses are her bestsellers. Her candlesticks and pewter serving ware are popular hostess gifts. The French garden clogs she sells have become a staple of South Brooklyn and downtown wardrobes, and were the footwear for Emily Bode Aujla\u2019s first runway show in 2020.\n\nYou can see her influence at megabrands like Anthropologie, where the look of the mall chain\u2019s interiors offerings have evolved from upscale French hippie to English countryside. The cottagecore movement may not have been inspired by the Salters, per se, but Salter House (along with perhaps former Barneys fashion director Amanda Brooks\u2019s homegoods store in the Cotswolds, Cutter Brooks) is its purest form: the dream of the beautiful but not overly fussy home, where the internet is, like a city to a country mouse, a place you just visit from time to time for good cheese.\n\nChildren\u2019s toys are wooden; adult clothing is cotton or silk. Tablecloths are linen. Pewter is lead-free! Even the bagels have impressive provenance: \u201cOur starter began in Japan in 1974 by a monk and we are proud to be baking bagels with it in NY,\u201d explains the website of Bunny Bagel, whose baked goods are sold at the store.\n\n\u201cI definitely think that Salter House laid down the foundation for other businesses that have co-opted elements of the country lifestyle,\u201d says Sydney Gore, an editor at Architectural Digest. \u201cUnlike many of those that have followed in their footsteps, Salter House has thoughtfully curated an aesthetic that specifically invites marginalized communities to engage with craft, domesticity and identity. When you go into some of these other spaces, it just feels like colonial cosplay which can be really uncomfortable for BIPOC folks.\u201d\n\nFriends and collaborators are protective about the store\u2019s influence \u2014 \u201cI guess you could write it off as \u2018cottagecore,\u2019 but it\u2019s so much more,\u201d says Joana Avillez, an illustrator and friend of Salter\u2019s who sells her works at Picture Room.\n\nMina Alyeshmerni, who has sold Salter House clothing at her Los Angeles boutique Maimoun, says that while her clothes overlap with trends like cottagecore and the recent fad for bows \u2014 Salter House sells a $98 \u201cCotton House Bow\u201d \u2014 what has made it impactful is that it fills the void created by a technology-driven life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLiving in a world where we feel so disconnected yet we\u2019re all so connected, we\u2019re all longing for a time that once was,\u201d Alyeshmerni says. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s more impressive about her and her world.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a tongue-in-cheek joke,\u201d Carson says of the \u201cnot too much\u201d thing, speaking in the cafe a few weeks later. \u201cBut it\u2019s also dead serious.\u201d He has done branding and agency work on start-ups, and watched them grow exponentially only to suddenly crash and burn. Instead, \u201cit\u2019s more about establishing a kind of depth and richness with what we are doing.\u201d Sandeep arrives shortly thereafter, her hair down, with \u201cmy little sidekick,\u201d one of her daughters.\n\nStill, Carson says, \u201cbuilding a world or building a holistic practice, things like that, we\u2019re just \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStarting,\u201d Sandeep finishes.\n\nThe domestic goddess is not an unfamiliar path to success; it\u2019s what made Martha Stewart into a celebrity in American kitchens and on Wall Street. In Stewart\u2019s case, she was a woman who grafted a patriarch\u2019s capitalist ambition \u2014 a splashy IPO, a suite of products available in discount superstores, a media empire \u2014 onto a woman\u2019s domain.\n\nOver the past five years, amid the crash-and-burn of the girlboss and the pandemic, which made everyone look with new discernment at their homes, domestic-centered entrepreneurship has suddenly spiked. There is Hill House Home, a direct-to-consumer brand that sells a wear-it-anywhere nightgown called the Nap Dress and was valued in 2022 at $150 million. Audrey Gelman, who founded the women\u2019s club the Wing, which collapsed in a storm of controversy, now runs a small store of midwestern-ish antiques called Six Bells in Cobble Hill, opened in 2022 (and just ten minutes away from Salter House).\n\nAlison Roman, who was also the subject of the pandemic-era slate of cancellations after she denigrated Chrissy Teigen\u2019s business strategy, now runs a pantry provisions store in Upstate New York. Laila Gohar, a New York-based entrepreneur who has made food into performance art, launched a William Sonoma-by-way-of-Salvador-Dali shop called Gohar World in 2020 with her sister, selling candles shaped like fried chicken and little lace aprons for champagne bottles.\n\nYou have to wonder whether, after seeing so many female entrepreneurs get publicly burned, women see the safest space as the one they can control completely \u2014 the home. It isn\u2019t only New Yorkers who have been fixated at the hearth, as it were: the Tradwife has taken over social media as women find new meaning in old-fashioned gender roles.\n\nGore sees this as a reflection of the country\u2019s sociopolitical climate: \u201cIn general, more people are craving simple comforts that are often associated with rustic settings so there\u2019s been quite an uptick of interest in antiques, wicker and rattan furniture, quilts, baskets, brooms, heirlooms, etc.\u201d\n\nWhen I ask if Sandeep has Stewart-level ambitions, she laughs. \u201cHow big do I want this to be? I think that\u2019s a question I haven\u2019t answered myself yet. I\u2019ve already kind of got everything I wanted and I like I feel really secure in what we\u2019ve done, and if we can continue to do that and it grows, fantastic. If it stays like this for 50 years, I will be delighted.\u201d She\u2019s been approached by various businesses to collaborate \u2014 she declines to name them, though says they\u2019re similar to Anthropologie \u2014 but turns them down, preferring to work with artists. The Loeffler Randall collection was a rare exception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if she isn\u2019t Stewart, she is the ideal to which so many women in their thirties and forties aspire: a beautiful and tasteful come, a lovely family and a business that is creative and successful, original. Other women seem in awe of Sandeep. \u201cHonest, authentic, genuine, substantial,\u201d Alyeshmerni describes Salter. \u201cShe\u2019s very, very glamorous,\u201d says Fiona Duncan, an author and curator staging an exhibition at Picture Room this month. \u201cShe has such clear convictions about things,\u201d says Avillez. They speak in awe of her twinned ambition and commitment to her family; Alyeshmerni says the store is like an extension of her home.\n\nHaving recently had a child herself, Avillez says, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that they had two kids and then they were creating all these businesses.\u201d\n\nFor Sandeep, the cultural turn toward the home is a positive one. \u201cI think that a culture that values its domestic life is healthy. One would hope that also there\u2019s kind of a humanist aspect to that \u2014 that it\u2019s about nurturing your family and the people that inhabit the home. And I do really believe that if you\u2019re able to fill your home with things that are well-made and that you love and have an investment in the materials or the way it\u2019s been made, then it can make you feel really happy.\u201d\n\nPart of what makes Sandeep\u2019s store unique is her artistic approach \u2014 retail as theater, as art practice. She began exploring this idea when she worked with the influential bookseller, Sarah McNally, to open Goods for the Study and Picture Room, as adjacent offerings to the McNally Jackson bookstore in 2013 and 2014, respectively. (She later moved Picture Room independently to its current location.)\n\nAs much as the store is a place to celebrate objects, she also wants it to be a place to discuss their lineage \u2014 the patterns and colors often drawn from Indian silk paintings that fill their home. \u201cThis is an Indian-style placket,\u201d she says, gesturing to the buttons on her dress with her Parmigianino-like fingers. Wearing bloomers with a dress as a pajama suit, something of a Salter House signature look, is an idea derived from Indian dress.\n\nOne of the strangest things about cottagecore is that so much of English country aesthetics derive from India \u2014 floral prints, silk textiles, afternoon tea. \u201cI think I am that history,\u201d Sandeep says. \u201cI am a mixed race person who grew up in England, from immigrants. That is literally my history. So being able to pass that and work through it through aesthetics is really important. I think that, yes, floral designs and cottagecore aesthetics are absolutely a trickle down of colonialism. And I want to make sure that people understand that \u2014 that floral patterning comes from Rajasthan, it\u2019s not something that was a Georgian innovation.\u201d"}

Roberts Jr. But the case, Trump v. Anderson, also puts the country\u2019s sixth chief justice, Salmon P. Chase, in the judicial spotlight. Whatever happens, Chase\u2019s unlikely moment of prominence contains a historical lesson about the link between law and politics.\n\nThose following the Trump disqualification case closely know that Chase, appointed to the Supreme Court by President Abraham Lincoln in 1864, wrote the main judicial opinion on the 14th Amendment\u2019s disqualification clause. Ratified in 1868, the amendment barred officeholders who \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d from future office. Chase \u2014 as a lone justice \u201criding circuit\u201d \u2014 ruled in an 1869 opinion known as \u201cGriffin\u2019s Case\u201d that it would be infeasible to determine \u201cwhat particular individuals are embraced\u201d by the disqualification clause without a legal process prescribed by Congress. The next year, Congress passed legislation creating such a process.\n\nFast forward to 2024. There is a campaign to disqualify Trump from the presidency on the grounds that the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot was an insurrection. Congress has said that those convicted of insurrection are disqualified from office under the 14th Amendment. But the Justice Department hasn\u2019t even charged Trump with that crime. Trump\u2019s opponents argue that states can or must remove him from ballots anyway, as Colorado has done.\n\nLincoln\u2019s chief justice is standing in the way. For the disqualification campaign to succeed, Trump\u2019s opponents must overcome Chase\u2019s seminal 1869 Griffin opinion. If Chase was a reliable authority on the 14th Amendment, then the activist end run around convicting Trump with insurrection is dubious at best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes some audacity to so confidently dismiss Chase\u2019s reading of what the 14th Amendment required in 1868; after all, he was there. Yet that\u2019s precisely what activists and academics are doing. The law review article by professors William Baude and Michael Stokes Paulsen that turbocharged the disqualification campaign against Trump calls Chase\u2019s view \u201cappalling\u201d and says it should be \u201chooted down from the pages of history,\u201d a reference to the infamous 1857 Supreme Court opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford.\n\nThe Baude and Paulsen article is cited by the Colorado Supreme Court and throughout the U.S. Supreme Court briefs in Anderson v. Trump. As law professors Josh Blackman and Seth B. Tillman observe, the case for disqualifying the leading Republican candidate rests in part on impugning Chase\u2019s motives \u2014 arguing that his seemingly authoritative, contemporaneous judgment was distorted by political ambitions and policy preferences. \u201cChase harbored presidential ambitions in the late 1860s,\u201d one brief notes. A different law review article cited repeatedly in briefs suggests that Chase interpreted the disqualification clause incorrectly \u201cas a way of convincing skeptical whites to accept the text.\u201d\n\nFollow this author Jason Willick 's opinions Follow\n\nWho was this historical figure now at the center of the Trump ballot dispute? First and foremost, as historian Walter Stahr emphasizes in his 2022 biography, Chase was a giant of the antislavery movement in the pre-Civil War era. He was known as the \u201cattorney general for fugitive slaves\u201d for his antebellum efforts as a lawyer, and he helped lead the tiny Free Soil Party, founded in 1848. As Lincoln\u2019s treasury secretary during the Civil War, Chase represented the \u201cradical\u201d wing of the Cabinet with his support for full and prompt emancipation.\n\nAnd yet \u2014 as Stahr points out \u2014 Chase was a pragmatist, not a revolutionary. In contrast to abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison, who condemned the Constitution as a proslavery document, Chase read it as an expression of antislavery philosophy. He wanted antislavery politics channeled through existing institutions. This pragmatic approach triumphed in the democratic election of Lincoln and the north\u2019s Civil War victory.\n\nChase\u2019s postwar opinion in Griffin\u2019s Case might seem at first glance to go against his vehement Unionism. In fact, by declining a revolutionary reading of the 14th Amendment\u2019s disqualification clause, he was displaying the same pragmatic temperament he brought to the antislavery movement. He tried to harmonize 14th Amendment disqualification with the principle of due process the Constitution also embodies.\n\nIn 2024, the wisdom of this approach is coming into renewed focus. Allowing state officials to haphazardly disqualify opposing presidential candidates would invite a crisis of federalism and democratic legitimacy. Chase was biased toward readings of the Constitution that would preserve its overall coherence.\n\nCritics of Chase\u2019s jurisprudence rightly note that he was also a politician, having served as both governor and senator from Ohio \u2014 and having eyed the presidency not only in 1860 and 1864 but also after Lincoln appointed him to the Supreme Court. Chase\u2019s Griffin decision, however, came after his last best shot at a major-party nomination, in 1868, had passed. And Chase was not afraid to champion Reconstruction while he was politicking: One pathbreaking 1867 opinion by Chase blocked a Maryland effort to smuggle a slavery-like arrangement into \u201capprenticeship\u201d programs. Reconstruction did not collapse until after Chase\u2019s death in 1873.\n\nStahr quotes one of Chase\u2019s Supreme Court colleagues as writing in a letter that the chief justice \u201cnever allowed his political aspirations to warp his judicial conduct,\u201d but allowed that \u201cit was impossible to suppress the suspicion in some minds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether that suspicion was true or not, however, is next to irrelevant today. Law is a creation of human beings who operate within political systems. The Federalist Papers were partisan pamphlets written by men \u2014 James Madison, John Jay and Alexander Hamilton \u2014 with ambitions for high office in the early republic. That doesn\u2019t make their essays any less instructive in debates about the original Constitution\u2019s purpose and meaning. Chase similarly helped promote the ratification of the post-Civil War amendments. His Griffin opinion, whether influenced by politics or not, illustrates an entirely plausible interpretation of the 14th.\n\nHistorian C. Ellen Connally wrote in 2015 that Chase \u201csteered the Supreme Court on a prudent and realistic course. He was well aware that the Republican-dominated Congress would take any opportunity to threaten the independence of the Court.\u201d Historians of the current Supreme Court will observe that Roberts was acutely aware of similar concerns, and the chief justice might not take kindly to the partisan assault on his 19th-century predecessor. Newly minted critics of Chase are positing a radical separation between law and the political context in which it arose and developed. They are also indirectly attacking Roberts\u2019s own brand of pragmatic judicial statesmanship."}

Those ingredients have turned off some consumers and sparked concerns about the highly processed nature of the average veggie burger or faux slice of bacon.\n\nBut now, a few start-ups are planning on adding one more component to the mix: animal fat. Some companies are growing fat in laboratories, hoping to combine it with wheat protein and spices to make an extra porky form of plant-based bacon. Others are pulling animal byproducts from traditional meat production and blending it with plant ingredients to create pieces of shredded steak.\n\nThe change could alter the identity of plant-based meats, which have been largely seen as an option for vegans and vegetarians. But proponents see that as a feature: a tasty way to propel plant-based meats away from the small proportion of consumers who don\u2019t eat meat and into the mainstream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally difficult to make plants taste like meat,\u201d said Saba Fazeli, co-founder of the start-up Choppy, formerly known as Paul\u2019s Table, which is incorporating fat into plant-based meat. \u201cI would say it\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\nWhy plant meats have struggled\n\nIn the late 2010s, plant-based meats looked poised to take over the world. Beyond Meat \u2014 which produces a plant-based burger colored red by beet juice \u2014 saw its stock rise to over $200 per share in 2019.\n\nBut after the first year of the coronavirus pandemic, the market slumped. In 2022, unit sales of plant-based meats in the United States fell by 8 percent from the previous year; plant-based companies that were former Wall Street darlings saw their stock prices plummet.\n\nFood analysts say the flavors of plant-based meats aren\u2019t yet up to par \u2014 and while meat-eating accounts for approximately 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, most consumers aren\u2019t making choices based on sustainability so much as on cost and flavor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile people do want to change the world and want to live sustainable lives, ultimately, at the end of the day, people only want to do that when they\u2019re able to eat the products that taste really good,\u201d said Ed Steele, co-founder of the London-based cultivated fat start-up Hoxton Farms.\n\nThe need for fat\n\nThe solution, for some companies, is to incorporate one of the most flavorful components of real meat: fat.\n\n\u201cFat is just such an incredibly important part of the food sensory experience,\u201d said Priera Panescu, lead scientist for plant-based meats at the nonprofit Good Food Institute. Fat coats the tongue, causing flavors to linger much longer than they would otherwise. It also carries scents, helping to enhance the aroma of a freshly seared steak or roasted chicken breast. In one form or another, animal fat gives burgers their juice and pastries their flaky crusts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, the most commonly used fat alternative in plant-based meats is coconut oil. But while coconut oil is better than some other vegetable oils for plant-based meats, \u201cit\u2019s really nothing like animal fat,\u201d Panescu said. Coconut oil has a much lower melting point than animal fat \u2014 meaning that during cooking, it melts too early, giving plant-based meat a greasier texture. It also doesn\u2019t coat the mouth in the same way.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWithout fat, the taste of plant-based meat is \u201cincredibly disappointing,\u201d Steele said. His company is cultivating blobs of pork belly fat in a London lab \u2014 fat that could ultimately provide the juice of a plant-based meatball.\n\nIn California, the start-up Mission Barns has set out on a similar path: growing pork fat in the lab that can be added to plant-based bacon, meatballs or sausages. \u201cWe feel it\u2019s the biggest missing piece,\u201d said Eitan Fischer, the company\u2019s CEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompanies also claim that lab-grown fat has advantages over standard muscle tissue grown in the lab. Growing meat remains prohibitively expensive \u2014 while most companies do not publicly share their costs, lab-grown or \u201ccultivated\u201d meat is estimated to cost hundreds of dollars per pound. That\u2019s largely because the process involves a host of expensive, medical-grade equipment, from bioreactors to the soupy nutrients that are pumped in to feed the growing cells.\n\nLab-grown fat still requires some of that equipment, but it takes different, cheaper nutrients than standard muscle cells. \u201cNo expensive proteins \u2014 you just need very cheap sugars and very cheap oils,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a lot to convince a fat cell that it\u2019s time to store more energy.\u201d\n\nSome fat with your plants\n\nHybrid protein products have been around for a long time \u2014 large food companies like Perdue Farms have experimented with offering proteins that are mostly meat with some vegetable proteins blended in, sold under optimistic names like \u201cChicken Plus.\u201d But the new companies are flipping that process on its head: building products that are around 90 percent plant-based with just 10 percent fat blended in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat fat doesn\u2019t even have to be grown in a lab. Fazeli\u2019s company, Choppy, is adding byproducts of the meat industry \u2014 like fat, collagen and broth components \u2014 into plant-based products. For most vegetarians and vegans, that would make their products a no-go. But Fazeli and his co-founder, Brice Klein, aren\u2019t necessarily looking for vegetarian buyers.\n\nIn the plant-based meat space, \u201cwe\u2019ve been taking this kind of \u2018Field of Dreams,\u2019 \u2018build it and they will come\u2019 approach,\u201d Klein said. \u201cBillions of dollars have been poured into this space, and the number of people eating the product hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d Over the past 20 years, the percent of U.S. consumers who identify as vegetarians or vegans has remained relatively stable at less than 10 percent.\n\nBecause of that, Klein argues that trying to stay fully plant-based may be a waste of time. \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in that mass market audience,\u201d he said. Their prepackaged plant-based products \u2014 with fat added in \u2014 are sold at some grocery stores in California and Utah. Most of the cultivated fat companies are still waiting for Food and Drug Administration approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill these new products work? It\u2019s hard to say. Some of the problems with plant-based meats \u2014 consumer suspicion over long ingredient lists, high processing and higher costs \u2014 may carry over into the new blended foods. The food industry has yet to prove that any meat alternative can take a decisive chunk out of the market for chicken, pork and beef."}

She carries a pocket Constitution in her purse. She has another copy, slightly larger with images of the Founding Fathers on the cover, that she leaves on a table in her sitting room so she can consult it when she watches TV.\n\nShe\u2019s turned down a page corner in that copy to mark the spot where the 14th Amendment appears. She has reread it several times since joining a lawsuit last year that cites the amendment in seeking to stop Donald Trump from running for president.\n\nAnderson, 91, is the unlikely face of a challenge to Trump\u2019s campaign that will be heard by the Supreme Court on Thursday. She was a force in Colorado politics for decades, serving as the first female majority leader in both chambers of the legislature. She is a Republican but has long been skeptical of Trump and believes he is an insurrectionist who crossed a verboten line on Jan. 6, 2021, that should bar him from holding office again.\n\n(Video: TWP)\n\n\u201cHe tried to overturn an election,\u201d she said. \u201cThe very first time I ever ran, I didn\u2019t win. I didn\u2019t go out and try to change the election. I said, \u2018Whoops, work harder next time, lady.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe 2024 election could turn on whether the Supreme Court agrees with Anderson and five other Republican and independent voters who persuaded Colorado\u2019s top court to rule that Trump is ineligible to run again. The justices \u2014 three of whom were nominated by Trump \u2014 are expected to quickly decide the historic Trump v. Anderson case, with their ruling likely to apply across all 50 states.\n\nAlthough considered a legal long shot, a decision in Anderson\u2019s favor would jolt American politics by preventing the GOP front-runner from continuing his campaign. However the justices rule, they are likely to displease a large chunk of an intensely polarized electorate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case is built on the 14th Amendment, which was adopted three years after the end of the Civil War to guarantee rights for the formerly enslaved and to prevent former Confederates from returning to power. That latter provision, known as Section 3, is written broadly to say those who engage in insurrection after taking an oath to support the Constitution cannot hold office.\n\nAnderson\u2019s lawsuit, brought with the help of the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), argues Trump can\u2019t appear on Colorado\u2019s March 5 primary ballot because he engaged in insurrection before and during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Colorado\u2019s high court agreed in a 4-3 ruling in December, and Trump appealed the case to the Supreme Court.\n\nSection 3 was dormant for more than a century but received new attention after Jan. 6. CREW spearheaded a lawsuit in 2022 that bounced a county commissioner in New Mexico out of office because of his role in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe debates over whether Section 3 can block Trump from office have not always followed clean ideological lines. Some prominent conservative scholars have contended Trump should be deemed ineligible for office, even as some liberals have argued the best way to shore up democracy is to defeat Trump at the ballot box.\n\nPolls show the country is split on whether Trump should be disqualified. The former president has called the attempts in Colorado and other states to remove him from the ballot an anti-democratic attempt to interfere with the election.\n\nBefore attorney Mario Nicolais approached Norma Anderson to be part of the lawsuit seeking to bar Trump from the ballot, he asked Pam Anderson, the 2022 Republican nominee for Colorado secretary of state. She decided not to do it but suggested Nicolais try her mother-in-law. Nicolais, a research analyst for Rudy Giuliani\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign who is now working with CREW, was thrilled to learn a Republican luminary might consider signing on and called Norma Anderson. She agreed on the spot.\n\n\u201cThe short answer was \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d Nicolais said. \u201cAnd the long answer was \u2018Hell yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso signing on to the suit were a former Republican member of Congress from Rhode Island who now lives in Colorado; a teacher; a former deputy chief of staff to a Republican governor; a former executive director of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Larimer County; and a conservative columnist for the Denver Post.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung called CREW a \u201cfront group\u201d for Democrats that is using plaintiffs who are RINOs \u2014 Republicans in name only \u2014 to give themselves political cover. In a written statement, he noted legal efforts to kick Trump off the primary ballot in other states have failed. \u201cWe believe a fair ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States will keep President Trump on the ballot and allow the American people to re-elect him to the White House,\u201d Cheung said.\n\nRaised a Republican, Anderson said she was attracted to the party\u2019s belief in fiscal restraint, personal responsibility and a strong national defense. She hosted a reception for Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona years before he became the 1964 Republican nominee for president. She oversaw Republican caucuses as a party committeewoman. And she knocked on doors to help GOP candidates long before mounting campaigns of her own.\n\nShe won a seat in the Colorado House in 1986, four years after losing her first bid. Her status as the first female majority leader means less to her, she said in an interview in her suburban Denver home, than what she considers her legislative accomplishments \u2014 creating the Colorado Transportation Department, rewriting the state\u2019s school funding system and establishing a visiting nurse program.\n\nDuring her tenure in the legislature, Anderson was considered a conservative who could work with others but knew how to get her way, said Dick Wadhams, a political consultant and former chairman of the Colorado Republican Party.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cOnce she decided where she was on an issue, she stuck to that,\u201d he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t waver. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why she was so popular at the time with Republicans, because she was strong. Nobody pushed Norma around.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Beasley, who worked with Anderson when he was the chief lobbyist for Gov. Bill Owens (R), said he had \u201cwatched her bring in the biggest bullies in politics and lock that door in her office and say, \u2018Here\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be, boys. We\u2019re going to work this out. We\u2019re going to figure it out.\u2019 And 9 out of 10 times she got her way 100 percent.\u201d\n\nAnderson surprised her colleagues when she abruptly quit the state Senate in 2006, a year before her term was up. She stayed active in politics but began to have reservations about a party that she believed was focusing too much on people\u2019s personal lives.\n\nWhen Trump was the party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2016 and 2020, she voted for third-party candidates. She quit the Republican Party in 2018 because of Trump but rejoined it in 2021. \u201cI thought, you know, I\u2019m the Republican. They aren\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said her Republican friends have supported her decision to join the lawsuit. \u201cThere\u2019s other Republicans that think I\u2019m a RINO,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\n\nAnderson said she knew she could face harassment when she signed up for the lawsuit but would not be deterred. \u201cI don\u2019t frighten very easily,\u201d she said.\n\nKrista Kafer, a Denver Post columnist who is another plaintiff, studied up on the case, prayed about it and consulted with her mother before deciding to join the lawsuit. She said she did so in part because she would want Democrats to do the same if a leader of their party did what Trump did after losing an election. And if Trump isn\u2019t barred from running, she said, future presidents may incite violence if they lose their reelection bids.\n\n\u201cOnly this time it\u2019s not going to be, you know, a guy with Viking horns and a bunch of people with poles and makeshift weapons,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this becomes the new normal, what does the next one look like? Bigger crowd, better weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriends have been supportive, but some acquaintances have cut ties with her because of the lawsuit, she said. A neighbor told her she was worried she would go to hell. Others have taken to social media to label her, variously, a Nazi, a communist, a Satanist and a RINO.\n\nKafer left the Republican Party when Trump became the nominee in 2016 and voted for a third-party candidate that year. In 2020, she said, she reluctantly voted for Trump, figuring he was better than Joe Biden. She said she was horrified when Trump refused to concede and relentlessly repeated lies about the election that fueled the attack on the Capitol.\n\n(Video: TWP)\n\nPart of what brought her back to the Republican Party during Trump\u2019s time in office was his appointment of conservatives to the bench. She said she thought Democrats treated Brett M. Kavanaugh unfairly when they considered his nomination to the Supreme Court by focusing on allegations, which he strenuously denied, that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.\n\nNow, Kavanaugh will be among the justices hearing the case about Trump\u2019s future, as will the other two Trump nominees, Neil M. Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. Kafer is not worried they\u2019ll be swayed by who nominated them, saying she views the justices as fair brokers.\n\n\u201cThey love the Constitution and they love the country, and they also know they\u2019re under a microscope,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything that\u2019s human is flawed, but the Supreme Court seems to me to be the most functional part of our system right now in that you don\u2019t see them bad-mouth each other. They don\u2019t tweet.\u201d\n\nAnother justice, Clarence Thomas, has faced calls to recuse himself from cases involving Trump because his wife, Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, urged the Trump White House and lawmakers to overturn the election.\n\nAnderson said she understood she might lose the case, but believed that bringing the lawsuit was worth it regardless."}

It\u2019s rife with mathematical formulas employing numbers and Greek letters that may as well be Sanskrit. But of all the conclusions their research could have landed upon, they mentioned one in completely decipherable English that surprised me:\n\n\u201cWashington should beware that releasing current quarterback Kirk Cousins (who is definitely NFL-ready),\u201d they surmised, \u201cin favor of incoming Oklahoma State phenomenon Mason Rudolph might be costly.\u201d\n\nNow, had there been bumper stickers in 2017 like the ones in the 1970s that showed support for one Washington quarterback over another \u2014 I Like Sonny (Jurgensen) or I Like Billy (Kilmer) \u2014 I would not have sported Cousins\u2019s name on the back of my whip. In hindsight, I was wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Cousins left after that 2017 season, at least a dozen guys have tried their hand at the game\u2019s most important position for Washington. All have been sacked, either felled by injury, as was the case with Cousins\u2019s immediate replacement, Alex Smith, or ineffectiveness.\n\nIn recently departed coach Ron Rivera\u2019s four seasons alone, nine guys started at quarterback. They combined to lose 40 of 67 games and never had a winning campaign. Whatever happened to Garrett Gilbert, anyway?\n\nSo I don\u2019t care much about who the coach is. It doesn\u2019t seem to be the most important hire at this moment. Whether the next sideline boss was to be the latest hotshot, Detroit offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, who decided otherwise, or a legend, Bill Belichick, who apparently didn\u2019t excite enough of the new stewards at team headquarters in Ashburn, so what? That it will be Dan Quinn may be uninspiring, but he won\u2019t make the ultimate difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is most critical is to get a franchise quarterback. Johnson, with a rejuvenated Jared Goff, considered being the offensive coordinator of the up-and-coming Lions a lot more attractive than being the head coach of a down-and-out club here. After all, teams that start the fewest quarterbacks over time win the most games, advance to the most Super Bowls and, as an extension, have the fewest head coaches. So which comes first? The quarterback or the coach? What made Hall of Fame Washington coach Joe Gibbs so extraordinary was that he bucked that truth by winning the Super Bowl with three different quarterbacks. But Gibbs isn\u2019t coming back again, nor should he.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nSnagging a franchise quarterback is not guaranteed. But this draft, according to the analysts, seems to add a little more luck to the process \u2014 particularly for Washington, which has the second pick.\n\nLast year\u2019s No. 2 selection was Ohio State quarterback C.J. Stroud, who was named to the Pro Bowl after he steered the Houston Texans to the playoffs. In 2021, the second pick was New York Jets quarterback Zach Wilson from BYU. The closest he will get to the Pro Bowl is with a ticket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, there was what turned out to be a quarterback mother lode with Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, Justin Herbert and Jordan Love picked in the first round and Jalen Hurts taken in the second. Burrow and Hurts have played in the Super Bowl. The others have guided their teams to the playoffs.\n\nThe first three players expected to be drafted this spring are quarterbacks: Caleb Williams from Southern California and D.C.\u2019s Gonzaga College High, who won the Heisman Trophy in 2022; Drake Maye from North Carolina; and Jayden Daniels, who won the Heisman Trophy this past season at LSU.\n\nWashington\u2019s dream scenario is that the Chicago Bears somehow, someway don\u2019t use the first pick to nab Williams, dropping him into the lap of his hometown team after it added Kliff Kingsbury, who worked with Williams at USC last season, as Quinn\u2019s offensive coordinator. But Pro Football Focus has me just as excited about Maye and Daniels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf Maye, it says: \u201cMaye possesses ideal NFL arm talent. He can hit just about any throw asked of him at the pro level with velocity and ball placement. He still puts the ball in harm\u2019s way with more turnovers than you\u2019d like, but the magnitude of the good he can do as a passer far outweighs the bad.\u201d\n\nOf Daniels, it observes: \u201cDaniels is a good dual-threat quarterback who has a ton of yards from scrimmage. Last year, he focused on taking care of the ball and had one of the lowest turnover-worthy play rates in the nation. This year, he\u2019s focused on playing better under pressure while pushing the ball downfield more often \u2014 and he\u2019s done both at career-high levels. His growth in all areas is encouraging and shows that he could be a QB to invest in.\u201d\n\nAfter watching Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen and Hurts, I have become prejudiced toward the quarterback who can extend the play by running away from defenders and gain yards while avoiding injury. Robert Griffin III appeared to have been that player if not for the arrogance his great athleticism lent him and a coach who didn\u2019t protect him after he was hurt. Maybe Daniels can be that guy and the staff Quinn assembles will restrain him."}

What to know about causes and treatments.", "domain": "washingtonpost.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMI7UlAowt9F0", "text": "Q: I\u2019ve got hemorrhoids. What are they exactly? How can I avoid getting them again? A: Everyone has hemorrhoids. They are a normal part of our bodies: Hemorrhoids are simply cushions of veins along the top and bottom of the anal canal, a short tunnel connecting the rectum to the anus.\n\nThey never get any credit, but hemorrhoids are kind of the MVPs of that area: The cushions help buttress the anal canal from accidental leakage. Ever wondered how your body knows the difference between gas, solid or liquid? Scientists think it\u2019s those sensitive hemorrhoids that can detect when it\u2019s safe to give your flatus the all-clear.\n\nBut those veins can become engorged, and the tissue holding them in their rightful place can weaken. When this happens, we notice our hemorrhoids, and that\u2019s when we call them a problem. Symptoms can include itching, bleeding, a sense of fullness, an uncomfortable lump, inadvertent soiling and pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDecades ago, doctors thought constipation and a low-fiber diet were the prime reasons people got symptomatic hemorrhoids. But studies over the years have not proved this consistently. And a high-fiber diet doesn\u2019t clearly lower the risk of developing engorged hemorrhoids \u2014 though it is recommended as treatment. Meta-analyses have shown that increased fiber can improve hemorrhoid symptoms once you have them.\n\nToday, we think symptomatic hemorrhoids can be related to these factors \u2014 but it\u2019s a more complex relationship. They are more likely a result of straining and hard stools (which can certainly occur with constipation, though not always).\n\nSitting and pushing for prolonged periods of time \u2014 which tends to happen while scrolling through social media on the commode \u2014 can compromise the supportive tissue in our anal canals. While I think smartphones have aggravated this issue, our pre-TikTok ancestors were not immune: A 1989 study published in the Lancet found that those with hemorrhoids spent more time reading on the toilet than those without hemorrhoids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is why I frequently remind my patients that they have one job, and one job only, when they take a seat.\n\nIf your diet is rich in fiber but you\u2019re still straining, talk to a gastroenterologist to help address why \u2014 there may be an issue with the pelvic floor muscles that could be improved with physical therapy.\n\nWhat is the fastest way to heal a hemorrhoid?\n\nSwollen hemorrhoids usually resolve on their own within a few days. Just like with a cold, the key things are to control your symptoms and support your body during that time. The data on most over-the-counter remedies is overall fairly weak, so I\u2019d steer clear of any products with ingredients you\u2019ve never heard of promising a quick fix.\n\nHere\u2019s what I tell my patients to do immediately when they are experiencing pain from hemorrhoids:\n\nStart taking extra fiber . Fiber supplements like psyllium husk . Fiber supplements like psyllium husk cut the risk of hemorrhoidal bleeding by half. They usually come as a powder or capsule. A typical dose is anywhere from 10 grams to as high as 30 grams daily (often divided into a morning and evening dose). I find the powder easier for my patients to adjust on their own \u2014 see what effect a lower dose has on your stools and go up from there.\n\nUse a bidet . If you don\u2019t own one, use wet wipes instead of toilet paper. These are gentler on the anal region and less irritating. If you don\u2019t own one, use wet wipes instead of toilet paper.These are gentler on the anal region and less irritating.\n\nTry a topical cream with hydrocortisone twice a day, but don\u2019t use it for longer than one week . These creams are sold at any pharmacy and might relieve itching. But steroids like hydrocortisone can also weaken the fragile tissue around your anus, so they should be stopped after a week.\n\nTake a sitz bath . A sitz bath is nothing fancy \u2014 it\u2019s a term derived from the German Sitzbad, denoting a bath in which you sit. You can buy a portable bowl that nestles on your toilet seat or just have a seat in your bathtub for around 10 minutes. The warm water can decrease pressure in your anal canal and reduce inflammation. I tell my patients to try to do them two or three times a day.\n\nCall your doctor if you have a painful thrombosed hemorrhoid. When hemorrhoids transform from mildly irritating to a burning ring of fire, chances are they\u2019ve thrombosed, or become filled with a blood clot. While these do resolve on their own, if the pain is excruciating, getting . When hemorrhoids transform from mildly irritating to a burning ring of fire, chances are they\u2019ve thrombosed, or become filled with a blood clot. While these do resolve on their own, if the pain is excruciating, getting a quick procedure can resolve the symptoms in a hurry. You want to act fast, though. After 72 hours, there\u2019s less of a benefit to intervening.\n\nHow do I know what kind of hemorrhoid I have?\n\nIs your hemorrhoid internal (arising from inside the anal canal) or external (arising around the rim of the anus)? External hemorrhoids are often more bothersome, especially when you\u2019re sitting, while internal hemorrhoids are usually painless but can bleed a lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes the tissue tethering internal hemorrhoids can become so weak that they flop out of the anal canal. These prolapsed hemorrhoids might emerge to say hello only while straining during a bowel movement and then retreat upward on their own. Other times, people might have to gently push them back up the canal manually.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nDo hemorrhoids ever stop coming back?\n\nOnce you have engorged hemorrhoids, it\u2019s common to find they keep coming back. The odds of them haunting you depend on ongoing risk factors (are you still tweeting from the toilet?), the type of hemorrhoid and how you treated it. For example, people who get surgery for thrombosed external hemorrhoids have a much lower chance of them returning (about 6 percent) than those who don\u2019t (about 25 percent).\n\nAfter a hemorrhoid resolves, it leaves you a little memento of your time together: a flap of tissue called a skin tag. These are harmless but can be difficult to clean. Skin tags are easily irritated when rubbed by toilet paper or when they come in contact with fecal matter \u2014 yet another reason to join #teambidet.\n\nWhat procedures are done to treat hemorrhoids?\n\nIf your hemorrhoids aren\u2019t improving, talk to your provider about a possible procedure. Certain aspects of how we intervene upon hemorrhoids haven\u2019t changed in over two millennia. Greek physician Hippocrates wrote a treatise on hemorrhoids around the 4th century B.C. describing rudimentary forms of surgical and ligation techniques that we pretty much still use today. For instance, many prolapsed internal hemorrhoids do well with a simple outpatient technique called rubber-band ligation that doesn\u2019t involve surgery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re on a blood thinner, your doctor might recommend sclerotherapy, a quick outpatient procedure involving injection of a chemical solution into the base of the hemorrhoid that causes it to shrivel. Other interventions can be more complex and involve anesthesia, such as hemorrhoidectomy for severe prolapsed hemorrhoids.\n\nWhat I want my patients to know\n\nIt\u2019s hard to put a precise number on how many Americans suffer from symptomatic hemorrhoids, but it\u2019s likely at least 10 million, most of them men and women ages 45 to 65. Some studies have observed that hemorrhoids are more common among pregnant and postpartum women, although it\u2019s unclear whether this is due to hormonal changes or other factors. During colorectal cancer screening colonoscopies, gastroenterologists like myself find them in about 1 in 3 patients.\n\nAdvertisement"}

(Reuters) -Heavy rainfall and hurricane-force winds pounded much of California on Sunday, knocking out power for 900,000 customers and threatening serious floods as forecasters expect the storm to stall over major cities for the next day or two.\n\nThe storm is the second Pineapple Express weather system, or atmospheric river storm, to hit the state in the past week and arrived just as Los Angeles welcomed celebrities for the music industry's Grammy awards, where the red carpet was tented but other attendees were forced to slog through heavy rain in glitzy cocktail attire, some with only a handbag for an umbrella.\n\nThe severe conditions prompted the National Weather Service's (NWS) Bay Area office to issue a rare hurricane-force wind warning for Big Sur and nearby areas.\n\nThe rain canceled the final round of the professional golf tournament at Pebble Beach in Northern California's Monterey County. Because heavy rain was forecast for Monday, the PGA Tour ended the event after only three days, naming Wyndham Clark the winner.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in eight counties with a combined population of more than 20 million people, and flash flood warnings were issued for parts of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.\n\n\"This has the potential to be a historic storm, severe winds, thunderstorms, and even brief tornadoes,\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told a news conference.\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County were not only getting drenched but the storm was expected to stall or reverse course over some areas into Tuesday, creating severe risk of flooding and mudslides.\n\n\"The Monday evening commute is going to be a complete disaster to say the least.

As much as 6-12 inches are expected in the foothills and lower-elevation mountains.\n\nThe Los Angeles and Santa Barbara areas were both at high risk for excessive rainfall on Sunday and Monday, with forecasters anticipating \"near continuous rainfall\" for 48 hours.\n\nEvacuation orders were issued for some of those counties' residents, as well as people in the San Jose region, Ventura County and two areas of Los Angeles County that previously suffered wildfires, making the denuded terrain more vulnerable to mudslides.\n\n(Reporting by Maria Caspani and Scott DiSavino in New York, Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles, and Daniel Trotta in Carlsbad, California; Editing by Lisa Shumaker, Chizu Nomiyama, Nick Zieminski amd Raju Gopalakrishnan)"}

It faces some opposition from both left and right in Congress and may not even be taken up by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, after former President Donald Trump repeatedly criticized the idea.\n\nCurrently, there are 544,690 Dreamers receiving temporary protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program created in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat. While they also are granted work permits under DACA, their status in the United States has to be renewed every two years and the new Senate bill keeps them in limbo.\n\nBut there are thought to be as many as 2 million Dreamers in the United States when counting those who currently are not covered by DACA. New sign-ups under the program have been placed on hold by court challenges to the program.\n\n\"To say that it's disappointing and frustrating I think is an understatement,\" said Diana Pliego, whose parents brought her to the U.S. at the age of three in 1997. \"I've been waiting 26 years for Congress to pass a meaningful pathway.\"\n\nNow 29, Pliego recounted a lifetime of deportation fears and childhood poverty because of her family's illegal immigration status.\n\nShe qualified for protection from deportation under the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, went on to earn a college degree and now lives in a Washington suburb and works for the National Immigration Law Center. But her childhood fears of deportation linger.\n\n\"I'm always aware of a police presence,\" Pliego said. \"Even to this day when I am driving, I see (police) lights, I kind of panic a little bit.\"\n\n'OFF THE TABLE'\n\nRepublican Senator Thom Tillis, who was part of past immigration reform attempts, said he is sympathetic to the Dreamers plight. But the notion of helping them or other undocumented immigrants who have long lived in the U.S. has become \"toxic\" because of the mass migration at the southern border, he added.\n\n\"I think that's off the table for years now,\" Tillis said in an interview.\n\nU.S. law enforcement has arrested around 2 million immigrants in fiscal year 2023 amid a wave of global migration due to wars, natural disasters and persecution.\n\nImmigration ranks as the second-greatest worry for Americans, according a Reuters/Ipsos poll published last week. Some 17% of respondents said it was their top concern, a sharp increase from December.\n\nMany Republicans argue that any program granting new rights to people who immigrate illegally, including children who had no say in their arrivals, would simply encourage more chaos at the border.\n\nMeanwhile, the legality of the DACA's implementation is being challenged and the U.S. Supreme Court could ultimately decide its fate.\n\n\"Of all the undocumented, these are the most sympathetic and the most likely to be helped,\" Durbin said.\n\nMarielena Hincapie, distinguished immigration scholar at Cornell University Law School, held out hope for future action by Congress on behalf of Dreamers, especially if DACA appeared to be at risk. Such a \"crisis,\" she said, could create \"a legislative window\" for Dreamer legislation.\n\n\"For many years, there was always this quid pro quo: If you talk about increased enforcement and detention, you also have to talk about legalization\" for certain groups of immigrants, she said.\n\nEdwin Torres DeSantiago, a 30-year-old DACA recipient in Minneapolis, said it is infuriating but not surprising to see senators negotiate a border deal without Dreamers.\n\n\"We're not talking about 10,000 people,\" he said, speaking of the DACA population. \"We're talking about hundreds of thousands of people who are teachers, who are nurses, who are doctors, who are professionals.\"\n\nTorres came to the U.S. from El Salvador on a tourist visa at age eight to join his parents, who also lack permanent status. Today, he is vice president of a public relations firm.\n\nHe worries that the Supreme Court could undo DACA or that Trump, if re-elected, could further clamp down on immigrants. His family's \"Armageddon\" plan is to move to California because of its strong immigrant protections.\n\n(Reporting by Richard Cowan; additional reporting by Ted Hesson; Editing by Scott Malone and Daniel Wallis)"}

If no party wins an outright majority, then the one with the biggest share of assembly seats can form a coalition government.\n\nWHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE A SURE BET?\n\nMany experts agree that in Pakistan\u2019s political landscape today, there really seems to be only one top contender for the post of premier \u2014 Nawaz Sharif, a three-times former prime minister who has returned to the country and been absolved of past convictions.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nSharif came back last October after four years of self-imposed exile in London to avoid serving prison sentences. Within weeks of his return, his sentences were thrown out and his convictions overturned.\n\nHis archrival, former Prime Minister Imran Khan, a cricket hero turned Islamist politician who was ousted in April 2022, is behind bars and banned from contesting the vote.\n\nAnd although Khan has a significant grassroots following, it's the intensity of his downfall and the ease of Sharif\u2019s return that have led many to believe the outcome has been already decided.\n\nWHY DOES IT MATTER?\n\nNuclear-armed Pakistan is the fifth most populous country in the world and an unpredictable Western ally. It borders Afghanistan, China, India and Iran \u2014 a region rife with hostile boundaries and tense relations.\n\nFor the international community, a strong and stable Pakistani government means a better chance of containing any unrest, addressing economic challenges and stemming illegal migration.\n\nAnd though anything can happen on election day, both Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League and Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf have led lackluster campaigns over the past few weeks \u2014 something experts say only feeds into the general apathy among some 127 million eligible voters.\n\nThat could come back to haunt Pakistan's next government and set the stage for an even more intense brain drain and more political trouble ahead, as well as violent protests. And that in turn would only benefit Islamic militants.\n\nA GROWING BACKLASH AGAINST THE ELITE\n\nKhan\u2019s May 2023 arrest triggered destructive rampages on a scale unseen since the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Khan's supporters blamed the military for his demise and set about wrecking military buildings and property \u2014 a strong message of defiance in a country where the army wields huge influence.\n\nThe authorities responded with mass arrests, a crackdown on Khan\u2019s party, and the introduction of military trials for civilians. The clampdown appears to have broken some of that spirit, though a recent pre-election rally in the southern city of Karachi, where police were forced to disperse Khan's supporters with tear gas, showed that some were ready to fight for him.\n\nMilitary affairs scholar Ayesha Siddiqa warns of more instability as the anti-establishment sentiment grows. \u201cPeople are angry,\" Siddiqa said. \"The dislike of the army has increased tremendously, and it\u2019s more noticeable.\u201d\n\nTHE DANGERS OF DEJA VU AND APATHY\n\nA year ago, Khan was still a free man rallying for a comeback while Sharif, ousted in 2017 over corruption allegations and banned for life from holding public office, was in London, seemingly out of the picture.\n\nNow the tables have turned.

Both Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have significant support among Jewish settlers in the West Bank, which is among territories where Palestinians seek to establish an independent state.\n\nHowever, the Bank of Israel said Israeli banks must comply with the decision by the Biden administration.\n\n\"Evading such sanctions regimes can expose banks to significant risks, including compliance risks, money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism risks, legal risks, and reputation risks,\" the central bank said in a statement.\n\n\"Ensuring proper conduct and orderly activity of banks in Israel is essential for maintaining the orderly activity of the economy.\"\n\nHapoalim, one of Israel's two largest banks, said it respects international sanctions and will comply with any legal order - though it declined to discuss any specific cases.\n\nIts main rival, Leumi, declined comment. But Yinon Levi, one of the settlers under U.S. sanctions, told Israel's Kan radio that Leumi had frozen his private and business accounts, and overturned his attempt to transfer out money.\n\nLevy, according to the U.S. State Department, led a group of far-right settlers that assaulted Palestinian civilians, burned their fields and destroyed property - allegations he denied.\n\n\"I am not involved in any violent actions,\" he said, adding that he had never been investigated by Israeli authorities nor had any legal interaction with U.S. authorities.\n\nDavid Chai Chasdai, another of the settlers under sanctions, told an Israeli newspaper that his account in the Postal Bank had been frozen.\n\nThe Postal Bank declined to discuss any specific case, but said it is \"obliged to respect and comply with international legal sanctions and orders as required in the international financial system\".\n\nAccording to the State Department, Chasdai led a riot in which vehicles and buildings were set on fire and property damaged in the West Bank village of Huwara, resulting in the death of a Palestinian civilian. Reuters could not immediately reach Chasdai or his lawyers for a response to the allegation.\n\nIn a statement aired by Israel's Army Radio, Chasdai deplored the sanctions as \"a national disgrace of the highest order ..., taking place under a rightist government, just after the biggest massacre in the country's history\" - a reference to the Oct. 7 rampage by Hamas militants that sparked the Gaza war.\n\nThe sanctions follow the U.S. imposition of travel visa bans in December on people involved in West Bank violence.\n\nMost world powers deem the settlements illegal.\n\nBen-Gvir described the freezing of the settlers' bank accounts as a \"red line\", adding in a social media post: \"We greatly respect and appreciate our allies in the world, but we must not let anyone manage the State of Israel.\"\n\n(Reporting by Steven Scheer and Dan Williams; editing by Mark Heinrich)"}

It's somewhat more common among men than women.\n\nAs the Rochester team explained, surgery to remove the tumor is a necessary and potentially lifesaving procedure for the vast majority of cases. But surgery also has serious disruptive effects on a patient's bowel function and quality of life.\n\nHowever, in a growing minority of cases, patients are successfully avoiding these procedures, Fleming's group reports.\n\nLooking at outcomes for more than 175,000 rectal cancer patients recorded in a U.S. national cancer database, their study found more patients being directed to a \"watch-and-wait\" approach.\n\nSuch strategies are already common for other cancer types, such as prostate or breast cancers. Depending on factors such as the aggressiveness of the tumor and its response to chemotherapy, doctors may hold off on ordering surgery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat similar to the evolution of breast cancer care,\u201d Fleming explained in a university news release. \u201cPatients used to have very extensive mastectomies and resections, whereas now breast conservation is offered wherever feasible.\u201d\n\nLooking over the data, his team found that the number of patients deciding to forgo rectal cancer surgeries rose to 10% between 2006 and 2020.\n\nThese patients are, of course, subjected to attentive follow-up in lieu of surgery. That typically means checking in regularly with experienced oncologists for at least five years post-diagnosis.\n\nFleming's group stressed that in these scenarios, doctors want to achieve a balance between seeing patients often enough that they can spot signs of cancer regrowth early, but not too often, since that can overburden patients and health care systems.\n\nAt his Rochester clinic, \"we try to facilitate as much of their follow-up as possible, and coordinate with affiliate units to try and make it easier for patients to make it to appointments.\u201d\n\nStill, the \"watch-and-wait\" option to rectal cancer treatment hasn't yet gone mainstream, and clinical trials remain the only way most patients access this approach.\n\nFleming and his team were involved in one such trial, which found that \"half of the patients who opted to watch-and-wait were able to avoid surgery long-term,\" according to the news release. As well, those patients who initially tried watch-and-wait and did go on to receive surgery had no worse survival than patient who got surgery right away, the trial found.\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about rectal cancer and its treatment at the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\nSOURCE: University of Rochester, news release, Feb. 1, 2024"}

But hopes of his release had been fuelled by a recent thaw, including the freeing of Australian broadcaster Cheng Lei shortly before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Beijing in November.\n\nHe was the first Australian leader to go to Beijing since 2016, after relations had soured over Chinese telecoms company Huawei, espionage allegations, Australia's push to investigate the origins of COVID-19, and military tensions in East Asia.\n\nNow, analysts say, the drive to improve relations and boost trade in items such as Australian wine that were thwarted by punitive Chinese tariffs will be an important factor as Canberra considers its response.\n\n\"Yang's sentence is a speed bump - not large enough to bring the bus to a halt, so to speak,\" said Adam Ni, an independent political analyst and editor of the \"China Neican\" policy newsletter.\n\n\"The trend in the relationship is improving because both Beijing and Canberra have strong incentives for enhancing ties.\"\n\nAlbanese's government has taken credit for stabilising relations with Australia's largest trading partner, as China lifted most trade blocks imposed in a 2020 diplomatic dispute that cost A$20 billion in commodity and food exports.\n\nA quarter of Australia's export earnings come from China, more than the next three trade partners, the United States, South Korea and Japan, combined.\n\n'DISAGREE WHERE WE MUST'\n\nWong said there would be times when the two nations did not agree.\n\n\"We have said stabilisation means we cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, and we engage in the national interest,\" she told reporters on Monday. \"Clearly this is an occasion on which we disagree.\"\n\nStill, analysts say the sentencing serves as a reminder of how fraught any improvement in relations will prove even after both Albanese and Chinese President Xi Jinping affirmed the need to bolster ties.\n\n\"The Chinese decision proves the fragility of Australian efforts to stabilise relations with China.

Three sources said at least three other major Chinese state brokerages have taken a similar approach.\n\nA total return swap (TRS) is a financial derivative contract where one party agrees to pay or receive the total return of an underlying asset in exchange for a fixed or variable financing rate from the other party.\n\nIt has been a popular over the counter (OTC) cross-border derivative for Chinese onshore funds, especially hedge funds, to access offshore stock markets, effectively side-stepping restrictions on capital flows.\n\nThe restrictions could thwart domestic fund managers who were tapping TRS to short-sell offshore China stocks, such as China A50-related contracts, one source with direct knowledge of the curbs said. This will also allow brokers to limit overall exposure to derivatives, he said.\n\nCICC is among 10 major brokerages in China licensed to provide TRS services, and is a top player.\n\nCICC did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.\n\nThe measures come as China's stock market faces renewed pressure and plumbs multi-year lows.

The couple's two teenage children were held hostage until Nov. 25 when they were freed during a brief truce.\n\nMirroring the restraint of the families, who inspire huge public empathy, Netanyahu has mostly avoided overtly criticising them, although frustrations have mounted on both sides.\n\nProtests by relatives outside his house have irked Netanyahu. He lashed out during a Jan. 27 news conference that such actions \"only strengthen the demands of Hamas\".\n\nDuring the week-long truce in late November, Hamas freed more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages in exchange for Israel releasing about 240 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nSince then, the issue of what price Israel should pay to get the more than 100 remaining hostages back, and how to balance that goal against its other stated war objective, to destroy Hamas, has become increasingly polarising.\n\nNegotiations between Israel and Hamas on a ceasefire and hostage deal, mediated by Qatar and Egypt and backed by the United States, are ongoing but the outcome is uncertain.\n\nNetanyahu, who faces rifts within his fractious coalition over terms for a deal, said on Sunday Israel was not ready to accept any price for the hostages.\n\nPolls by the Truman Institute and the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) show a sharp left-right split on the issue.\n\nOn the left, support for a deal with Hamas involving concessions such as a ceasefire or prisoner release in exchange for the hostages is much higher, while on the right opposition to such a deal and support for continuing the war are stronger.\n\nPolitical scientist Tamar Hermann of the IDI said solidarity with the hostage families was blending with broader anti-government sentiment, partly rooted in a huge pre-war protest movement against Netanyahu's plan to overhaul the judiciary.\n\nKIBBUTZ FACTOR\n\nA large proportion of the Gaza captives come from kibbutzim, communities that have deep historical links with the political left. New or existing left-wing parties could be a natural fit for any hostage relatives who did decide to go into politics.\n\nAsked whether his party wanted to recruit any of them, Tomer Reznik, secretary-general of left-wing Meretz, said it was reorganising itself for the next election and part of this would be finding new candidates \"relevant to the current situation\".\n\nConversely, the hostage families are seen as opponents by some on the right, and especially on the ultra-nationalist far right, which has sway over Netanyahu because it is part of his fragile coalition. Two far-right ministers implacably opposed to a deal with Hamas could bring down his government at any moment.\n\nSome of Netanyahu's hard-right supporters in politics and media portray the hostage families as leftists abusing public sympathy to further their anti-government agenda, said political scientist Gideon Rahat of the Hebrew University.\n\nOne tactic, he said, was to amplify the voices of a tiny number of far-right hostage relatives who oppose any deal with Hamas, such as Eliyahu Libman, a settler from Kiryat Arba in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, whose son Elyakim is held hostage.\n\nLibman has argued that Israel must destroy Hamas, no matter the cost, so that no Israeli is harmed by it in future.\n\n\"My son is the most important thing in the world to me but the state of Israel is also the most important thing in the world to me,\" he said on Channel 13 TV.\n\n(Writing by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Mark Heinrich)"}

It\u2019s a dark, gut-wrenching love story, with a plotline that blurs reality and fantasy.\n\nAdam is an isolated, emotionally damaged gay man. He\u2019s struggling to come to terms with the death of his parents when he was 12, and to overcome the sense of outsider otherness he feels on account of his sexuality.\n\nView image in fullscreen Peter Tatchell on Equality Now march, 1992. Photograph: Courtesy Peter Tatchell\n\nThis inner turmoil shuts down his openness to relationships and leads him to rebuff the doorstep advances of Harry, a younger, seemingly more confident neighbour. Adam then enters a dreamworld of, what if?\n\nThe two men embark on a passionate affair, with the companionship, love and acceptance that Adam has so long craved \u2013 until it comes to a sudden, heartbreaking halt. The saving grace is Adam\u2019s parallel imagined conversation and closure with his deceased parents who, he finally realises, truly loved him. A not totally bleak ending after all.\n\nThe film\u2019s frank exploration of the often tense and troubled relations between many over-50 gay men and their parents rings true. It reflects the ignorance and prejudice of a less tolerant era and the lingering emotional damage this continues to inflict, even decades later, to the detriment of many (not all) contemporary relationships involving an older generation of gay men.\n\nThese men also lived through the trauma of the \u201cgay plague\u201d and mass deaths from HIV, prior to the first effective treatments in the mid-1990s. This gets a passing mention in conversations between Adam and his mother but that\u2019s all. There is no reference to the intensified police witch-hunts in the 1980s and 90s, which also left many gay men broken.\n\nOf course, no one film can cover all aspects of the gay experience. But as well as this brutally honest portrayal of anguish and pain, I wish there were more films like 120 Beats Per Minute\u2019s equally harrowing but ultimately uplifting portrayal of gay love and loss, set amid the backdrop of the fightback against Aids by Act Up-Paris.\n\nThere are still too few major movies about LGBTQs who have not been crushed by homophobia. I\u2019d love to see a dramatisation, or even a documentary, that tells the personal and political stories of the trailblazingly proud defiant activists of the 1970s Gay Liberation Front and OutRage! in the 1990s. It\u2019s long overdue!\n\n\u2018Needed hotter sex, more grit, less sanguine miserablism\u2019\n\nJason Okundaye\n\nView image in fullscreen Jason Okundaye with his father in 1998. Photograph: Courtesy of Jason Okundaye\n\nI can understand why many reported finishing All of Us Strangers in floods of tears, but I didn\u2019t feel the same \u2013 the film felt as if it kept trying to force emotion out of me. I would\u2019ve been a prime target for its emotional manipulations, too \u2013 I\u2019m gay with a dead parent and a lot of straight friends and conscious of the loneliness that may face me when they start families and our lives become out of step.\n\nAll of Us Strangers is a desperate plea against the loneliness and dysfunction queer men can experience at different stages of their life and for different reasons. I did find aspects relatable \u2013 Adam ages and finds himself still in a flat by himself, unsure about what family means, or what the future holds for him \u2013 it feels familiar. But plenty of it was too ham-fisted and cliched about the contours of gay men\u2019s lives.\n\nI often imagine conversations with my own ghost dad, who died before I confirmed my sexuality, and what the film does well is portray the grief that affects gay men who lost parents young. While others may wish their parents could see their wives and children, our grief is complicated by not being sure what our relationship with our parent would be if they truly knew us. But when Adam reveals his sexuality to his mother, her confusions about gay men and women marrying and the \u201cfalling tombstone disease\u201d felt too pedestrian and artless to really connect. Perhaps that\u2019s the point \u2013 these are ghosts, confined to the language and intellectual constraints of when they died, the tragedy is in their limitations \u2013 but I think it betrays more of a problem with the film relying on too much identification from its audience.\n\nEqually, the generational difference between Adam and Harry is expressed through dialogue about their different interpretations of \u201cgay\u201d and \u201cqueer\u201d \u2013 it feels like the most paint-by-numbers conversation you can write between two gay men of a different age. What about their sexual differences? Any naughtiness? Playfulness? Conflict? Revulsion? The chemistry of the actors means that even the most wooden script is affecting, but I feel that I relate most when Adam forgets how to control his breath while kissing.\n\nMy interpretation of Harry is that he died after being turned away from Adam\u2019s door and Adam had been interacting with his ghost the whole time. The supernatural tricks force Adam to confront what he seems to have avoided in his life \u2013 both a reckoning with grief, and intimacy. In this sense, as indicated by Adam\u2019s lesser sexual experience and comment of his fears to have sex for \u201cobvious reasons\u201d (Aids is all but named, which makes even attempted subtlety feel lobbed at you). Harry represents those gay men lost who survivors feel some guilt over not being able to save or comfort. Harry is an apparition of Adam\u2019s desire for intimacy, connection and pleasure, but I think hotter ghost sex, a bit more grit, and a bit less sanguine miserablism might have made it feel more real.\n\n\u2018It just hits different\u2019\n\nTim Lusher\n\nView image in fullscreen Tim Lusher in 1990. Photograph: Courtesy of Tim Lusher\n\nThe 1980s, when Adam was a child, and I was a teenager, were an extraordinary time in Britain \u2013 punk had given the 1970s a thorough kicking, barged aside the cultural gatekeepers and smashed open the doors for a fresh surge of youth spirit. In strutted the art and fashion students, instant pop stars with their adorable combination of fancy-dress hats, glitter-and-glue glamour, paperback-poetry pretentiousness and scrappy charm. I sat on outsized Habitat cushions in my village bedroom, which I\u2019d painted in contrasting browns and fitted out with Argos chrome-and-glass coffee tables, ferns, spotlamps and dimmer switches, listening on my Akai boombox to the spacey future-pop of Trevor Horn \u2013 who produced Frankie Goes to Hollywood\u2019s gorgeous The Power of Love, the track that aches at the heart of All of Us Strangers \u2013 and poring over the outlandish chronicles of London clubland in my beloved magazines Blitz, the Face and i-D.\n\nThe age was full of pretty faces but had an ugly aspect. The TV \u2013 there were only four channels until 1987 \u2013 told stories of a hideous, incurable illness and scared us half to death with doomy health adverts featuring tombstones and icebergs. (We also worried about nuclear war and rabies, but Aids was in with a bullet at No 1 on the panic chart.) The people on the TV \u2013 who you sinkingly realised were probably like you \u2013 were all sitcom stooges and cosy chatshow hosts (\u201cconfirmed bachelors\u201d), who understood just how far they could go with the sauce and still retain everyone\u2019s fragile tolerance before, as Adam\u2019s mother would say, people started avoiding them in WHSmith. They weren\u2019t relatable.\n\nYou knew only who you really knew \u2013 family, neighbours, school friends. You sat in the hallway at home and made phone calls to them \u2013 voice calls! Unwarned! \u2013 on a landline. There was no internet, no quick or easy way to connect with people outside your world, to hear about a life different from your own.\n\nI went to university and found a pamphlet about the dangers of sex in my pigeonhole (not a euphemism). I closed the door and ignored freshers week. A lot of people didn\u2019t, of course. They met, by chance or design, in real life. A friend remembers that bars had paper and pens so people could swap numbers and arrange a date. He followed a seven-step pick-up routine. (Pass someone cute, walk seven steps, look back and smile, walk another seven, turn again, and if he did as well, go back and talk.) A few people were fiercely, politically out but otherwise it was all rumour and you were as likely to spot a snow leopard.\n\nView image in fullscreen Andrew Scott and Claire Foy in All of Us Strangers. Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/Alamy\n\nIn that early-modern time, which must now sound needlessly perverse to younger people, before the internet, mobile phones and the endless availability of everyone, the world particularly favoured the bold and your physical presence in it. The back pages of magazines \u2013 printed, on paper, that you paid for or picked up in clubs \u2013 were full of wistful calls for people and moments that had disappeared through life\u2019s sliding doors. \u201cMonday 10am. November. Northern line. Me: brown hair, suit, umbrella. You: blond, leather jacket, black cap. We smiled but didn\u2019t speak. You got off at Goodge Street.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re connected and steely now. I saw All of Us Strangers with a film club of men around the age of Adam. I could hear sniffing around the cinema as young women who could have gone to see Mean Girls or Poor Things watched two men act out their love story; our row looked moved but dry-eyed when the lights came up. Love, longing, loneliness, fear, grief \u2013 same for all of us, just hits different.\n\n\u2018A theatrical schema of invented grief and alienation\u2019\n\nCaspar Salmon\n\nView image in fullscreen Caspar Salmon in 1978. Photograph: Courtesy of Caspar Salmon\n\nIt\u2019s the title that jars. Not the \u201cstrangers\u201d part, because after all this is a story of utmost alienation \u2013 but \u201call of us\u201d: who is the \u201cus\u201d in this deeply subjective film centred grimly, defiantly, on one character? Where is the collective, in this study of a man so shattered by loss that everybody else appears as an extension of his own psyche?\n\nYour appreciation of All of Us Strangers will depend wholesale on your ability to accept the varying degrees of artifice thrown at you in quick succession. Andrew Haigh asks the audience to suspend their disbelief and go along with him in one key aspect of the film \u2013 that is, in the way that the central character, Adam, is able to interact with the phantasmic figures of his dead parents. That much requires a fair bit of indulgence, since these characters are so thinly drawn and exist only to embody the love that Adam longs for \u2013 indeed, the way they respond with so much \u201cacceptance\u201d to his coming out is so painfully earnest that it all gets a bit Legz Akimbo.\n\nBut the film also asks for the same benevolence from its audience in understanding the character of Harry (Paul Mescal) as an extension of Adam\u2019s id and asks that we accept the artifice of the set-up whereby Adam, an educated fortysomething gay writer, finds himself totally alone and friendless in some hideous new-build in Stratford, like a 20-year-old Apprentice contestant. For this writer, that is too much to take, and it sets the whole enterprise tumbling down: what should be a beautifully woven fever-dream of loss and grief becomes, instead, a terminally fake concoction, whose every utterance feels contrived, unearned.\n\nIt\u2019s true that many queer men have untold difficulties to contend with \u2013 loneliness, substance addiction, their relationship to sex \u2013 but Adam and his dream figures speak only for him, a theatrical schema of invented grief and alienation, trapped in a cruelly inert, scarcely credible narrative prison.\n\n\u2018Being gay and looking for love in the 80s, you felt you were often on your own\u2019\n\nChris Smith\n\nView image in fullscreen Chris Smith and Peter Tatchell on an Anti Clause 28 march in 1988. Photograph: Rick Colls/Shutterstock\n\nThis is a remarkable, haunting film \u2013 beautifully directed and acted \u2013 and it takes me right back to all the intensity and struggle of being a young gay man in the 80s, fuelled further by a soundtrack of songs from the period. The exploration of the hesitancy of gay intimacy \u2013 with a partner and above all with parents \u2013 shows how far we have come since those days.\n\nIn the 80s being gay was to be outside the mainstream; you had to make your own life and loves; and there was a certain loneliness about your life that simply isn\u2019t true for many young gay people today. There were friends to share your life and thoughts with, of course, but there was still a core part of you that was more difficult to share. If you were really lucky your parents and siblings would be among those sharing friends. But the journey to get there was a difficult one.\n\nTelling your parents (\u201cMum, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you for a long time\u201d) was always a moment of trauma. I fear I compounded the problem, for myself, by telling the world at the same time. It could often be a journey of fear, loneliness, awkwardness, and then eventually it could resolve into acceptance: this is the journey Adam goes on in the film, his parents now as it were frozen in time.\n\nBut there\u2019s real intimacy in his parents\u2019 responses, and you even begin to glimpse something beyond acceptance that celebrates Adam\u2019s gayness and the relationship he has now found. Moving from acceptance to celebration is surely the journey we all hope for \u2013 and it\u2019s something that now happens (thank goodness) more frequently.\n\nView image in fullscreen Smith and Tatchell on the march. Photograph: Rick Colls/Shutterstock\n\nYou felt you were often on your own, being gay and looking for love in the 80s, and you sense that this was what Adam went through in the film as he was growing up. He goes through it all again with Harry. The security of love and support was what we all strove for, and it didn\u2019t necessarily come easily. The love and support Adam eventually receives from his parents, and the love and support from Harry, are deeply fulfilling for him. And the aching loneliness of loss can be set, rather beautifully, in the context of that fulfilment. Fulfilment, after all, is the goal. It\u2019s a wonderful, must-see movie.\n\n\u2018Mired in an almost exploitative need to have you weeping at every possible moment\u2019\n\nBarry Levitt\n\nView image in fullscreen Barry Levitt at Essex Pride in 2023. Photograph: Courtesy of Barry Levitt\n\nAll of Us Strangers tries to capture how isolating homosexuality, or indeed any queerness can be, even in a big city that in theory offers more opportunities for queer people than anywhere else. It mostly succeeds in this, but this film seems exclusively interested in gay despair. Haigh\u2019s film wants us to know that queerness and misery are intrinsically linked and lets us know this at every opportunity. Gorgeous, haunting cinematography and great performances can\u2019t make up for a script that hammers the same point ad nauseam.\n\nAdam and Harryare some of the saddest characters I can recall in movies, and while their performances impress, their chemistry together is sorely lacking. The film feels so dreamlike and detached from reality that the central relationship between Adam and Harry never feels genuine. It\u2019s as if the pair only desire each other because they\u2019re both desperately lonely and not because of anything they offer as people.\n\nI was surprised by how disconnected I felt throughout the entire film. There\u2019s a great story to be told here, but All of Us Strangers is mired in an almost exploitative need to have you weeping at every possible moment. As such, it forgets to flesh out its characters and give them the depth required to allow us to care about them. Adam and Harry often feel like avatars; characters with no definable characteristics outside of their loneliness and heartbreak.\n\nI found myself especially frustrated with All of Us Strangers since Haigh is such a brilliant director, and already achieved a stunning portrait of gay love and loneliness in 2011\u2019s Weekend. That\u2019s a film that had a lot more to say about being gay, while All of Us Strangers seems to plumb the depths of queer trauma, ultimately to no avail.\n\n\u2018Love and loss do not favour one generation over another\u2019\n\nMark O\u2019Connell\n\nView image in fullscreen Mark O\u2019Connell in 1987. Photograph: Courtesy of Mark O\u2019Connell\n\nThat floral beige kitchen, the Saturday shopping-centre burgers, the Aids ad headstones warning my parents how I might die, the fear that Holly Johnson will out me in my wicker-heavy lounge if I look at him and his leather-clad confidence on Top of the Pops \u2013 I too was that doughy, 12-year-old only-child \u201cpoof\u201d who could not throw a ball. Idle boomer bias wrapped in an Aids panic was quite the Home Counties starting pistol for a whole swath of us young Adams.\n\nDeath and difference were our flash-forwards. It is not just the dusty tinsel, hooped earrings and DayGlo knitwear of Haigh\u2019s queer opus that remind. The tough brilliance of All of Us Strangers is its familiar gut-punch for more than one generation of gay men forced to fear intimacy and love before they even hit their teens.\n\nAs the film\u2019s straight world confuses sexuality for identity, Adam is not a loner because he lost his parents at a young age. He is a loner because it matters that they never knew who he is. And Haigh\u2019s canny, almost ruthless flip of this is the haunted Harry. He is a loner because his parents do know who he is. Adam\u2019s parents and their mild, bridge-club phobias struggle to fathom how he could be both gay and happy. A possibly younger Harry-type glimpsed on a train with a bullish dad is already resigned to how his happy might already be out of reach. Almost 40 story years apart, both scenarios are two sides of the same queer experience coin. It stings because our differences are still reinforced. Haigh knows we just learn to get better navigating it.\n\nDespite the app-era of vending machine hook-ups, a whole swath of twentysomething Harrys are less able to walk through a park with a potential beau or spin drug-free and carefree in the red pillar playland that is the Royal Vauxhall Tavern. Adam is cautious of eventual sex and intimacy. Harry can only start a conversation by offering it to strangers. So, as that Frankie Goes to Hollywood star flickers bright over the end credits, that is why All of Us Strangers is a celestial movie force from above. Love and loss do not favour one generation over another."}

Salty.\n\nI don\u2019t know what Saltburn is. OK, we\u2019ll start at the beginning. Saltburn is a film written and directed by the Oscar-winning film-maker Emerald Fennell, about a young man who causes chaos when he\u2019s invited to stay at a stately home.\n\nWhat does this have to do with bath bombs? Ah, this is going to be difficult to explain if you haven\u2019t seen the film. Tell you what, it\u2019s streaming on Amazon at the moment. Go and watch it, then come back in about 50 minutes.\n\nIf you insist, but this doesn\u2019t seem like a particularly good use of my time \u2026 Oh my God. Right?\n\nWhat the hell did I just watch? Right? It gets a lot worse from there, but this is generally the point where people start to realise that Saltburn probably isn\u2019t going to be the sedate aristocratic drama they thought it was.\n\nHang on a minute \u2013 someone made a bath bomb of that? Yes, they did. Spoiler alert: someone made a bath bomb of the scene where Barry Keoghan watches Jacob Elordi masturbate in the bath, then sneaks in and licks the plughole.\n\nFor real? For real. Lush has just released Saltbomb, which it describes thus: \u201cLap it up, Saltbomb\u2019s salty, milky bath water is fit for a stately splurge \u2026 Sharing a fragrance with our all-year-round moisturising bubble bar, Milky Bath \u2026 [it leaves] the bather with silky smooth bath water they\u2019ll want to treasure every last drop of.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m going to be sick. Then definitely don\u2019t look at Etsy.\n\nWhy? It is absolutely teeming with Saltburn products, many of which come in the form of candles that smell like Elordi\u2019s bathwater.\n\nSo, bathwater plus \u2026 Yes, best not to dwell on it. Plus an enterprising Australian cocktail brand has just brought out its own Saltburn-inspired drink. It\u2019s gin, lychee martini and coconut milk, if you\u2019re interested.\n\nI\u2019m not interested, thank you very much. But how amazing is this? So many films would give their left leg to become the sort of all-encompassing pop culture phenomenon that Saltburn is now. Nobody made cocktails or bath bombs that had anything to do with, I don\u2019t know, Avatar 2.\n\nThat might be because Avatar 2 didn\u2019t include any scenes where a young man ruins the idea of baths for ever. Well, I guess there\u2019s always Avatar 3.\n\nDo say: \u201cSaltburn\u2019s weirdest moment is now immortalised as a hygiene product.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cI\u2019d rather wait for the official Saltburn soil dibber, thanks.\u201d"}

Sing it, though, and it might sound more familiar. That\u2019s thanks to a vocal trend that quietly took over popular music \u2013 and, 15 years after it was named, is still thriving.\n\nA tweet by a singer named Trackdroppa in 2009 dubbed it \u201ccursive singing\u201d, and it might be summed up like this: a vocalist adds extra vowel sounds to syllables, creating what are known as diphthongs, and leaves out consonants at the ends of some words. The effect can range from dreamy to playful, depending on the singer. Practitioners over the years have included Amy Winehouse, Halsey, Shawn Mendes and, if my own experience is anything to go by, virtually everyone at your local open mic night.\n\nExact definitions vary. Jamie Lynn Hart, a singer and teacher at Berklee College of Music in Boston, describes it as a combination of vocal fry \u2013 the gravelly tone perhaps most associated with Britney Spears \u2013 plus \u201celongated vowels and a slight change in the letter S\u201d. Aimee Nolte, a pianist, singer and YouTuber, associates the technique with \u201ca clenched jaw, without making very much space in your mouth\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s also been called \u201cindie girl voice\u201d, but there are plenty of non-indie, non-girls who do it, including Mendes, Justin Bieber and John Legend. Even Bob Dylan \u2013 not typically considered the most mellifluous vocalist \u2013 has used elements of cursive singing, according to the singer and YouTuber Yona Marie. \u201cIf there is an association with women, that ties to the case of what we know about innovation in language: it\u2019s that women tend to be the innovators,\u201d the linguist Bryan Gick told the CBC in November.\n\nIt isn\u2019t quite clear how it all began. \u201cI love to say as a teacher that it started with somebody who was probably pretty lazy in their diction, but happened to get a couple of hits under their belt,\u201d says Cassandre McKinley, a singer and associate professor at Berklee. Other singers heard it and loved it \u2013 \u201cand from there, things catch on like wildfire.\u201d\n\nLis Lewis, a vocal coach in Los Angeles whose clients include Miguel, Rihanna and Jack Black, sees the roots of cursive singing in R&B and gospel, in which syllables are often added to words so they better fit rhythms. As for odd pronunciations, she points out that singers and even actors often develop memorable ways of saying certain words so they\u2019ll stand out.\n\nPinpointing the exact origins, McKinley says, would require asking every cursive singer who their influences are. But vocal coaches and media investigations have pointed to Macy Gray, Corinne Bailey Rae and Amy Winehouse as pioneers of a sound that soon exploded internationally. Lorde helped popularize it, as did Adele early on, before her style shifted, Nolte says; then there was Halsey, Selena Gomez and more recently, Olivia Rodrigo. Tate McRae and Jessie Reyez have also been highlighted as cursive singers, while Vice has called the Australian musician Tones and I \u201cthe final boss\u201d of the style.\n\nHart says that whether her students are singing in cursive or channeling Christina Aguilera (who is not known for cursive singing), it\u2019s typically unconscious. After she posted an Instagram video parodying the trend, she says, a student commented: \u201cOh, my gosh, I just realized I\u2019m guilty of doing this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an understandable sentiment; no artist wants to feel they\u2019re simply mimicking others. On the other hand, is \u201cguilty\u201d the right word?\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that art moves through stylistic phases. Growing up listening to 90s radio, I took it for granted that all male rock frontmen just happened to have the same accent and broad baritone as Kurt Cobain: when you sing about \u201ceverything\u201d, you pronounce it \u201ceyavrayathaying\u201d, and that\u2019s all there is to it.\n\nPeople emulate their heroes. Hart\u2019s singer-songwriter students, influenced by bands like Mt Joy and the Lumineers, are often \u201ca little lazy with their pitch\u201d \u2013 a trend that can probably be traced back many decades to early Bob Dylan. And even when it sounds like everyone\u2019s doing the same thing, a style may be gradually progressing; after all, Rodrigo sounds nothing like Macy Gray, even if they both use elements of cursive.\n\nSo while simply following a trend may not be the peak of creativity, it makes perfect sense to, as Lewis puts it, \u201cgrow from a trend\u201d. When a singer listens to other musicians, \u201cthat\u2019s their research,\u201d Lewis says. They\u2019ll absorb it and then break out of it, expand on it or dump it, \u201cbut that\u2019s how art works, right?\u201d She doesn\u2019t see her students deliberately singing in cursive, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t discourage it if it was happening\u201d."}

Ofsted delivers the ratings as headlines, backed up by more detailed reports on performance in various areas, in its reports.\n\nLast month, an influential committee of MPs said the use of such judgments in Ofsted\u2019s reports on schools in England should end.

He died on Friday morning.\n\nHis hapless Pike frequently had run-ins with Cpt George Mainwaring, played by Arthur Lowe, and was looked after by Sgt Arthur Wilson, played by John Le Mesurier.\n\nView image in fullscreen Lavender, second from right, as Private Pike in Dad\u2019s Army alongside other members of the cast in 1970. Photograph: PA\n\nPike, the youngest member of the Home Guard troop and a bank clerk, would often refer to Wilson as Uncle Arthur because of his relationship with Pike\u2019s overprotective mother, Mavis, played by Janet Davies.\n\nLavender also played Derek Harkinson in EastEnders \u2013 initially from 2001 to 2005, then returning in 2016. He left the BBC soap in 2017 after he became ill with sepsis, having previously had cancer and a heart attack.\n\nIn the 1970s, Dad\u2019s Army regularly attracted more than 18 million viewers; becoming one of the most-watched television programmes of its time. In 2018, Royal Mail marked the show\u2019s 50th anniversary with a collection of stamps featuring the main characters.\n\nLavender once said it was the luckiest day of his life when he was cast as Pike. He was earning \u00a39 a week during a six-month stint at Canterbury Rep when someone came up to him and said he looked stupid enough to do it.\n\nHe said: \u201cI was a complete beginner and I suddenly joined what was probably Britain\u2019s most experienced team of character actors. I was in a state of shock finding myself suddenly among so many great actors. When the moment came for me to speak, that funny voice of Pike just came out in a moment of panic.\n\n\u201cSince then at the start of every new series it has been one hell of a job trying to conjure it up again. But Private Pike took me from obscurity into the TV big time. I could never have achieved that if I hadn\u2019t learned to say: \u2018Ooh Captain Mainwaring, my mum said even if the Germans come I mustn\u2019t catch cold.\u2019\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian in 2014, Lavender said Pike had also cost him film roles. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of Dad\u2019s Army. If you asked me: \u2018Would you like to be in a sitcom that was watched by 18 million people, was on screen for 10 years, and will create lots of work for you and provide not just for you but for your children for the next 40-odd years?\u2019 \u2013 which is what\u2019s happened \u2013 I\u2019d have been a fool to say \u2018bugger off\u2019. I\u2019d be a fool to have regrets.\u201d\n\nBut he added: \u201cI was close to getting two very big movies in the 70s. But, in the end, they said: \u2018We can\u2019t get past Private Pike\u2019 \u2026 Pike is why I was in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in rep at Worcester, rather than in the West End.\u201d\n\nDuring the same interview, Lavender cleared up a longstanding mystery from the show. When he had asked David Croft, one of the show\u2019s creators, if Uncle Arthur was Pike\u2019s father, Lavender was told: \u201cOf course.\u201d Speaking in 2014, he said: \u201cI never knew until then. I just said the lines.\u201d\n\nJon Petrie, the BBC\u2019s director of comedy, said: \u201cIan was a much-loved actor and will be sorely missed by all those who knew him. In his role of Private Pike, in Dad\u2019s Army, he delivered some of the most iconic and loved moments in the history of British comedy. Our thoughts are with his family.\u201d\n\nHe is survived by his wife, the choreographer and stage director Michelle Hardy, and their sons, Sam and Daniel."}

The feat was honoured with the Nobel prize in physics the following year.\n\nBut since the discovery of the Higgs boson, the collider has not revealed any significant new physics that might shed light on some of the deepest mysteries of the universe, such as the nature of dark matter or dark energy, why matter dominates over antimatter, and whether reality is permeated with hidden extra dimensions.\n\nCern drew up plans for the next machine, the Future Circular Collider (FCC), in 2019. The \u20ac20bn (\u00a317bn) machine would have a 90-100km circumference and aim to smash subatomic particles together at a maximum energy of 100 teraelectronvolts (TeV). The Large Hadron Collider achieves maximum energies of 14TeV.\n\nThe proposal has its critics, however. Sir David King, the UK\u2019s former government chief scientific adviser, told the BBC that spending billions on the machine would be \u201creckless\u201d when the world was facing such grave threats from the climate crisis.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Large Hadron Collider discovered the Higgs boson in 2012. Photograph: Cern/PA\n\nOn Friday, the Cern council discussed a midterm review of a feasibility study for the FCC. If the plans go ahead, the organisation would ask for approval in the next five years and hope to have the machine built and ready for operations in the 2040s when the LHC has completed its runs.\n\nProf Fabiola Gianotti, the director general of Cern, said: \u201cIf approved, the FCC would be the most powerful microscope ever built to study the laws of nature at the smallest scales and highest energies, with the goal of addressing some of the outstanding questions in today\u2019s fundamental physics and our understanding of the universe.\u201d\n\nTara Shears, a member of the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, and professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, said: \u201cThe science case is really exciting. At the moment we\u2019re carrying out a study to see if the machine is feasible. That should be finished in 2025, with a decision on the best way forward by 2028.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a next generation machine: bigger, faster, stronger, with the capability to reveal so much more detail about the fine details of the universe. It will reveal features of the Higgs and Higgs field that just can\u2019t be studied at the Large Hadron Collider, and let us look for dark matter and test new physics ideas in new regimes.\u201d\n\nIf the machine is approved it would be built in two stages. The first experiments would collide electrons together while the second phase, earmarked for the 2070s, would slam protons into one another. Because of the extra radiation generated by the machine, it would need to sit twice as far underground as the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nDr Sabine Hossenfelder at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy, said there was no evidence the FCC would reveal anything about dark matter or dark energy and was critical of the proposals.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the most likely thing such a machine would do is to just make better measurements of some constants in the standard model, and that\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not think that the societal relevance is high enough to justify such a big investment.\n\n\u201cI fear that funding such an experiment will mean that a lot of smart people will waste their time on research that will not lead to any progress. The LHC had a good motivation. The FCC has not. Particle physicists have to accept that their time is over. This is the age of quantum physics.\u201d\n\nProf Jon Butterworth, a member of the Atlas experiment at the Large Hadron Collider and a professor of physics at University College London, said the collider was a work in progress.\n\n\u201cThis is about extending the frontier of human knowledge into the heart of matter and the fundamental forces, in part to see how fundamental they really are,\u201d he added."}

It is like someone is putting your head underwater to drown, and then they pull your head up for a couple of seconds to take a breath, then push it underwater again. That is what we are going through, one bitter moment after another with a hint of positivity.\n\nWide awake, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking of all the tragedies we have been going through. It is like one of those TV shows that run for many seasons and then, when the writers are out of ideas, they come up with an illogical scenario just to kill some characters off, introduce new ones and add some \u201cspice\u201d to the series. It seems that the writers of my own show have gathered and thought to themselves: \u201cHow could we make his life more interesting?\u201d Someone jumped in and said: \u201cWell? What about we get him and his family displaced, with little food and other resources? What about putting everything he believes in to the test? Also, why only him? Why not write an event that would affect everyone around him?\u201d It seems that this storyline was approved by the production team and they went with it. All I hope for now is a couple of mundane episodes that could be easily skipped.\n\nOut of all the reasons why I couldn\u2019t sleep, severe cold was the strongest. No matter what I do, it goes directly to my bones. I remember a few days ago, how heavy the rain was. When I went out, the water was running in the street, creating a barrier. You could go deep into water almost up to your knees. All I wanted was to cross the few steps to reach the other side, but could not. So I decided to walk, hoping I will find a way across. I kept walking for a long time until I reached an area far away. I saw a guy I know on the other side trying to come into mine. We started screaming at each other.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t life funny?\u201d he said. \u201cI want to come into your side while you are trying to come into mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you remember those riddles about crossing the river?\u201d I yelled. \u201cIt seems that this is one of them.\u201d\n\nWe kept walking until we reached an area where the water level was low and some people have placed big rocks for others to step on to cross. When he finally reached my side, I asked him what he was doing.\n\n\u201cWell, some of our relatives are staying in a tent,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to go get them to stay with us until the rain is over.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you told me that you have seven families with you right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but we have no other option.\u201d\n\nI moved aside to let a man holding a child in his arms cross. I kept anxiously looking at him while he stepped over the rocks to the other side, hoping the child wouldn\u2019t fall. After he passed, I exchanged a few words with the guy and then crossed to the other side myself.\n\nView image in fullscreen There is flooding in Gaza due to heavy rainfall in the region. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images\n\n6am Manara, the cat we hosted months ago, is pregnant. Very pregnant. Her belly is big and she is sleeping a lot. Since she got pregnant, she started going out less. There is a small tree in the nearby land that she loves sitting under. I have noticed that she yearns for female energy, whether it is my sister\u2019s, the grandmother\u2019s, or the oldest granddaughter\u2019s. Once any one of them is in the room, she would go and sit in their lap. These days, she is eating less, yet more often, and she drinks a lot. In my culture, when a woman is pregnant and she gets prettier, it means she is having a girl, but if the situation is otherwise, it means she is having a boy. It seems that Manara will have lots of girls.\n\nEvery time Manara goes out, she comes back with another stray cat from the street. \u201cI wonder if she goes outside just to bring stray cats to our room,\u201d I said to my sister. \u201cIt is like she is telling them there is a place where there is food and a shelter.\u201d We feed them a little and then let them out.\n\nFinding food for the cats has become really difficult. The way we coordinate, search and call everyone to provide them with food seems irrational compared with the events we are going through. \u201cThose are first world problems,\u201d someone once told me. \u201cPeople cannot have food these days, and you think about animals!\u201d I know that, but those cats are our responsibility and feeding them is a priority.\n\nMy sister pointed out to a terrifying fact. Manara went to mate almost two months ago, which means that she might deliver her babies very soon \u2013 one thing I don\u2019t think we could handle well. When she wanted to mate, we did our best to keep her inside, we were afraid that the whole nightmare wouldn\u2019t end before she gives birth, and we were right. However, she kept meowing and nagging, nonstop, day and night, which led us, after almost two weeks, to let her out.\n\nI was walking in the street the other day when I saw a guy I knew. \u201cWhen we evacuated, my sister put our cat in a bag and ran with her,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all happened fast. She did not take clothes nor certificates. Only the cat.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cBut my sister isn\u2019t the craziest one in our family. My father is. He took the hens with him, the hens! Can you imagine that? We were screaming, running and he was collecting the hens to take with him. My family is out of this world.\u201d\n\nAfter a while, I asked him if they have food for the cat. He said: \u201cYes, we do feed it any food leftovers or tuna if available.\u201d He was talking while I put my hand upfront to shake his, ready to leave. When our hands shook, he continued talking and said. \u201cWe need to take care of the cat, she is blind.\u201d I did not say a word. He smiled, but I did not. There is so much misery in this world. So much misery.\n\nView image in fullscreen Children \u2013 and their cat \u2013 sheltering in a tent in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, on 27 January.

The women and children stay in one of the classrooms; over 60 persons share the room. He said they sleep so close to each other that they couldn\u2019t move. He and the men sleep downstairs in a tent.\n\n\u201cWhen we first got here, I stopped eating for almost a month,\u201d he told me. \u201cI did not want to have to use the toilet. There is a long wait to get into the toilet, and at the beginning the toilet was filthy. But now, the displaced people worked together to ensure it is hygienic all the time.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Global Dispatch Free newsletter Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the woman took one tomato and asked him to weigh it and tell her the price\n\nHe continued: \u201cSleeping in the tent during these cold times is awful. Everyone is sick. I had a mattress but gave it to my older brother who suffers from back pain. I put my head on the mattress while the rest of my body is off it.\u201d\n\nNext to us was a man selling some vegetables. A woman approached yet she was hesitant. In our culture, people buy vegetables and fruit in kilos. But the woman took one tomato and asked him to weigh it and tell her the price. Then she added another tomato and did the same. After telling her the price, she opened the small money carrier she had and looked atwhat she had inside. Then she said that she will take one tomato only. The guy I was talking to went and added three tomatoes, gave them to the woman and paid the seller.\n\n\u201cYou know what hurts the most?\u201d he said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe it. It is having to buy lemons. In our land we had many big trees of lemon. We never had to buy any. All the neighbours and friends would come to us to take them. It is true that we lost our homes and everything we have. But losing those trees has a deep effect on my soul. It is just too hard, too hard.\u201d\n\nHe said that for the first time in his life he thinks about leaving Gaza for ever. \u201cEven my mother is encouraging me to do so. She asked me, if we survive, to leave and never look back.\u201d\n\nWhen my friend came, I introduced them to each other. When he knew the guy has no mattress. He said: \u201cI think I could help. I know someone with an extra mattress.\u201d The guy, shyly, offered to wait till tomorrow to go and get it, but my friend said we should go immediately. The happiness I saw on the guy\u2019s face when he held the mattress was unbelievable.\n\nView image in fullscreen The weather has turned colder in Gaza, further increasing the suffering of Palestinians forced to shelter in tents. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images\n\n4pm I saw a woman I know \u2013 we are not very close, but we are both close friends with another person. The mutual friend has left Gaza and is staying in a foreign country with some family members. After sharing greetings, she asked if it is possible to take a photo together and send it to our friend. I hesitated at first, because I rarely take photos these days, in order, if we make it alive, not to have any reminder of them. I agreed, I put on a big smile and we took the photo. She said she will share it once she has access to internet.\n\nTwo hours later, I receive messages from our friend. She told me how happy she is with the photo and how amazing we looked, which I doubt. She told me that she had a dream about the both of us the other day, we were at our favourite restaurant and we were going through the menu that we have already memorised by heart. \u201cWe were very happy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe also shared that she spends a lot of time in the library. \u201cThere is nothing to do but watching the news and being worried for my loved ones. I go to the library and read. They have big libraries with lots of books, I am sure you would love it if you were here. But the people are not as sociable as we are. They don\u2019t speak a lot, they barely smile at you.\u201d\n\nSeeing her message brought tears to my eyes. I really miss her and all my friends.\n\n8pm I am sad, exhausted and frustrated. Minutes ago, my sister, Ahmad and I sat down and started sharing who, among the people we know, died recently. A friend\u2019s mother, another friend\u2019s brother and a third friend\u2019s sister. The angel of death is roaming the skies of Gaza, nonstop.\n\nIt is very hard when your friends are going through tough times, yet you cannot be there with them to share their sadness. We are too tired to express sadness. I just want to sit in silence and grieve; I want to do nothing and talk to no one.\n\nWe heard knocking on the door. The oldest granddaughter peeked through the door and asked: \u201cWould you like to play cards?\u201d\n\nI looked at her, and then said: \u201cSure, why not? Let\u2019s play cards.\u201d"}

There wasn\u2019t much in the way of surprises, unless you count Killer Mike\u2019s evening: even before he departed the Crytpto.com arena in handcuffs following an alleged battery incident, he had won three awards, no mean feat for a politically driven rapper knocking on 50 years old. Andr\u00e9 3000, guest artist on Killer Mike\u2019s best rap performance-winning track Scientists & Engineers, recently fretted: \u201cI\u2019m 48 years old. Not to say that age is a thing that dictates what you rap about, but in a way it does. What do you talk about \u2013 I gotta go get a colonoscopy?\u201d Killer Mike\u2019s success, with another in a string of deeply felt and socially conscious albums, is its own rebuttal \u2013 as is Victoria Mon\u00e9t becoming the oldest winner of best new artist at 34.\n\nBut elsewhere, the winners were pretty much as you might have expected. Women clearly dominated the awards: only one male artist, Jon Batiste, was nominated in the top three categories; the most striking performances on the night came from SZA, Joni Mitchell and Billie Eilish, the latter taking home her ninth Grammy at the age of 22; outside of the winners the biggest news stories were the unexpected appearances of C\u00e9line Dion, handing out the album of the year award and Tracy Chapman, who last released an album in 2008 and last performed in public nine years ago, duetting with Luke Combs.\n\nAll of this made for a marked difference from a few years ago. As recently as 2018 \u2013 when almost no women won in the top categories \u2013 the Recording Academy\u2019s then chairman Neil Portnow made a terrible and revealing choice of words when, while lamenting the \u201cbrick walls\u201d faced by women, shifted the blame to the female artists themselves, saying they needed \u201cto step up\u201d and make themselves known.\n\nBut then, this year\u2019s winners hardly smacked of special pleading. Taylor Swift\u2019s commercial domination of 2023 was almost total \u2013 as well as the Eras tour, she was streamed 26bn times on Spotify last year \u2013 while Miley Cyrus\u2019s Flowers, winner of song of the year, was 2023\u2019s biggest song. It is notable that a Black woman hasn\u2019t won album of the year this century \u2013 Jay-Z gently chided the Academy on stage for not doing enough to credit Black artists, including his wife \u2013 and SZA arguably deserved it for the triumphantly eclectic album US No 1 album SOS, but she still went home with three awards.\n\nView image in fullscreen SZA accepts the award for best R&B song for Snooze. Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nThe striking thing about the awards wasn\u2019t that Taylor Swift or SZA or Billie Eilish won \u2013 frankly, it would have been weird if they didn\u2019t \u2013 but the sheer breadth of female artists\u2019 domination. Paramore and Boygenius won in the traditionally male-dominated rock and alternative categories; Wet Leg unexpectedly scooped remix of the year, another traditionally male-dominated category, for their take on Depeche Mode\u2019s Wagging Tongue. Women triumphed in the fields of country (Lainey Wilson), musica urbana (Karol G), R&B (Coco Jones), African music (22-year-old South African Tyla) and pop-dance (Kylie Minogue), although if you were looking for a British success story, you could alight on the dance/electronic categories, where Fred Again won two awards.\n\n00:02:00 Grammys 2024: Taylor Swift makes history with best album award \u2013 video highlights\n\nWithout wishing to detract anything from his own undoubted abilities and evident hitmaking touch, you could even argue that Jack Antonoff\u2019s win for best producer was effectively female powered, given that virtually all his recent high-profile clients are women \u2013 Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey, Clairo, Lorde, Olivia Rodrigo, St Vincent, Florence + the Machine \u2013 and that Swift and Del Rey co-produced their nominated work with him this year. Under the circumstances, you can\u2019t really blame Phoebe Bridgers of Boygenius for bringing up Neil Portnow\u2019s line about female artists failing to \u201cstep up\u201d, with a hair-raising lack of diplomacy: \u201cTo him I\u2019d like to say \u2013 I know you\u2019re not dead yet, but when you are, I hope you rot in piss.\u201d"}

This year, it comes in the form of Simple Machines (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606), an opening weekend treat by Belgian choreographer Ugo Dehaes. His shtick is that it has become too expensive to employ dancers in his company Kwaad Bloed so he has followed the lead of big business and done away with them.\n\nJust as Amazon embraces automation and supermarkets use self-service tills to make us do their work, so Dehaes has created a robot corps de ballet and got his audiences to develop their moves. We sit around a table to watch these dancing robots, some like snakes, others crabs, with rubbery flesh or mounds of black hair.\n\nIn a wry commentary on our brave new world, they are clunky and malfunctioning. And yet, in a culminating Swan Lake sequence, in which synchronised metal arms swing down over skittering insect dancers, they also have a mesmerising mechanical beauty.\n\nView image in fullscreen Gothic romp \u2026 Sofie Krog\u2019s The House. Photograph: Jakob Eskildsen\n\nIt is a quirky delight, as is Envahisseurs (Invaders) (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606), a 25-minute miniature by Olivier Rannou for Compagnie Bak\u00e9lite. With his heavy eyes and pouting lip, the French performer looks like an alien squeezed uncomfortably into a human body as he plays out a table-top re-enactment of a 1950s UFO invasion. It is all briefcases, flying saucers and paranoia; very funny in its pyrotechnic invention and the landing of a jelly-like extraterrestrial.\n\nAlso playing with genre, albeit with less wit, is The House (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606), a teen-friendly puppet show by Denmark\u2019s Sofie Krog theatre. Set in a rickety mansion \u2013 all flapping curtains and interior shadows \u2013 it is a gothic romp involving a forged will, a resourceful dog and a series of axe attacks. So far so daft, but there are too few visual surprises to offset the story\u2019s silliness.\n\nAl Seed\u2019s Plinth (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606) has the opposite weakness and takes itself far too seriously. Operating in a narrow emotional range, it tries to say something important about the heroic male figure. Seed\u2019s neck flexes, his arms twitch and his ribs ripple in a wordless piece that suggests the fallen of the first world war and the warriors of antiquity. But unless you regard the precision of his performance as an end in itself, it goes to a lot of effort to say very little.\n\nView image in fullscreen Real rage \u2026 Ramesh Meyyappan in Last Rites.

Last Rites (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606) is a sumptuous collaboration between the Glasgow performer and George Mann, director of Bristol\u2019s Ad Infinitum. It describes a man\u2019s final parting with his late father, a personal ritual before the traditional Hindu funeral. That could have been sentimental, not least because of the delicacy of Meyyappan\u2019s performance, making you believe in every last fingertip of the dead man\u2019s body. But although the story is fiction, it is invested with a rage that can only be real.\n\nWashing the corpse is an act of tenderness but also a trigger for violent memories, of a son unable to communicate with a father who refused to learn sign language, of an education system that discriminated against him, of a 10-year estrangement, of a grandson cut off from the family line.\n\nWith a tremendous score by Akintayo Akinbode and sympathetic lighting by Ali Hunter on Katie Sykes\u2019s elemental set, it is a knotty mix of love and recrimination in which the personal and the political collide."}

Households were also enduring very high energy bills. BP will report its profits for 2023 on Tuesday.\n\nStuart also asked for advice from Kingham about winning the argument that UK oil production was \u201cgood\u201d and part of the net zero transition. Experts have repeatedly refuted arguments that new oil and gas production can increase UK energy security or lower prices.\n\nThe UK\u2019s oil and gas body granted 24 new drilling licences to BP and other companies last Wednesday, following 27 licences in October and with more to follow in the coming months. The chair of the UK\u2019s official climate advisers said in January that \u201cfurther licensing [is] inconsistent with climate goals\u201d. The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that any new fossil fuel developments were incompatible with reaching net zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\u201cDrilling for new North Sea oil will undermine the UK\u2019s climate commitments and won\u2019t ensure energy security, yet the minister cynically sought BP\u2019s help to try and \u2018win\u2019 the opposite argument,\u201d said Chris Garrard, of the campaigns and research organisation Culture Unstained, which made the FoI request.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more disturbing though, is that days after BP had announced record profits, he seems to assure BP that there are incentives and money to keep its polluting fossil fuels flowing, all while the public struggled to pay their energy bills,\u201d he said.\n\nThe documents released include a heavily redacted readout of a meeting between Stuart and Kingham on 17 February 2023. Stuart asked: \u201cWhere do you think we are in terms of having the right incentives in place to maximise recovery from [the] North Sea and keep making the case to win the argument why producing it in the UK is good, and is part of the net zero transition, to make sure we minimise our imports?\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThe money is there, making incentives and structures to allow it to flow.\u201d\n\nStuart also asked Kingham for information to use in making the argument for new North Sea production: \u201cWe will be using oil and gas and, if we don\u2019t do it ourselves, we will be spending that money elsewhere. Adding that up I would like a number saying do we really want to spend x billions relying on foreign imports.\u201d\n\nLarge sections of Kingham\u2019s responses are redacted, with government officials citing \u201ccommercially confidential information\u201d. But she said: \u201cIdeologically, you need to think where to do tax or incentives, because you won\u2019t get the investment.\u201d She also said BP was \u201cproud of [its] work and the jobs it creates and ever cleaner barrels\u201d, adding that the argument would be \u201camplified by some social media and ads\u201d.\n\nTessa Khan, at the campaign group Uplift, said: \u201cBP\u2019s got a nerve telling our government that the industry needs more tax breaks and subsidies or they won\u2019t invest, in the middle of a cost of living crisis driven by energy bills and when it\u2019s just announced $28bn in profit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really egregious, though, is the minister responding that \u2018the money is there\u2019 for profiteering oil giants at the same time as it\u2019s just cut off vital support to millions of households who literally can\u2019t afford to heat their homes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question at all about whose side this government is on.\u201d\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cMinister Stuart is absolutely right to be backing domestic oil and gas, as the UK will still be using oil and gas even when we reach net zero in 2050. It is good for our energy security, supports up to 200,000 jobs and has brought in \u00a3400bn in tax revenue to date [over the past 50 years] which has been used to help families with the cost of living and fund public services. The \u00a36bn raised by our energy profits levy on oil and gas producers alone helped us pay around half a typical household\u2019s energy bill last winter.\u201d\n\n\u201cMinisters will continue to meet with energy companies to encourage investment into the UK and end reliance on costly foreign imports of liquefied natural gas with higher emissions,\u201d she said.\n\nA spokesperson for BP said: \u201cBP is a major UK-headquartered company with plans to invest significantly in the UK\u2019s energy systems and transition. As such, we have regular meetings with government departments. This discussion focused on how the UK could continue to attract investment and maintain pace after the US Inflation Reduction Act in both today\u2019s oil and gas system and in renewable and low carbon projects.\u201d The act supports renewable energy.\n\nFossil fuel companies have received \u00a380bn in UK government support since 2015. Most of the 24 new drilling licences were granted to foreign companies. On Friday it was revealed that an oil and gas company owned by a major Tory donor, which had previously been fined for illegal flaring, was awarded one of the drilling licences.\n\nIn January, the former Conservative energy minister Chris Skidmore resigned as an MP in protest at the party\u2019s dash for oil and gas, calling the policy a \u201ctragedy\u201d that is \u201cwrong and will cause future harm\u201d."}

I would go to my local gym in New York and attempt to run on the treadmill, then make myself do leg raises until my abs were tender to the touch.\n\nThese gestures toward fitness were feeble; I never stopped smoking Camel Lights and always quit after a few sessions anyway. But I had already absorbed from diet and wellness culture the idea that I would become \u201cbetter\u201d if I became fit, so when I felt my messiest \u2013 bloated from bourbon, out of control with heroin and pills, eating huge quantities of diner food and vomiting it up until my throat bled \u2013 I looked to fitness as a beacon.\n\nAfter I got sober, I began working a physically demanding job as a metalworker. I grew strong, but I remained unhealthy, smoking, starving myself, and eating bodega food. I lived in my body as a hostage lives in a room.\n\nThen, in my late twenties, I tried for what felt like the millionth time to go for a run, and something had changed. Not physically \u2013 I was still a mess, which my running log shows (ran to Target \u2013 about a mile away \u2013 threw up, walked home). But for the first time, I was able to remain in the discomfort and find the willingness to keep going.\n\nWithin a few months, I was clocking 10 to 15 mile runs across all the bridges to Brooklyn, up and down the West Side Highway esplanade, around and around Central Park or Prospect Park. I could run, and far, and I became obsessed with testing how far I could go. My body grew harder and more taut, as I\u2019d always desired, and my feet peeled apart in bloody layers.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize the running was not about fitness, sport or even physicality. I was not out there just to be an athlete. I was out there to see how hard I could push myself, and to carve out a space to disappear into.\n\nThe first time I used the phrase \u201cexercise addiction\u201d was in a piece of writing. I was in my thirties, enrolled in an MFA program but cognitively fried from the effects of the seven daily hours I was spending working out.\n\nBy then, I had three gym memberships, three coaches (one of whom I kept secret from the other two to avoid conversations about overtraining), and standing appointments at a long list of group fitness classes. I was constantly training for marathons, I was lying to friends about how much I was exercising, and I was in too much pain to sleep at night or walk properly. I lived on tins of sardines, whole avocados and cans of coconut cream.\n\nAs they say in recovery fellowships, I was skidding along the bottom.\n\nIt felt so stupid saying \u201cexercise addiction\u201d that I redacted it from my essay before submitting to my writing workshop. I thought people would laugh at me because I wasn\u2019t exercising enough to have earned the distinction of being called an addict.\n\nI lived in my body as a hostage lives in a room\n\nI spent my days rushing from one gym to another and gobbling cold slices of sweet potato out of Ziploc bags in between workouts. During this period of my life, I received more non-sexual positive feedback on my body than I ever have before or since. At the gym, at the grocery store, on campus, at yoga and on social media, people approached me to tell me how strong I looked, how jacked I was. They asked what I did for workouts, what I ate, if I would train them. They looked at me with what I can only describe as admiration.\n\nThis was also when I met my partner, a professional strength and conditioning coach who trains elite athletes.\n\n\u201cBabe,\u201d I asked him recently, \u201cdo you think I had an exercise addiction when we met?\u201d\n\nThis man \u2013 someone I have watched lift over 400lbs in flip flops \u2013 laughed in response, shaking his head at how obviously the answer was yes.\n\nWhat was most confusing about those years was that, to my understanding, I was doing everything right. I was getting all my steps in, doing Hiit and weight bearing exercise, avoiding processed foods and sugar. According to the Instagram wellness influencer metric of health, I was doing great. So when symptoms like missed periods, chronic pain, deep episodic exhaustion and insomnia cropped up, I figured I just wasn\u2019t doing enough, and I tried to do better \u2013 which to me meant doing more. I added in more yoga and a night treadmill run; I cut seed oils out of my diet.\n\nIt did not once occur to me that doing too much might be the source of my problems.\n\nIn addiction medicine, there\u2019s no consensus on what exercise addiction is. It isn\u2019t mentioned in the American Society of Addiction Medicine textbook, and, like many behavioral addictions, it isn\u2019t named in the DSM-5. But when I talked to addiction psychiatrist and bioethicist Dr Carl Erik Fisher, he told me: \u201cMy own experience as a clinician is that behavioral addictions are important phenomena. Many people suffer from them, and they deserve to be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nLike many behavioral addictions, there simply isn\u2019t enough quality research on exercise addiction or compulsion for doctors \u2013 who are, after all, scientists \u2013 to make firm statements about what it is, how it happens to a person, and what you might do about such a thing.\n\nI\u2019d been attending 12-step recovery meetings for a decade and a half for the \u201creal addictions\u201d I got sober from in my twenties. As my mental and physical health deteriorated, I began obliquely sharing some new concerns.\n\n\u201cI think I have a problem with the gym,\u201d I said at my regular weekly meeting. I felt absurd \u2013 like I had complained that I had too much money. Everyone wanted to go to the gym more often. How could it be a problem? After the meeting, a woman approached me to comment on my share. \u201cI wish I could have that one,\u201d she lamented, pulling on a vape. \u201cYou look great.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, softly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel good.\u201d\n\nOver the following months, I discovered that in 12-step culture you can talk about having a troubled relationship with drugs, alcohol, food, sex, relationships, money, work, shopping and even crime, and people Get It. Either they relate to the particulars, or they can extrapolate from their own difficulties to conjure some empathy for yours. But exercise? Not so much. People didn\u2019t understand how exercise could be an issue, or they were, by their own admission, jealous, or they failed to grasp the extent of what I was doing with my body.\n\nEven my therapist just suggested I shift gears from lifting to yoga, as if my athletic programming rather than my mental health was the issue. I had the strong sense she was out of her depth. I had also groomed my friends to accept the persona I had carefully built: a little unhinged but in a fun way, always on the way to the gym. I was able to hide the extent of my unmanageability, and I stopped trying to talk to anyone about my growing suspicion that athletics had become yet another thing I had lost control of.\n\nGroping for language to describe an experience that was becoming increasingly unmanageable, I found few resources. The conversations I tried to initiate with various doctors were useless at best, dismissive at worst. I was repeatedly told to just exercise less, as if I were not smart enough to understand that to be the sensible course of action.\n\nI was repeatedly told to just exercise less, as if I were not smart enough to understand that to be the sensible course of action\n\n\u201cIn medicine, there\u2019s a problem with being comfortable with the grey areas, the unknown. Providers feel inadequate when they don\u2019t know and don\u2019t have data, and project that as frustration,\u201d says addiction medicine physician Melody Glenn, MD. \u201cDSM-5 doesn\u2019t recognize exercise addiction, because there is a lack of research on the topic.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s what I do know: I exhibited every single one of the criteria cited in the paper Exercise dependence: a systematic review, for Psychology of Sport and Exercise which are modifications of the DSM criteria for substance use disorder: tolerance, withdrawal, lack of control, intention effects, time, reduction in other activities, and continuance.\n\nMy partner was the only person who saw most of what was going on. My problem was of a variety he had encountered professionally, and he recognized it for what it was: a psychological problem manifested through physical actions, which in habituation became a physiological condition. Fitness, for me, began as a pursuit of aesthetics, but I quickly learned it was actually the pursuit of power over myself. The weight I could lift or the speed I could move at was just a measure of how much I could push myself. Only in the gym or on the track have I ever felt fully in control of myself, and it was intoxicating.\n\nI didn\u2019t like him seeing my dysfunction. I wanted him to see my eight visible abdominal muscles, my six-and-a-half-minute mile and my two-hundred-pound squat and think I was hot and awesome. But he saw me unable to take a rest day, wobbling into the gym unable to lift because I had already worked out too much, spiraling into depression after an injury. He was too close, and too wise, to hide from.\n\nI have been addicted to many things, and of all of them, finding myself strung out on athletic training was the stealthiest and the most confusing to recognize and deal with. I overtrained myself into acute and chronic injury, adrenal fatigue, chronic illness, deep exhaustion, mental illness, mania and despair.\n\nI also didn\u2019t properly \u201crecover\u201d the way I have from the other things I\u2019ve leaned on too heavily to order my life. Unlike drugs and alcohol, eating disorders and depression, I never went to treatment or therapy specifically for my exercise addiction. The 12-step abstinence model didn\u2019t fit, because I didn\u2019t want to abstain from movement. I briefly tried cognitive behavioral therapy, the gold standard for treatment of behavioral addictions, and found it overwhelming. The only thing that worked was allowing the situation to unravel to the point that I could not tolerate its consequences.\n\nI rarely speak of my problem with exercise, and it wasn\u2019t until I published my book, Brutalities \u2013 in which I explore my lifelong fascination with physical extremity, including exercise \u2013 that I acknowledged it publicly.\n\nPart of the reason for this silence is that I don\u2019t always feel entirely recovered from it; in my head, it\u2019s still there, most days, as background noise in my head.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird, being a potato person,\u201d I said to my partner recently, by which I meant someone without visible musculature or tangible evidence of athleticism \u2013 literally a person the shape and consistency of a baked potato. \u201cBabe,\u201d he said to me, with a sad look on his face, \u201cyou look like an athlete.\u201d I take him at his word, because he is honest to a fault and assesses my body with a professional\u2019s neutral gaze. His impression isn\u2019t clouded like mine is. But I don\u2019t see any of it, because I am not strong like I once was, and I feel, in my regular-person body, too small and too weak and too slow, a person lacking the power I once had.\n\nWhen I look at videos of myself lifting during the year I was strung out on the gym, I see how strong I was. I also remember how weak I felt, and how many hours I made myself train in the pursuit of getting stronger. I don\u2019t think I ever fully enjoyed my power when I had it, which to me is the saddest part of the whole thing.\n\nLike many of my addictions, I let go of overexercise only when its damages became intolerable. When my chronic illness, exacerbated by overtraining, threatened first my fertility, then my pregnancy and then my ability to parent my child, I became able to behave reasonably in a way I had not been before.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m fully recovered, or particularly comfortable. These days, I train three or five days a week, for 30 minutes or an hour. I try to listen to my body, to not train if I\u2019m not feeling well. I am not fast or strong like I used to be \u2013 there\u2019s nothing special or extreme about the way I work out. I\u2019m just out here trying to preserve longevity and keep my bones and heart healthy like everyone else.\n\nOn my hands, I feel with the pad of my thumb for the barbell callouses that used to sit like hard jewels at the bases of my fingers. Like little ghosts of who I used to be, they are barely there."}

What can we do to stop it?", "domain": "theguardian.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBggKMJeqezDfswk", "text": "To celebrate the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, Oxfam releases a study of how much of the world\u2019s wealth the ultra-rich own. This year\u2019s was a doozy. The five richest men in the world were revealed to have doubled their wealth in the years since 2020. Seven of the 10 biggest corporations in the world have a billionaire as their CEO or principal shareholder. Combined, the value of these companies \u2013 which include Apple, Microsoft and Saudi Aramco \u2013 exceeds the GDP of every single country in Africa and Latin America combined. That\u2019s 87 countries: virtually everything bought, sold, consumed produced and dreamed up by two billion people in a whole year.\n\nThe charity also reported that, within a decade, the world will probably see its first trillionaire. A trillion is a number (it\u2019s one followed by 12 zeros) to numb the mind. Even Ronald Reagan \u2013 a friend and ally to the ultra-rich if there ever was one \u2013 could not wrap his head around it. \u201cA few weeks ago I called such a figure, a trillion dollars, incomprehensible, and I\u2019ve been trying ever since to think of a way to illustrate how big a trillion really is,\u201d he said in 1981 when talking about the US national debt. \u201cAnd the best I could come up with is that if you had a stack of thousand-dollar bills in your hand only four inches high, you\u2019d be a millionaire. A trillion dollars would be a stack of thousand-dollar bills 67 miles high.\u201d\n\nBut what does it mean for a society to mint its first trillionaire, and how is it different from the wealth of oligarchs in the past?\n\nJohn Jacob Astor, a German-American businessman, is believed to have been the first American millionaire. He made his fortune in the 18th and 19th centuries by buying and selling stuff: namely fur, New York real estate and opium smuggled into China. Astor predicted trends and took advantage of geopolitics to get rich; he sold lots of things to lots of people; and his wealth generated more wealth. So far, so straightforward.\n\nThen came John D Rockefeller, the world\u2019s first billionaire. Rockefeller built and invested in oil refineries just as the world was getting hooked on kerosene and gasoline. He came to preside over a vast monopoly, choking the competition, which made him and his firm, Standard Oil, even richer. What Rockefeller sold to the public was more ephemeral than Astor\u2019s furs and houses \u2013 the very nature of energy is that it gets used up. But you could still see, smell and touch it, and you could see when it was gone. For better or worse, Standard Oil\u2019s products existed in the real world. We are all paying the environmental price.\n\nThere are about 2,640 Rockefellers in our world today, according to Forbes. They all got their start in their own unique way: founding companies, buying buildings, inheriting assets from family and so on, though young billionaires mostly work in the finance and tech sectors, profiting less directly from material things than knowledge, ideas and gambles. The way that many of these fortunes reached such dizzying proportions is through investments and speculation. The billionaire class doesn\u2019t just work: it puts its money to work, too, and the market rewards it well.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018John D Rockefeller (left) built and invested in oil refineries just as the world was getting hooked on kerosene and gasoline.\u2019 Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images\n\nThe Bloomberg billionaires index, which ranks the world\u2019s 500 richest people, is updated at the end of each trading day, revealing how dramatically that wealth can rise and fall. On 24 January, Elon Musk, who tops the list, lost $937m, just like that. Life is tough for the men and women at the bottom, too: the Wall Street financier Carl Icahn, No 497, was down $17.9m from a day prior. The aristocrat Hugh Grosvenor, whose fortune is in real estate, lost and gained nothing that day. He ranked No 157.\n\nThese fluctuations are instructive: they show us that the budding trillionaire\u2019s lucre looks to be of a more speculative, more abstract, often less liquid nature. The actual sum of money they control isn\u2019t the point \u2013 not when it can rise and fall so quickly.\n\nThe earnings of the ultra-rich are literally unearned. This isn\u2019t a value judgment: it\u2019s the US tax agency\u2019s term for money made through \u201cinvestment-type income such as taxable interest, ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions\u201d. While Astor and Rockefeller surely followed the wealth-maximising maxim of buy low, sell high, and put money in trusts, charities and other vehicles to minimise taxation, we\u2019ve seen this logic taken to the next level, without policy changes to correct for it.\n\nMost of us pay tax on our incomes at double-digit rates; if we\u2019re fortunate enough to own assets, we pay tax on the profits when we sell them. Billionaires, on the other hand, \u201ccan borrow against their growing investments year after year without owing a dime in taxes, allowing them to pay lower tax rates on their income than ordinary Americans pay on theirs\u201d. That statement doesn\u2019t come from Bernie Sanders, by the way, but from the achingly centrist White House, which in 2022 proposed a 20% minimum tax on households worth more than $100m. It went nowhere, in part because its subjects so strongly opposed it.\n\nThe impending arrival of the trillionaire signals another step backwards in the fight for a more balanced economy and healthier democracy. The billionaire class, after all, skews the balance of power in the marketplace, in politics and in society. Its members own newspapers that shape public opinion. They donate to politicians who pass the laws that they want. According to one study, 11% of the world\u2019s billionaires have held or sought political office, with the rate of \u201cbillionaire participation\u201d in autocracies hitting an astounding 29%. Another study shows they tend to lean to the right: positions that typically help them keep their own wealth, and that of their peers, intact.\n\nHistorically, the most significant reductions in economic inequality have come after wars, plagues and widespread immiseration. We are living through an era marked by all of those things, yet are coming out of it none the wiser: the proof is that we will soon enter the age of the trillionaire. Raising taxes, bolstering democratic institutions and seeking to redistribute resources to those who need them are all excellent initiatives worthy of widespread public support. And they should be envisioned not just nationally, but globally: inequality between countries and peoples matters, too.\n\nBut governments shouldn\u2019t rule out more radical measures, such as limitarianism \u2013 that is, capping how much wealth a person can legally have. Once you reach a certain number of zeros, those digits on a screen are just that: digits of increasing abstraction. They don\u2019t correspond to security, lifestyle or even pleasure. It\u2019s time to knock a few of them off."}

But we must act and act now,\u201d Mitchell said on Monday.\n\nThe country is suffering from the impacts of long-term El Ni\u00f1o-driven drought and brutal conflict, including the two-year war in the northern region of Tigray that ended in November 2022.\n\nThe UK, which has long made Ethiopia a priority country, is slowly reversing large cuts to its aid programme. On his trip Mitchell met the Ethiopian prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, in Addis Ababa and travelled to the Tigray regional capital, Mekelle. The underlying message of his trip was to warn that a famine can be averted but only if aid is prepared now.\n\n\n\nLike many Foreign Office ministers, Mitchell has been preoccupied by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, but fears equally important crises elsewhere \u2013 such as in Ethiopia \u2013 have lost the world\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cAcross northern Ethiopia, millions of people are facing hunger,\u201d he said. \u201cWar, including the conflict in Tigray and climate change, have crippled crop production and driven people off their lands.\u201d\n\nMitchell was told that 1 million people had been displaced and 3 million plunged into a state of critical food security and hunger.\n\nInternational donors have been trying to respond to an estimated 6.6 million people in need of help. Last week the UN said the number of critically food insecure people was likely to reach 10.8 million during the July-September lean season.\n\n\u201cMalnutrition rates in parts of Afar, Amhara and Tigray and other regions have already surpassed globally recognised crisis thresholds, although the situation is currently not reflective of famine-like conditions,\u201d the UN said.\n\nThe UK has launched a fund for ending preventable deaths, targeted at children \u2013 particularly under-fives \u2013 as well as pregnant and postnatal women.\n\nThe \u00a3100m programme is intended to help more than 3 million Ethiopians through a network of 75 health centres tackle malnutrition and other preventable causes of death, such as malaria and cholera, by increasing access to family planning support, medicines, and childhood vaccinations.\n\nEthiopia has the fourth highest level of maternal mortality in the world, with 10,000 mothers a year dying from pregnancy and childbirth-related causes. Many of these deaths could be prevented by simple support before, during and after pregnancy with medicines, nutrition supplements, clean water and access to sanitation in health centres.\n\nMitchell said: \u201cThe crisis is a wake-up call to the world. Food shortages are at a critical level. War has displaced people and decimated vital infrastructure. Climate change and El Ni\u00f1o have fuelled local exoduses, with 400,000 displaced in the Somali region of Ethiopia last November alone.\n\n\u201cMillions are trapped in a destructive spiral of displacement, hunger and need. As ever the most vulnerable people, particularly women and children, are the first to be hit.\n\n\u201cThe international community needs to come to Ethiopia\u2019s side and work with our friends in the government and international partners to halt and reverse this crisis. In a region that has experienced the horrors of famine in the past, we must ramp up international efforts to avert a major crisis in the near future.\u201d\n\nGetachew Reda, the president of the interim authority in Tigray, has said that 91% of the population of the semi-arid region is exposed to the risk of starvation and death and has called on the federal government in Addis Ababa to help."}

An MRI scan and biopsy had confirmed that our cat, Kevin, had inoperable throat cancer. I thanked the vet for the care she had lavished on him, and booked his death for 2pm the same day.\n\nI hung up the phone. I stood in the garden, dazed. Then I started to howl. I howled in grief, I howled in anger, I howled at the injustice of it all.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to tell my wife. She had heard the howling. We held each other, tears rolling on to each other\u2019s shoulders, as I recalled the nights that Kevin and I had spent together while she was in hospital undergoing chemo and a bone marrow transplant to treat her lymphoma. Kevin was my confidant. When you worry that your other half isn\u2019t coming home again, the last person you can share that with is your other half. Kevin was there whenever I had needed a big ginger shoulder to lean on.\n\nMRI scans and biopsies have loomed larger than we ever imagined when Kevin walked into our lives in 2017, a stray from the local railway line.\n\nI wrote about him then, but he was still camera shy and we didn\u2019t have many pictures to illustrate the article. It took us months to decide whether he was actually \u201cours\u201d, and by the time we had him chipped and sterilised, he had sown a final round of wild oats that produced four adorable ginger kittens, two of which died young. We adopted the two survivors, though their mother \u2013 a long-haired wild cat of the old school \u2013 declined to join them. We still feed her, and have had her sterilised, too.\n\nMost of our beloved pets die scared, surrounded by strangers. Kevin deserved better\n\nThe truth with Kevin was that we always felt that he adopted us, not the other way round. We both felt honoured and enriched by his presence, though he never shook off the distrust of strangers that had kept him alive for the year or so we think he spent in the wild. He loved the comforts of home, and on a soft cushion, a shabby old sofa or a warm spot by the fire all his standoffishness would vanish as he fully appreciated the moment.\n\nI have never known a cat with so many facial expressions, and when he wanted to, he could appear leading-man handsome, despite his torn left ear. Over the years he was with us, we certainly made up for that early lack of photos. It was a joy to see a cat that had snarled and growled at us so viciously go soft around the edges.\n\nI dug a grave for him that June morning, under a willow tree in the garden, next to one of his kittens that died. Whenever the spade hit a stone, I\u2019d scrabble it out of the hole with my bare hands, venting a grief I hadn\u2019t felt since my father died suddenly when I was a teenager.\n\nWe drove to the vets for Kevin\u2019s death. I wanted to be there: I once read an article in which a vet claimed that 70% of pet owners can\u2019t face being with their animals when they die. This means that most of our beloved pets die scared, surrounded by strangers. Kevin deserved better.\n\nHe was in a cage when we arrived, conscious, but with hydration tubes coming out of him. We stroked him. He purred. We touched our heads to his and said thank you. The vet gave us a final 10 minutes with him, then put him to sleep before administering the lethal injection. He breathed in once more, and was gone.\n\nI doubt my own end will be as dignified.\n\nThank you, Kevin. We\u2019ll take good care of the kids."}

That\u2019s what this is,\u201d she says patiently, giving my hand a squeeze. Oh, right, I say. OK. Yes, good.\n\nTwo months after my last diary entry, something weird has occurred. Having written the experiment off as a waste of time, it seems to be bearing perverse fruit. I\u2019m currently on my phone for 90 minutes a day. Five of those are spent on Instagram. I no longer feel addicted. My diminished online life is partly due to no longer having to scan the savannah for a mate. But that can\u2019t be the whole story.\n\nAll the experts I spoke to gave reassuringly similar advice. Strangely, the most impactful tech conversation was in a wifi-less cafe, with a Buddhist. Sthiramanas is a meditation teacher from the London Buddhist Centre, where he runs Upgrade Your Mind, a six-week course on mindful screen use.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental human weakness to look outside for satisfaction,\u201d he says. Sthiramanas doesn\u2019t just mean endless scrolling. Running to a silent retreat \u2013 or a digital detox cabin in the woods \u2013 is also an escape from day-to-day life. Their lessons often don\u2019t survive the journey home. \u201cIf we want our lives to be happier and more creative, we have to experience them as they are, and change things from there.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the desire underneath the desire to check your phone?\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you\u2019re addicted to dating apps, is it the desire to feel attractive? If you\u2019re a news junkie, do you want to feel in control? Or in contact with something bigger than yourself? If you\u2019re constantly texting friends, do you just want to be loved?\u201d\n\nOuch. When did these Buddhists choose violence?\n\nSince that chat, I see friendship as a mostly offline activity. Something we do with our bodies. My gang are good for this \u2013 arranging day trips to the seaside, dancing, cooking for each other. Laughing in the same space is nourishing. Sounds Waltons-esque, but it\u2019s better than Meta. I do still often text friends through the day, but when not, I enjoy missing them. Maybe I\u2019ve gone weird.\n\nView image in fullscreen Can I enjoy being in my actual, \u2018boring\u2019 life, without the fantasy of escape? Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian\n\nConstant connectivity is a new expectation, exhausting to meet. My worst fear about turning my phone off has been missing a call from my mother, should she have a fall. But underneath my reluctance, I realize, is an anxiety of control. And one day we must all relinquish that. \u201cYou could get a landline for emergencies, and only give the number to loved ones,\u201d suggests Sthiramanas. It\u2019s a good idea.\n\nAnother slow burn has been the increase in time spent reading. I think it\u2019s also the reason I no longer lose whole days on Instagram. Opening any social media apps now, they strike me as \u2026 silly. Maybe concentration really is a muscle \u2013 that hungers to lift heavier things as you build it. Of course, plenty of people enjoy both. This isn\u2019t to say all social media content is shallow and pointless!

This has been the crucial question for me.\n\nI tidy my flat more, because I\u2019m seeing it more. I\u2019ve kept up my 10,000 steps. I still like filling up those fitness tracking circles, but am less obsessive. I can feel the effect in my body. I sometimes leave my phone at home. It\u2019s a mental reset to feel the air, to not be somewhere else. And I\u2019m much happier than I was.\n\nFor any capitalism fans, I must note that my freelance income has risen, and I\u2019m more productive. I don\u2019t find it helpful to vilify tech companies so much, and no longer personify my phone. The shiny, infinite-content machine is not a muse, cold lover or nemesis. It\u2019s a tool. More than anything else, it\u2019s a barometer of my discontent.\n\nWhen I notice that weight in my hand, the pull toward distraction and escape, I try to diagnose what\u2019s really going on with me. Am I worried about something? Am I lonely? What would be a better way to meet my needs? If I\u2019m simply bored, I\u2019m learning to trust there\u2019s a creativity hidden in that place.\n\nWho could have foreseen this? The smartphone as canary in the coal mine, signposting what is most important to me: to not sleepwalk through these days. Thief of my life? No one gets to steal my life.\n\nUnfortunately, I am now addicted to sugar."}

This is because industrial cheesemaking has become dependent on one strain of the bug, rather than using the vigorous, multicoloured bacteria of the past. Until the 1950s, camemberts had grey, green and orangey mould, apparently (I feel a bit queasy thinking about it), but the food industry wanted camembert white and velvety. If I understand correctly, the albino bacteria it selected aren\u2019t able to reproduce with other strains. Now, mutations mean the bacteria are also losing the ability to reproduce asexually, putting the whole stinking enterprise at risk.\n\nIt\u2019s not just camembert; roquefort faces an equivalent threat. A similar cheese, bleu de termignon has sufficiently closely related bacteria that could help reinvigorate roquefort, but there\u2019s no solution in sight for camembert, Normandy\u2019s most precious export.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t Paris burning? I don\u2019t care, really \u2013 I hate camembert, always have, and will happily dance on its grave (in full PPE) \u2013 but the news landed hard with my Norman husband. Camembert is a religion there: his grandparents ate it for breakfast, dipped in their morning coffee; le claquos (its pet name) reigns over every family meal. Exiled from the real stuff here in the UK, he pokes supermarket camemberts gloomily, judging its maturity and odour and invariably finding it wanting. Faced with this news, he ran a full K\u00fcbler-Ross scale, from denial \u2013 \u201cC\u2019est fake news, camembert cannot die\u201d \u2013 to depression: \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the world.\u201d He hasn\u2019t reached acceptance, yet, but is profoundly questioning his life\u2019s purpose: \u201cShould my new mission be to save camembert?\u201d he messaged me this week.\n\nIf my husband doesn\u2019t, I think Emmanuel Macron, who continues to be about as popular as a Babybel on a Normandy cheeseboard, should. He could do worse than throwing \u20ac1bn and a pretentiously named institute at this problem; it\u2019s a better \u2013 and surely more popular \u2013 move than courting far-right voters and defending G\u00e9rard Depardieu.\n\nEmma Beddington is a Guardian columnist\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In a courtyard strewn with colourful paper and fabric scraps, a handful of women are working on costumes.\n\nThe mostly middle-aged black women snipping, gluing and painting belong to one of Rio\u2019s newest samba schools: Turma da Paz de Madureira (TPM), or the Madureira Group of Peace. All of its members, from the directors down to the percussionists and dancers, are women.\n\n\u201cWe are the only all-female samba school in Brazil,\u201d says Barbara Rigaud, TPM\u2019s president and founder.\n\nWomen have always been closely involved in Rio\u2019s samba schools, not just as tailors and sparkly samba muses but also as musicians and participants in the creative process. Yet rarely have they occupied positions of power, or had their contributions to these community based musical organisations recognised. The pioneer sambista Dona Ivone Lara famously had to let male relatives sign her compositions for years before she became, in 1965, the first woman to be accepted as a composer in a samba school, the Madureira-based Imp\u00e9rio Serrano.\n\nView image in fullscreen Barbara Rigaud (centre), the president of the TPM, with other samba school members at last year\u2019s street parade in Rio de Janeiro. Photograph: TPM\n\n\u201cThere was a constant presence of women in these spaces, they participated actively, and not just as hypersexualised [dancers],\u201d says the historian Alessandra Tavares, highlighting the objectification of (usually black) women that has long dominated stereotypes of Rio\u2019s carnival. \u201cHistory never gave women the visibility they were due.\u201d\n\nRigaud is striving to change that. \u201cEnough of being bossed around by men,\u201d says the 55-year-old, who runs a beauty salon when she isn\u2019t putting her heart and soul into carnival productions.\n\nWe face a lot of prejudice and mockery because we\u2019re being innovative Barbara Rigaud, TPM president and founder\n\nA survivor of sexual violence in a country where a woman or girl was raped every eight minutes in the first six months of 2023, Rigaud feels that bringing women together in this way can help transform lives. \u201cI think women join TPM because they have freedom here, they can see their worth and how important they are,\u201d she says during a conversation in the courtyard that serves as the school\u2019s headquarters and rehearsal ground.\n\nGisele Rosires, a security professional whose life has been marked by hardship and loss, agrees. \u201cI always say that TPM saved me,\u201d says Rosires, 47, who plays the surdo drum, a bulky instrument long considered the preserve of men. \u201cLots of girls are struggling. And when you see one succeeding, that incentivises another. I think that\u2019s what makes TPM different, it empowers people.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018This year\u2019s performance will be better than last\u2019: conductor Paloma Bento leads band rehearsals\n\nTPM was born in 2013 as a women-only bloco, a musical group that leads carnival street parties. Its debut performance as Rio\u2019s first all-female samba school was last year, with about 320 members parading in the lowest-tier samba league in the city\u2019s northern suburbs (only the schools in the top leagues perform in the purpose-built Sambadrome, 20km away in the city centre). It came third and this year will compete in the bronze league with a 600-strong procession featuring 100 percussionists and an eight metre-long float.\n\nThe samba-enredo song they have chosen for 17 February\u2019s parade is a re-edition of a composition first performed by Imp\u00e9rio Serrano, aptly named Lugar de Mulher \u00c9 Onde Ela Quiser! (A woman\u2019s place is wherever she wants).\n\nView image in fullscreen Samba dancers rehearse their steps. This year\u2019s parade will be the groups second time performing at Rio\u2019s carnival\n\nRigaud, who acts as creative director, has envisioned a dozen sections of dancers and musicians in costumes paying tribute to pioneering female figures, such as the indigenous warrior Clara Camar\u00e3o, and celebrate everyday empowered women, such as an entrepreneur, a police officer and a university graduate.\n\nMeeting that vision is no easy task, however, and Rigaud has had to get creative, recycling costumes used in last year\u2019s parade and picking up donated or discarded materials wherever possible. \u201cThis was rubbish, but not any more. It\u2019s being turned into gold,\u201d she says, pointing to scraps of velvet.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Her Stage Free monthly newsletter Hear directly from incredible women from around the world on the issues that matter most to them \u2013 from the climate crisis to the arts to sport Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

TPM members also feel they face more obstacles than most due to persistent sexism and patriarchal norms \u2013 starting with the sniggers that sometimes meet their name, as TPM in Portuguese is also the acronym for premenstrual syndrome. This was an accidental coincidence which Rigaud and her co-founders have embraced as a funny joke.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jaciara Maciel, a seamstress, works on a costume\n\nView image in fullscreen Margareth Oliveira, a director of one of TPM\u2019s dance groups, or \u2018alas\u2019, decorates a costume\n\n\u201cWe face a lot of prejudice and mockery because we\u2019re being innovative, you see? Getting such a large number of women together, it\u2019s different,\u201d she says.\n\nPercussion conductor Paloma Bento laments that rehearsals this year have been sparsely attended. \u201cWe recently lost a percussionist because her 90-year-old mother became bed-bound and depends on her for everything. There\u2019s this other woman who often has to look after her grandchildren. I don\u2019t think this would be happening if they were men,\u201d says Bento, 34. Women are the main breadwinner in more than half of Brazilian households (15% are headed by single mothers), yet on average they spend nearly twice as much time as men on domestic chores and care work.\n\nBut these challenges will be forgotten as TPM members begin their 400-metre procession this month. \u201cOn the day of the parade, everything will work out, like it did last year,\u201d says Bento. \u201cThis year\u2019s performance will be better than last year\u2019s, and next year it will be better still.\u201d"}

It will move a lot,\u201d said Jacques Sebag, the site\u2019s assembly integration and verification manager.\n\nUsing a laser pointer, Sebag points out the width of the telescope\u2019s 8.4-metre diameter mirror, fitted with a state-of-the-art 3,200-megapixel camera.\n\nIt is designed to capture an unprecedented amount of astronomical data in a 10-year survey called the LSST (Legacy Survey of Space and Time).\n\n\u201cBefore this, telescopes saw small areas of the space, looking at very specific information for a very specific problem, but this is like a lighthouse,\u201d he said, his hands spreading out to convey the vast celestial canopy. \u201cIt [illuminates] different parts of the sky. It is the fastest-moving telescope ever built.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen A wide view of the telescope mount inside the dome. Photograph: H Stockebrand/RubinObs/NSF/Aura\n\nThe telescope is distinctively squat and compact in design, allowing it to constantly shift and observe changes, registering what astronomers call \u201cthe transient sky\u201d.\n\nEvery night it will detect 10m events, ranging from asteroid movement to supernova explosions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very rich dataset, it has something for almost everybody in astronomy,\u201d said Frossie Economou, the site\u2019s technical manager for data management.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll answer questions about the universe from our local neighbourhood \u2013 the solar system \u2013 to the creation of time, out there in the far reaches.\u201d\n\nConstruction of the observatory, which is named after the North American astronomer who proved the existence of dark matter, began in 2015.\n\nThe project is principally envisioned to address uncertainties about dark matter and dark energy, which make up more than 70% of the universe.\n\nChile is home to a number of the world\u2019s most important astronomical centres. The altitude of the Andean mountains that frame the country, and the lack of light pollution in the sparsely populated desert areas, make for ideal skygazing conditions. The Rubin site enjoys an average of 256 clear nights a year.\n\nView image in fullscreen The telescope at sunset. Photograph: RubinObs/NSF/Aura/H Stockebrand\n\nWith the completion of the Rubin project, Chile will become the leading destination of astronomical observation, generating about 70% of data seen from Earth by 2025.\n\nSteve Heathcote is the director of Cerro Tololo, a neighbouring observatory that has conducted studies that serve as a precursor for Rubin.\n\nThe telescopes at Cerro Tololo were integral to the discovery of the universe\u2019s accelerated expansion, work that won the Nobel prize for astrophysics in 2011.\n\nHeathcote is hopeful that, once again, Chilean skies will help unlock more of the mysteries surrounding the creation of our universe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough uncertainty in current measurements that you could fit in something different,\u201d he explained, referring to our understanding of the big bang and universe expansion. \u201cI think with Rubin, they\u2019ll be able to get the errors down to the point where you can be sure.\n\n\u201cIt could challenge Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. It could challenge fundamental things in physics.\u201d\n\nOver 10 years, the LSST will generate a staggering 60 petabytes (60,000,000 gigabytes) of data through 2m images. The UK is responsible for processing about 25% of this data.\n\nAprajita Verma is based at the University of Oxford and is Rubin\u2019s international program coordinator. She refers to the LSST as \u201cthe greatest movie of the sky that mankind has ever made\u201d.\n\n\u201cI find it overwhelming. It really will revolutionise our view of survey astronomy and understanding of the billions of objects that we\u2019re gonna see.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Claudia Llanquitruf: \u2018It\u2019s an honour to work here.\u2019 Photograph: Charis McGowan\n\nThe excitement of the project is rippling through the global astronomical community but is equally felt locally.\n\nClaudia Llanquitruf has been involved in the construction of the site\u2019s revolving dome since 2019.\n\nShe manages a company that is usually tasked with mining projects, based in the city of La Serena, about two hours from Rubin.\n\nLlanquitruf is in awe of the site.\n\n\u201cI know what this project means, and all the studies it\u2019s going to generate.

I see no sign that he does", "domain": "theguardian.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBggKMJeqezDfswk", "text": "It\u2019s easy to determine the morality of a political party by examining who is welcome and who is not. In Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour, apologists for war crimes rise to the top, while opponents of mass slaughter face the boot. This is not hyperbole. When Israel\u2019s slaughter of Gaza began, Starmer publicly declared that Israel had the right to cut off water and electricity. As a human rights lawyer \u2013 who previously argued at the international court of justice (ICJ) that the 1991 Serbian siege of Vukovar constituted genocide \u2013 there was no excuse: article 33 of the Geneva conventions, for a start, prohibits collective punishment. Facing an immediate and merited backlash, he sought to claim he had not said what he, in fact, had. \u201cI was saying Israel had the right to self-defence,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen I said \u2018that right\u2019, it was that right to self-defence. I was not saying Israel had the right to cut off water, food, fuel or medicines \u2013 on the contrary.\u201d\n\nLabour MP Kate Osamor, on the other hand, was suspended after referring to Israel\u2019s onslaught as a genocide. She did so on the same day that the world\u2019s highest court recognised the potential for a finding of genocide and ordered Israel to take action to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza. Note that Osamor is left wing, and one of Labour\u2019s few black female MPs: two others have already been sent packing.\n\nThese actions have repercussions, and last week it was revealed that Labour has begun to panic over disillusionment among Muslim voters, who represent a significant portion of its electoral coalition, and is preparing an outreach effort. One frontbencher admitted such voters were \u201cno longer a safe voter base for us because of how we initially responded to the war\u201d, meaning \u201cdamage control\u201d was all that was left. And why the outreach: to reassure an important and valued constituency, or to shore up the vote? One Labour MP leaves no room for doubt. Labour Muslims are \u201cgeographically important\u201d, they said \u2013 many live in key target seats.\n\nIf Labour wishes to woo Muslim voters, it might consider that many cannot support a party lined up behind what may yet be officially ruled by the ICJ as a genocide. Or a party that has created a hostile environment for those opposed to mass slaughter. After many Muslim Labour councillors quit in disgust over Gaza, one party source boasted it was a sign the party was \u201cshaking off the fleas\u201d. In the tawdry Batley and Spen byelection in 2021 \u2013 when Labour barely clung on \u2013 a party source claimed it had \u201clost the conservative Muslim vote over gay rights and Palestine\u201d, but won back Tory voters, showing \u201cwe\u2019re reconnecting with the wider electorate again\u201d. Labour figures seemed to delight in the sowing: the reaping is not proving quite as much fun.\n\nThe party may conclude that the electoral consequences of this moral bankruptcy will be minimal. But many of its natural voters \u2013 not just British Muslims \u2013 do care about Gaza, and they have taken note. When the shadow foreign secretary David Lammy last week claimed that \u201cLabour has been clear throughout the conflict that international law must be upheld\u201d, he neglected to mention Starmer\u2019s initial support for the siege, the other shadow cabinet members refusing to condemn cutting off the essentials of life, and his own refusal to condemn forcible displacement, which in the case of Gaza surely amounts to a war crime.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Starmer dropped Labour\u2019s commitment to unilaterally recognise an independent Palestinian state, saying it would only do so as part of a process towards a two-state solution as an \u201can appropriate part of the process\u201d. He was then outflanked by Conservative foreign secretary David Cameron, who did not make British recognition contingent on Israel.\n\nLabour\u2019s position has been so pernicious because it has given carte blanche to the government to line up behind Israeli atrocities. When Labour MP Tahir Ali accused Rishi Sunak of having \u201cblood on his hands\u201d, he was forced to apologise or face removal of Labour\u2019s party whip.\n\nThe Conservatives are guilty of murderous complicity, through arms sales and diplomatic support for Israel, yet Labour has protected them from paying any political price for it. By late December, 71% of British voters backed an immediate ceasefire, but with Labour lining up behind the government stance, the Tories have been shielded from public pressure.\n\nWhat, then, of the long-term consequences? Labour will surely win the election thanks to the Tories\u2019 comprehensive self-destruction. But there is no enthusiasm for the Labour leadership, thanks to the absence of a positive domestic agenda and now this moral debacle over Gaza. As the Labour MP and former Blair adviser Jon Cruddas puts it, Labour\u2019s \u201cmost rightwing, illiberal faction\u201d is now dominant.\n\nIn his leadership pitch to Labour members Starmer pledged to \u201cput human rights at the heart of foreign policy\u201d. Many voters \u2013 not just Muslims, but all of those for whom mass slaughter of innocent people doesn\u2019t sit well \u2013 have witnessed something else: support for war crimes and failure to condemn them, while opponents of an alleged genocide have been punished and purged.\n\nAn administration that lacks meaningful answers to domestic crises and is wedded to a toxic foreign policy will soon find itself in trouble. Look at Starmer\u2019s political equivalents in the US, Germany and Australia: they won but swiftly became unpopular, and none U-turned so comprehensively as him on their original promises. If he enjoys a honeymoon, it will be short-lived.\n\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist"}

Six fast, easy ways to improve your mobility \u2013 and live a longer life", "domain": "theguardian.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBggKMJeqezDfswk", "text": "Remember the mobility challenge that went viral last year? It goes like this. You\u2019re standing up; you can\u2019t use your hands, so start by crossing your arms across your body. Cross one leg in front of the other. Drop down to sit cross-legged on the floor. From here, get on your knees with your toes behind you. Now pop backwards into a deep squat, the one where your butt is against your heels. Now stand up.\n\nIt\u2019s hard, right? Most people can\u2019t do it. And yet you can\u2019t afford to ignore this stuff. Poor mobility can greatly affect your quality of life, making everything from washing yourself to cleaning your home difficult or painful. And, although it may not kill you, it is certainly correlated with early death.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011, Brazilian researchers tracked 2,000 people aged 51 to 80 who had taken part in a test requiring them to sit on the floor from standing, then get back up, all without using their hands, knees or arms. Over the following nine years, those who failed this \u201csitting-rising test\u201d, whatever their age, were five to six times more likely to die earlier.\n\nMobility is deadly serious, then, especially as you age. But \u2013 newsflash, 25-year-olds \u2013 the best way to keep it is never to lose it.\n\n\u201cNo worries,\u201d as the mobility coach Roger Frampton likes to say. \u201cWe can scale it.\u201d The only difference between a beginner and an elite, in mobility, is range of movement. Anything you practise that pushes you to the edge of your range will extend it. If you can get on to the floor without using your hands, say, but can\u2019t get back up, you can give yourself an advantage by sitting on a cushion. This is quite a guerrilla form of self-improvement.\n\nFrampton describes mobility as \u201cusable flexibility\u201d, or flexibility that isn\u2019t coming at the expense of strength. He uses himself as a case study: \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, you\u2019re trying to look a certain way. In my mid-20s, I was going to the gym, doing a lot of strength stuff. I was ridiculously tight, couldn\u2019t touch my toes.\u201d When he became a model, they wanted him to look less beefy, and after that his flexibility improved, \u201cand I was almost \u2026 gumby, they call it in America. Another term is a \u2018white noodle\u2019. You\u2019ll see someone with incredible range, but there\u2019s no power behind it.\u201d It was in trying to reach a state of balance, with strength and flexibility working in concert rather than at the expense of the other, that he turned into Mr Mobility (he is on the web at roger.coach and on TikTok as @rogerframpton).\n\nAt first, I couldn\u2019t do last year\u2019s big challenge. Then, just messing about on my own, I could do it after a fashion, but only with my stronger leg crossed in front. In an ideal world, your legs might differ a bit in strength, but they shouldn\u2019t act as if they belong to two different people. To do this, or the sitting-rising test, gracefully, you need to be methodical. Break it down and work on each element. Once you can do the challenge, carry on doing it.\n\nSit cross-legged\n\nSit, slouching against a wall, with your feet out straight. Place one foot on your opposite thigh. Bend the other leg and try to sit up as straight as you can against the wall. Then repeat on the other side. You are trying to close the gap between your lower back and the wall, which took me a week (doing the exercise for two minutes a day). It is an incredible stretch and will improve the quality of your cross-legged sit \u2013 your back will be straighter, and your legs crossed tighter \u2013 but while you\u2019re there, you might notice that, with your legs straight in front of you, your back isn\u2019t straight but is slouching inwards, the curse of working at a desk.\n\nSo put a chair within arm\u2019s reach and stand against the wall, touching it with every bit of your legs, down to your heels. Drag the chair in front of you and place your hands on it. That\u2019s exactly the same straight-backed position as you want when you\u2019re on the floor, only you\u2019re relaxing down to find your perfect alignment, rather than trying to pull yourself up into it. You extend it over time by moving your legs further apart. This is another two-minute job, and I could sit straighter after a fortnight.\n\nView image in fullscreen Strengthen your glutes with wall sits. Composite: Getty images\n\nDo a wall sit\n\nNow you need to work on balance, for which the best starter exercise is standing on one leg with your eyes closed for 60 seconds. This reminds me a lot of going on holiday with my friend just after his catastrophic brain injury, when he had to relearn to walk backwards. All I could think was: \u201cHow is he making that look so hard?\u201d It\u2019s good at forcing you to engage a lot of muscle sets, as \u201cyou\u2019re working so much more than just your foot,\u201d Frampton says.\n\nThe other obstacle will be lack of strength in your glutes, and for this you can do a wall sit \u2013 as it sounds, sitting with your back touching a wall, but your bum floating as if on an invisible chair. Again, you can scale up in 15-second increments how long you hold it. Canadian Peter Attia, a doctor and author of Outlive: the Science and Art of Longevity, does the air sit \u2013 same exercise, without the wall, with your arms stretched out at shoulder height directly in front of you \u2013 for two minutes, which is insanely difficult; but try it for 10 seconds and, God willing, after 17 days you might get to 15 seconds.\n\nTouch your toes\n\nEveryone thinks they can still do it, but that\u2019s probably because it\u2019s a long time since they tried. This will take a month, but only three minutes a day. In the first week, do a leg elevated hinge \u2013 put your heel in front of you on a low chair and hinge towards it, with a straight back, for 30 seconds on each leg, three times. Week two, a hip hinge: standing with straight legs, arch your lower back and try to bend at the waist so you\u2019re at a 90-degree angle (but don\u2019t force it: just go as low as you can with your back still arched and not bending your knees) \u2013 for three sets of 10 bends. The third week, the same thing, only with a split stance, your weight on the front, straight leg \u2013 three sets of eight on each leg. Finally, a week of moving from a squat position to one with straight legs, bending at the waist so your head is level with your knees.\n\nHang for one minute\n\nI spent ages trying to find a tall enough door and not hurt myself, before I remembered that there are monkey bars in every park. This is good for grip strength, obviously, as well as upper body strength overall, but the best thing is that you can\u2019t mess it up. You have your two arms, and you have gravity, and there\u2019s absolutely no way for these things to interact except the right way. On the downside, it\u2019s pretty hard, and is one of the 11 tests Attia uses on patients as part of the Strength Metrics assessment (the goal is a minute and a half for a 40-year-old woman, two minutes for a 40-year-old man). But you can work up to that in increments as pathetic as you like \u2013 five seconds, even.\n\nView image in fullscreen While sitting on a chair, clasp your hands behind you to loosen tight shoulders. Composite: Getty images\n\nSit properly in a chair (and other ways to behave at a desk)\n\n\u201cYour body doesn\u2019t think about the future,\u201d Frampton says. \u201cYour body\u2019s trying to survive the day. It\u2019s not expecting to be around when it\u2019s 90.\u201d I\u2019d asked him why, for any stance that\u2019s habitual to you, does your body always find the worst possible way to do it?\n\nAnyway, at your desk, \u201ctry to sit on your legs and not your arse,\u201d Frampton advises. \u201cThat way, your back will be flat, your torso will be lifted and your shoulders will fall backwards.\u201d\n\nA simple stretch you can do while still at your desk is to put your arms out behind you, clasping your hands with your palms facing outwards. If you\u2019re really tight in the shoulders, you can start with a bend in the elbows. Hold it for a minute. Something I forgot to mention earlier: you never want to be in pain \u2013 it\u2019s not cardio.\n\nWorking at a desk, your head is pulled magnetically towards your screen, until you have a curved neck, which, besides anything else, if you carry it over into your walking style, is very ageing. Get into a wall sit, with your pelvis tucked in so your entire back is in contact with the wall; touch your head against it too, and move your chin to point to the ceiling, then draw it back in to your chest. If you\u2019re old enough, you can actually hear your neck making a gristly noise as it straightens. Or maybe that\u2019s just me. I hope not.\n\nOn public transport, stand without holding on to anything\n\nYou\u2019ll have to brace your core just to keep your balance, and subtly move against the jerky rhythm of the train or bus, but there\u2019s something relaxing about the low brain-stakes concentration. I didn\u2019t get this from an expert; I made it up. It really annoys my kids.\n\nFrampton thinks of the body as \u201cone piece of tissue. It makes sense from a learning perspective to divide it into your abs, your triceps, your chest, your glutes. But then when you\u2019re doing the mobility movements that I\u2019m describing, it almost becomes unhelpful to silo it like that.\u201d Ten minutes a day is enough, but you can never stop, I\u2019m afraid. \u201cYou could equally say: \u2018When do my teeth just become clean \u2013 when can I stop all this brushing?\u2019\u201d Frampton says. \u201cYou need to think of this as something you\u2019ll be doing for as long as you\u2019re alive.\u201d"}

Prior to this dig, only three Roman timber coffins in total have been found in the capital.\n\nWooden remains from the Roman era in Britain (AD43-410) rarely survive to the present day but, because the waterlogged burial site adjoins the now underground river Fleet, its graves were well preserved.\n\nThe funerary bed is made from high-quality oak and has carved feet and joints fixed with small wooden pegs. It was dismantled before being laid within the grave of an adult male in his late 20s or early 30s.\n\nView image in fullscreen Archaeologist excavating the funerary bed, in Holborn, London. Photograph: Mola\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been quite carefully taken apart and stashed, almost like flat-packed furniture for the next life,\u201d said Michael Marshall, an artefacts specialist with archaeologists Mola (Museum of London Archaeology) \u2013 although he stressed there was much about the burials that is yet to be studied. Excavations at the site continue.\n\nPart of the site, outside the walls of the Roman city and 6 metres below the modern ground level, had been excavated in the 1990s. However, \u201cthe bed was a complete surprise, because we\u2019ve never seen anything like it before\u201d, said Marshall. While there are accounts of people being carried on beds in funeral processions, and sometimes depictions of them on tombstones, he said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that people were buried in these kinds of Roman burials beds at all. That\u2019s something that there is no previous evidence for from Britain.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Reconstruction of Roman London by Peter Froste with the location of the site circled. Photograph: Mola\n\nNo other grave goods were found with the bed burial, but it was almost certainly a high-status person, said Marshall. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly well-made piece of furniture. This is a piece of proper joinery, as opposed to something has been sort of banged together. It\u2019s one of the fancier pieces of furniture that\u2019s ever been recovered from Roman Britain.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Mola\n\nPersonal objects were recovered from elsewhere in the cemetery, however, including beads, a glass vial apparently still containing residue, and a decorated lamp, thought to date to the very earliest period of Roman occupation between AD43 and 80.\n\nStrikingly, it is decorated with the design of a defeated gladiator, \u201cwhich is kind of a wonderful thing\u201d, said Marshall. Similar images have previously been found in funeral contexts in London and Colchester. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the symbolism of the fallen gladiator that makes sense in a funerary context. A defeated gladiator is somebody who is dying, obviously \u2013 but they also fight against death.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s evidence that some really quite subtle choices about how people mourned their dead are starting to come through from analysing these burials.\u201d"}

More than 20% of Muslim voters remain undecided, giving Labour some hope.\n\nIt is not only the party\u2019s support among one of its loyal voter bases that has plummeted, Keir Starmer\u2019s net favourability has dropped \u2013 albeit not as sharply \u2013 by 4 percentage points since 2021 and now sits at -11%.\n\nStarmer\u2019s net favourability was worse in north-west England, at -18%, a region that features constituencies with a large Muslim voter base including Blackburn, Manchester (Gorton, Withington and Central) and Preston.\n\nSenior Labour MPs remain united behind Starmer\u2019s efforts on the war, but have some concerns over being outdone by David Cameron, who was first to call for a sustainable ceasefire and last week said that the British government was considering recognising a Palestinian state.\n\nA Labour frontbencher told the Guardian: \u201cMany voters I\u2019ve spoken to in the area are furious with Starmer\u2019s muddling position over his recognition of Palestine\u2019s statehood. It hasn\u2019t gone down well. Fortunately for Labour the anger isn\u2019t quite at the peak of what it was in November, but ultimately people are still sore, so Labour has its work cut out for them.\u201d\n\nAs a result, British Muslims\u2019 identification with Labour as their natural choice has fallen by 49 percentage points, from 72% in 2021 to 29% this year. On top of this, 85% of British Muslims believe the political position of parties on the Israel-Gaza war will be important in influencing their vote at the polls this year.\n\nThe 2024 Survation survey was conducted via telephone, using a combination of landline and mobile phone; the same methodology was used for its 2021 poll for LMN in 2021, a year after Starmer took control of the party.\n\nIn better news for Labour, 62% of British Muslims polled said their view of the Conservative party had become more unfavourable over the last year, with 38% believing Labour had become more distasteful within the same period.\n\nA year into his leadership, Starmer was warned not to take the Muslim vote for granted amid concerns about Islamophobia in Labour and the party\u2019s stance on Palestine.\n\nPolling after a report into Islamophobia within the party was released in 2021 found that 55% of British Muslims did not \u201ctrust the leadership of the Labour party to tackle Islamophobia effectively\u201d and 48% did not have confidence in the party\u2019s complaints procedure to deal with Islamophobia.\n\nAnxieties within the community have also been raised over Apsana Begum\u2019s status within the party, as the position of the MP for Poplar and Limehouse remains in limbo after a trigger ballot was launched in 2022 when she was signed off sick after a campaign of what she described as \u201cmisogynistic abuse and harassment\u201d."}

But, with the situation in England actually worsening by many measures, the grand pledge was downgraded late last year, before Sunak then acknowledged failure on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe have not made enough progress,\u201d Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: \u201cYes, we have.\u201d\n\nThe shadow heath secretary, Wes Streeting, said: \u201cRishi Sunak has finally admitted what has been blatantly obvious to everyone else for years \u2013 the Conservatives have failed on the NHS.\n\n\u201cWhere Sunak has failed, Labour will succeed in getting the NHS back on its feet. We did it before and we will do it again. We will cut waiting lists with 2 million more evening and weekend appointments, paid for by abolishing the non-dom tax status.\u201d\n\nIn October, it emerged that the number of people waiting longer than 18 months for NHS treatment in England was growing. Data analysed by PA Media last month suggested that, despite recent decreases in the waiting list in England, it was still higher than when Sunak\u2019s pledge was made.\n\nThe list stood at 7.21m outstanding treatments in January 2023. In November, NHS England figures showed 7.61m treatments were yet to be carried out.\n\nNHS workers, many of whom have seen substantial pay cuts in real terms under Conservative governments, have been exercising their right to take industrial action to secure better terms.\n\nUnions have consistently said ministers could avoid strikes by offering better pay deals. And government ministers have acknowledged privately they would end up needing to do so despite having spent months publicly insisting they would take no such step.\n\nHealth leaders warned Sunak in December that allowing the industrial dispute to grind on would make delivering his pledge all but impossible. Nevertheless, Sunak sought to blame striking workers for his failure.\n\nAsked on Monday by TalkTV about the increased waiting lists in England, Sunak replied: \u201cYes, and we all know the reasons for that. And what I would say to people is: look, we have invested record amounts in the NHS: more doctors, more nurses, more scanners. All these things mean that the NHS is doing more today than it ever has been. But industrial action has had an impact.\u201d\n\nMorgan also told Sunak about his 79-year-old mother\u2019s experience with NHS care three months ago after she had a heart attack. The broadcaster said that, despite being driven to the hospital in an ambulance, his mother waited on a trolley in an A&E corridor for nearly seven hours before being seen, in a scene she compared to a \u201cwar zone\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister said the account was \u201cshocking\u201d and that performance in A&E and with ambulance waiting times were \u201cnot good enough\u201d.\n\nHowever, he denied the Tories had failed the NHS since 2010, citing the backlog created by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe can\u2019t escape that. When you shut down the country in the NHS for the best part of two years, that has had an impact on everything since then. And we just have to recognise that reality,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso during the interview, Sunak accepted a \u00a31,000 bet with Morgan that deportation flights to Rwanda would take place before the next general election, which is expected in the autumn.\n\nHe has previously set the target of sending people who arrive in the UK via unauthorised routes, including those crossing the Channel in small boats, to the east African country by the spring.\n\nThe UK has paid Rwanda \u00a3240m under Sunak\u2019s plan to \u201cstop the boats\u201d \u2013 another of his five key pledges \u2013 and ministers expect to pay an additional \u00a350m next year. But no one has yet been removed due to legal challenges that resulted in the supreme court last year finding the scheme unlawful.\n\nSunak is trying to revive the policy by passing legislation deeming Rwanda a safe country and ratifying a new treaty with Kigali. The Rwanda bill is making its way through the House of Lords.\n\nAfter shaking hands with Morgan on the terms of the Rwanda bet, Sunak said: \u201cI want to get the people on the plane. I am working incredibly hard to get the people on the planes.\u201d\n\nThe full interview is due to be shown on the Piers Morgan Uncensored YouTube channel at 2pm and TalkTV at 8pm on Monday."}

A new Pew report finds that three-fifths of parents offered their grown-up kids financial help in the past year.\n\nAsking your parents for money can become a defining moment in the parent-child relationship, for better or worse.\n\nIn the best case, it\u2019s a moment for your parents to do what parents do best, showing you their love, making your life a little bit better. In the worst case, the conversation can deteriorate into shouting and pointing, sewing rifts that may never heal.\n\nHere, from the experts, are some questions to ask before the conversation happens: Four for the child, and two for the parents.\n\nLearn more: Best debt consolidation loans\n\nHow will my parents feel about being hit up?\n\nMoney is a taboo topic in many American families. If you grew up in one that had open and honest talks about finance, then approaching them now for help may be easy.\n\nIf not, experts say, approach the conversation with care and tact.\n\n\u201cIt may feel daunting to bring up money,\u201d said Spenser Liszt, a certified financial planner in Dallas. \u201cIf this is the first time you\u2019ve ever talked about money with your parents, and you\u2019re asking for it, it could be a little bit much.\u201d\n\nCan my parents afford to give me the money?\n\nAdult children may have a hard time imagining their parents with money problems of their own. But if you\u2019re about to approach them for money, now is a good time to reflect.\n\n\u201cAre they struggling?\u201d said Laura Mattia, a certified financial planner in Sarasota, Florida. \u201cAre they concerned about health issues? Are they feeling overly generous and like they\u2019re in a good place? Because, if they\u2019re not, it\u2019s possible you could create emotional strain on them just by asking. Because they\u2019re going to want to say 'yes.'\u201d\n\nYour parents have their own retirement plan to think of, or at least they should. A large financial gift to a child could mean postponing their retirement or retiring without enough funds to cover their care. And they might not want to burden their child with that knowledge.\n\n\u201cWe have seen some parents unable to say 'no', leaving themselves compromised,\u201d Mattia said.\n\nDo I have a plan for the funds?\n\nAdult children who ask parents for money should plan for the meeting as if they were going to the bank for a loan, financial planners say.\n\nDon\u2019t just say you need money. Spell out exactly what it\u2019s for. Show that you have a well-reasoned plan for how to spend it. Demonstrate how it will help your life. Explain why you had no alternative to approaching them. Prove that you really need it.\n\n\u201cSometimes, these kids, it isn\u2019t as if they\u2019re in need. They\u2019re doctors and dentists,\u201d Mattia said. \u201cIt\u2019s not always necessarily that they need money. It\u2019s, \u2018We\u2019re thinking of buying a second house, and Mom is sitting there with the money.\u2019\u201d\n\nOptics matter. Don\u2019t ask your parents to help pay your rent, then leave the next day for Walt Disney World.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t afford your student loan payments, but your DoorDash bill is 600 bucks a month, there\u2019s a conversation that needs to be had there,\u201d said Christopher Lyman, a certified financial planner in Newtown, Pennsylvania.\n\nWill the aid cause bad blood in the family?\n\nIf you\u2019re asking your parents for $5,000, and you have three siblings, consider that all three may turn around and ask your parents for a matching sum.\n\nParenting is about fairness, financial experts say. Parents who give money to one child will be hard-pressed to explain why they aren\u2019t giving money to the siblings.\n\nLyman, the financial planner, has a client with two daughters. The mother repaid one daughter\u2019s student debt, which came to $200,000. The other daughter repaid her own student loans. Years later, the daughter who paid her own debt remains bitter that her sister got help.\n\n\u201cThe other daughter brings it up pretty regularly: \u2018Hey, I got kids. I could use a little breathing room.\u2019\u201d Lyman said.\n\nAnd now, some questions for the parents.\n\nCan I afford to help my adult child?\n\nAs parents, \u201cyou're kind of willing to do anything for your children,\u201d Liszt said.\n\nBut, before parents agree to offer financial help to a child, they need to take the measure of their own finances, advisors say.\n\n\u201cCan you afford it?\u201d said Kara Brockmeier, a certified financial planner in St. Louis. \u201cIs it a loan or a gift? Are they going to keep asking for more? Are they going to repay the loan? If they don\u2019t repay the loan, are you going to be OK with that?\u201d\n\nIf parents aren\u2019t sure about their own financial footing, they should consider consulting a financial adviser, Mattia said. Otherwise, they could risk upending their own retirement, potentially leaving them dependent on their children.\n\n\u201cNo parent wants to put themselves in a situation where now they must rely on their children in later years,\u201d she said.\n\nBoom times?Economy added 353K jobs in January, unemployment held at 3.7%.\n\nWill the aid set a bad example?\n\nParents who help an adult child need to consider how the aid will affect their financial relationship in the long term.\n\n\u201cDoes this set a precedent for them asking for more money in the future?\u201d Lyman said.\n\nIf parents agree to give an adult child money once, their approval sets the stage for the child to ask a second time. And a third.\n\n\u201cMake sure you don\u2019t become the piggy bank,\u201d Lyman said. \u201cYou\u2019re not the emergency fund. They need their own emergency fund.\u201d"}

Whether its monetary restrictions, a busy schedule or just being intimidated by the gym, there are plenty of deterrents stopping people.\n\nBut, one of TikTok's latest exercise trends is encouraging people to stay cozy and work out in their PJs while binging their favorite show.\n\nIt's no secret that exercise is good for one's health, but sometimes it can feel like too much. \"Cozy cardio\" is meant to change that.\n\nWork out ideas:Yes, exercise lowers blood pressure. This workout helps the most.\n\nInside the 'cozy cardio' workout\n\nHope Zuckerbrow begin posting \"cozy cardio\" videos in late 2022, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn one of her most popular \"cozy cardio\" videos posted in September of 2023, Zuckerbrow racked up over 96,000 likes and hundreds of comments. In it, she demonstrates her \"cozy cardio\" ritual at 5 a.m. on a \"very rainy Texas morning\" for her followers.\n\nShe starts off by filling her reusable canteen with water and making some protein coffee. Before she drinks the coffee, she eats some power protein granola bars.\n\nShe then lights a candle, turns on her Scentsy and sets up her cozy work out station.\n\nShe places her water, coffee, TV remote and walking pad remote on a stool next to her miniature treadmill coffee. She then starts and proclaims, \"The vibes are feeling good , now lets do some cardio.\"\n\nShe begins to warm up as she searches for something to watch and settles on the movie \"27 Dresses.\"\n\n\"We're going to finish our coffee and watch our movie and walk,\" she says. She walks around 1.26 miles in 30 minutes in her cozy pajamas, then hops off.\n\n@Hope_Zuckerbrow details various renditions of her \"cozy cardio\" routine on both her TikTok and Instagram pages.\n\nWhat do you need to do \"cozy cardio\"? It's meant to be simple.\n\nIn a different video, Zuckerbrow addresses the questions from folks asking what they need to get into the exercise trend.\n\nShe said that while she's grateful for the publicity that \"cozy cardio\" is receiving, people are getting some aspects of it wrong.\n\nFor the people who said they could never wake up at the crack of dawn or afford a walking pad, Zuckerbrow insists they stop using that kind of mentality.\n\nShe says you don't need a walking pad or expensive gear get into \"cozy cardio\".\n\n\"'Cozy cardio' was created to break out of the box that everybody likes to put exercise into,\" she said in a video. \"So don't put 'cozy cardio' into a box. It's important to remember that 'cozy cardio' is simply a concept.\"\n\nAccording to its creator, \"cozy cardio\" can be anything from setting up a walking pad in front of the tv and watching a movie or even binging a TV show, to completing a 30-minute cozy YouTube work out sessions.\n\n\"There [are] no rules to 'cozy cardio', there are no rules to fitness,\" said Zuckerbrow.\n\nZuckerbrow promised to post more videos featuring exercises that don't use a walking pad and don't require her followers to get up at 5 a.m.\n\nKeeping to her promise, she posted another video at the beginning of January, where she used the Peloton app for her \"cozy cardio\" that day.\n\n\u201cI get so many messages from men and women \u2013 so many people \u2013 saying something along the lines of \u2018thank you so much for kind of flipping my mindset on what I thought exercise is supposed to be,\u2019\u201d Zuckerbrow told the APP. \u201cThis feels so doable.\u201d\n\nContributing: The Associated Press"}

No deaths have been reported.\n\nAlthough tianeptine has not been approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., it is available for purchase in elixir formulations online or at gas stations, and has been informally referred to as \"gas station heroin.\"\n\nThe FDA previously said the supplement has been reported as addictive and that Neptune's Fix, a product containing the supplement, led to multiple hospitalizations.\n\nWhat is tianeptine?\n\nTianeptine is an antidepressant supplement used in Europe to treat people who respond poorly to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs, which are the most commonly prescribed medications for depression. SSRIs include brands like Zoloft, Prozac, Celexa and Lexapro.\n\nIt is not available for medical use in the U.S., Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the U.K., but it can be found in gas stations, corner stores and other convenience stores labeled as a dietary supplement.\n\nIn the U.S., several states have banned tianeptine: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee.\n\nHow to return recalled Neptune Resources products\n\nIn the recall notice, Neptune Resources said it is notifying its distributors and customers in a mailed recall letter and is arranging for the return of all recalled products. Anyone who has the recalled product should stop using it and either destroy it or return it to where it was purchased immediately.\n\nAnyone with questions regarding the recall can contact Neptune Resources at 816-256-2071 Monday-Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. CST. They also recommend consumers to contact their physician or health care provider if they have experienced any problems that may be related to using the products.\n\nContributing: Krystal Nurse, USA TODAY."}

The Dallas Mavericks acquired Kyrie Irving to put alongside Luka Doncic a year, but the Mavs didn\u2019t even make the playoffs.\n\nOver the past two decades, the trade deadline has yielded moves that helped a team win a championship:\n\nP.J. Tucker helped the Milwaukee Bucks capture the 2021 title; Marc Gasol pushed the Toronto Raptors over the top in 2019; and Rasheed Wallace propelled the Detroit Pistons to a championship in 2004.\n\nTeams are compelled to make deals for assorted reasons, and here are six teams who can\u2019t stand pat at the trade deadline:\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nWith two All-Stars in LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Lakers are a borderline play-in team. They are not a lock to make the postseason, and they expected a deep run this season after reaching the Western Conference finals in 2023 and putting together what appeared to be a solid offseason with the roster. If the Lakers want to take advantage of James playing at an All-Star level at 39 years old and Davis at an All-NBA level, they need to improve a roster that is average defensively and below average offensively. It doesn\u2019t help optics that the Los Angeles Clippers are surging and the Boston Celtics have the best record in the NBA.\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nFor the Celtics, a championship is the goal (just about) every season. They have played in the Eastern Conference finals in five of the past seven seasons and reached the Finals in 2022. But there\u2019s no title to show for it with a group led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. With Tatum, Brown, Kristaps Porzingis, Derrick White and Jrue Holiday, this might be Boston\u2019s best team of the era. And it\u2019s best chance to win a title if it can add the right player, even if it\u2019s a reserve.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nAtop the West with a 35-15 record, the young Thunder are ahead of schedule, and it\u2019s understandable if the Thunder don\u2019t want to disrupt chemistry as they try to build a sustainable team that can be near the top of the West and compete for a title the next 7-10 seasons. There\u2019s another train of thought, too. Championship windows open just as fast as they shut, and the Thunder have an opportunity now with MVP-caliber guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, star-in-the-making rookie center Chet Holmgren and outstanding second-year guard-forward Jalen Williams. If there\u2019s a move that puts the Thunder closer to a title this season, they should do it.\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nPhoenix is on the edge of a top-five seed, but not the top four. Top-heavy with talent in Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal, the Suns can use scoring help off the bench. Phoenix has the 26th -ranked bench offense, and while rotations shrink in the playoffs, having a seventh and even eighth player who can provide offense will help.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n\nThe Clippers have never been to the Finals. They\u2019ve had good teams, and in 2021, they lost to Phoenix in the Western Conference finals. Adding James Harden and Russell Westbrook to Kawhi Leonard and Paul George has put the Clippers in position to make a title push, and there\u2019s plenty to like about this team offensively and defensively. The best team in the league since Dec. 1, the Clippers have depth, but they\u2019re also looking to make a move that will better help them compete with Denver, Oklahoma City and Minnesota in the West.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks\n\nDo the Bucks have enough, even with Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard? That\u2019s a question the front office has to answer for a team that is tremendous offensively and so-so defensively. They just made a coaching change, hiring Doc Rivers to replace Adrian Griffin, who was midway through his first season as an NBA head coach. If the Bucks can find a perimeter defender, that could be their answer to a second championship in four seasons.\n\nFollow NBA reporter Jeff Zillgitt on social media @JeffZillgitt"}

Eventually the militants would attack again and Iran, Hezbollah and others would \"celebrate\" while destroying the region, Netanyahu said. Israel has estimated that Hamas had about 40,000 militants at the start of the war.\n\n\"We are on the way to total victory and I want to tell you that we are committed to it and will not give up on it,\" Netanyahu told company commanders at the Armored Corps Memorial at Latrun, 15 miles west of Jerusalem. \"We will not stop the war without achieving this goal of total victory.\"\n\nNetanyahu spoke at his Likud party\u2019s weekly faction meeting, emphasizing that cease-fire talks were continuing but that a deal is not near. Israel, he says, wants a deal similar to the one that resulted in the release of more than 100 hostages in November. But no deal for the remaining hostages will be tied to a complete withdrawal for Israeli forces from Gaza, he said.\n\n\"Hamas has demands that we will not agree to,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nDeveloping:\n\n\u220e American porn actor Whitney Wright, who advocates online for Palestinians, traveled to Iran and filmed herself throughout Tehran.

Blinken will also visit Egypt, Qatar, Israel and the West Bank before returning Thursday. His office said Blinken will continue working to prevent the war from expanding across the region and stress that the U.S. \"will take appropriate steps\" to defend its personnel and the right to freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, where Iran-backed Houthi rebels continue to wreak havoc on commercial shipping.\n\nThe trip marks Blinken's fifth visit to the region since Oct. 7, when Hamas-backed militants stormed into southern Israel on a rampage that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. More than 240 people were taken hostage as the militants fled back to Gaza. Israel's military response has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians and left much of the enclave that is home to 2 million people in ruins."}

He himself sung the Apple product's praises, lauding it as \"the single greatest piece of tech ive ever used.\"\n\n\"This feels like a little glimpse into the future,\" he says at one point.\n\nCommenters on X, though, tended to be less convinced.\n\n\"Is that even safe?

I get the use-cases for entertainment, workflow, etc but why wear them while walking around outside your home or workplace?\" one user commented.\n\nWhat are people saying on TikTok?\n\nSocial media users have been just as puzzled and skeptical on TikTok.\n\nOn TikTok, a video with 3.7 million views shared by user sanjosefoos showed a man walking across a San Jose street wearing the goggles while making indecipherable motions with his hands.\n\n\"It hasn't even been a day yet,\" read the post's caption, which was accompanied by a dead emoji and a crying emoji.\n\n\"Ready player one always seemed like a realistic possibility to me. Think about it. All of it is starting,\" one user said in a comment on the post, referencing Ernest Cline's 2011 science fiction novel about a dystopian world with virtual reality that was made into a 2018 movie by Steven Spielberg.\n\nBut not all users were so skeptical. Other commenters compared reactions to those after the release of plenty of other tech products, including Airpods and other Bluetooth-powered headphones that are now widely accepted and used.\n\n\"People made fun of AirPods when they first came out too,\" one user commented.\n\nAnother viral TikTok video re-posted by Barstool Sports shows a man riding a subway while apparently using the Vision Pro goggles to work.\n\n\"The entire train will be looking like this in 5 years,\" one user commented on the post.\n\n\"Bro is brave enough to wear something worth $3,000 in nyc transit,\" another user commented.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The ex-president of the Recording Academy (Portnow) said that if a woman wanted to be nominated they should \u2018step up\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019d like to say to him, I know you\u2019re not dead yet, but when you are, rot in piss.\u201d\n\nBridgers\u2019 brash statement sounded not so much like a middle finger to Portnow \u2013 who was recently sued for sexual assault stemming from a 2018 alleged incident \u2013 but a defiant retort to a taunting bully.\n\nBecause for all that the Grammys get wrong \u2013 just ask Jay-Z and he\u2019ll give you the list \u2013 they got a lot right Sunday.\n\nAside from participation trophies for Finneas O\u2019Connell and Jack Antonoff \u2013 with Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift, respectively \u2013 all of the nine televised awards were won by women.\n\nThe victors in the top four categories: Swift, album of the year (a record-breaking fourth win there for \u201cMidnights\u201d); Eilish, song of the year (\u201cWhat Was I Made For?\u201d); Miley Cyrus, record of the year (\u201cFlowers\u201d); Victoria Mon\u00e9t, best new artist and best R&B album (\u201cJaguar II).\u201d\n\nThey were the first Grammy wins for two of those artists despite their decade-plus careers (Mon\u00e9t\u2019s primarily as a songwriter).\n\nCyrus, a pop presence for 17 years, finally earned her inaugural trophy (best pop solo performance for \u201cFlowers\u201d) and was so elated that she threw the line, \u201cI just won my first Grammy!\u201d into her performance of the winning song. Later in the show, while accepting her prestigious record of the year win, Cyrus commented that, \u201ceveryone in this world is spectacular \u2026 please don\u2019t think (winning a Grammy) is important.\u201d\n\nThat could be easily misconstrued as Cyrus joining Drake and The Weeknd on Petulance Island, but her point wasn\u2019t about the value of the hardware.\n\n\u201cI really hope this doesn\u2019t change anything because my life was beautiful yesterday,\u201d Cyrus said, merely highlighting that while she doesn\u2019t need awards as an endorsement of her career, it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll reject the industry validation.\n\nBut these Grammys didn\u2019t only acknowledge a heartening number of women directly \u2013 more than 40 of the 94 categories by our hazy math \u2013 they rewarded persistence and spotlighted artists with massive influence appeal.\n\nKarol G became the first woman to win for best m\u00fasica urbana album (\u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito,\u201d her fourth release since 2017).\n\n\u201cI want to show girls we are made for big and great things,\u201d she said backstage.\n\nGuatemalan star Gaby Moreno told reporters, \u201cI\u2019ve been doing music for a very, very long time and I never in a million years thought I would receive recognition like this.\u201d Her win came for best Latin pop album came for \u201cX Mi (Vol. 1),\u201d the eighth release of her career.\n\nLeading nominee SZA \u2013 who entered the contest with nine \u2013 might have only triumphed in a third of her categories (including best R&B song for \u201cSnooze\u201d), but in her tearful acceptance speech, she too reminded viewers she\u2019s been in the game a minute.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, slammed with emotion. \u201cI came really, really far and I can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d\n\nThe performances at this year\u2019s Grammys swung through genres and genders \u2013 as they should \u2013 with plenty of veterans to goose interest from the AARP crowd.\n\nBilly Joel (so good to see you!), U2 (sleek, but not even the coolest drone footage could properly showcase the magic of the Sphere), Stevie Wonder (a legend saluting a legend, Tony Bennett, during the extensive in memoriam segment).\n\nBut while Joni Mitchell leveled the room with her sage reading of \u201cBoth Sides, Now\u201d and Annie Lennox captured the lilting ache of Prince\u2019s \u201cNothing Compares 2 U,\u201d performed Sinead O\u2019Connor-style also during the in memoriam, a stack of younger females dominated the stage.\n\nSure, Travis Scott, Jon Batiste, Burna Boy and Luke Combs were allowed into this year\u2019s seeming girls-club (though Combs was joined by original \u201cFast Car\u201d maven Tracy Chapman, so does that count?).\n\nBut the throughline from Dua Lipa\u2019s seductive romp on metal scaffolding to Eilish\u2019s 1960s-era headscarf Barbie tribute to Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s scarlet snarl of vindication is, happily, hope.\n\nThese are the artists we\u2019ll be seeing every couple of album cycle years just as we did when Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, Alison Krauss, Norah Jones and Alicia Keys once reigned. Though now, as exemplified Sunday, the voting members of the Recording Academy \u2013 much amplified in scope and diversity in recent years \u2013 are seemingly pursuing a range of styles to acknowledge.\n\nThose years of armfuls of trophies and headline-blasting sweeps will, like much in the music industry, morph or eventually fade.\n\nEven the more recent years of Adele, Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 the most awarded artist in Grammy history \u2013 needing a wheelbarrow to carry their gramophone gold out of the arena are dwindling.\n\nBut the women who earned their Grammys Sunday have already staked their spots.\n\nAnd no one will ever dare tell them to step up."}

Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer,\" Buckingham Palace said in a statement.\n\nCharles underwent a \"corrective procedure\" last week at The London Clinic after the palace previously announced that the monarch, 75, was seeking treatment for an enlarged prostate. His wife, Queen Camilla, told people at the private hospital that the king was \"doing well.\" His daughter-in-law, Princess Kate, was receiving care and recovering from abdominal surgery at the same facility.\n\n\"His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties. Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual,\" the palace said Monday.\n\nMore:King Charles III to undergo hospitalization for enlarged prostate, palace says\n\nThe palace's statement on Monday thanked the king's doctors for their work.\n\n\"The King is grateful to his medical team for their swift intervention, which was made possible thanks to his recent hospital procedure. He remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible,\" the palace said. \"His Majesty has chosen to share his diagnosis to prevent speculation and in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer.\"\n\nIn a Jan. 17 statement about the king's condition, the palace said, \"in common with thousands of men each year,\" Charles \"has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate.\"\n\nKing Charles was crowned at a coronation on May 6 of last year. He assumed the throne after the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II, who reigned as head royal for 70 years. In November, he celebrated his birthday, and has made state trips to Kenya and France in recent months.\n\nCharles departed from royal tradition with his openness about his prostate condition. For centuries Britain's royal family remained tight-lipped about health matters. When U.K. monarchs had real power, news of illness was withheld for fear it might weaken their authority. The habit of secrecy lingered after royals became constitutional figureheads.\n\nThe British public wasn't told that Charles' grandfather, King George VI, had lung cancer before his death in February 1952 at the age of 56. Queen Elizabeth II died of old age.\n\nWhat is an enlarged prostate and how to know warning signs?\n\nAccording to Mayo Clinic, an enlarged prostate is a common condition as men get older. By age 60, about 30% of men show moderate to severe symptoms of BPH or benign prostatic hyperplasia, the medical term for the condition. An enlarged prostate can cause a weak urine stream, a urine stream that starts and stops and frequent urination at night.\n\nThe prostate is a smaller organ that sits at the bottom of the bladder. In a man's early life, the prostate is the size of a walnut or small tangerine. But around age 50, the prostate begins to increase in size. A common treatment for prostate issues is a removal of prostate tissue.\n\nContributing: Danica Kirka, Sylvia Hui and Jill Lawless, The Associated Press"}

Cunningham then got out of the car and fled the scene.\n\nCunningham is accused of an unsuccessful carjacking attempt less than 2 miles from where Gill was shot. Police say he then approached 35-year-old Alberto Vasquez Jr. and a woman in the northeast part of the city near Union Market. He demanded Vasquez hand over his car keys, and then shot him and fled in his car. Vasquez died later at a hospital.\n\nCunningham drove Vasquez's vehicle to neighboring Prince George's County in Maryland, where police say he carried out another two carjackings and fired shots at a police cruiser while driving one of the stolen vehicles on a Maryland highway.\n\nNew Carrollton police officers spotted one of the stolen vehicles later that night parked at a location around 4 miles northeast of the Maryland-Washington border. When they got out to check the car, Cunningham approached carrying two firearms, according to the Maryland Attorney General's Office. The officers fired at him and struck him, and he died later at a hospital.\n\nGill was a St. Louis native who came to the nation's capital in 1993 after graduating from the University of Dayton, his wife, Kristina Gill, wrote in a statement. He served three terms on the D.C. Board of Elections and coached youth soccer, she said.\n\n\"Mike was not only a devoted husband and father but also a cherished son, brother, and friend,\" she said. \"Over the course of his remarkable life, Mike brought people together and made them feel included, supported, and loved.\"\n\nAt the time of his death, Gill served as a senior vice president of the Housing Policy Center, a trade association.\n\n\"No words can express the depth of sympathy we feel for Mike and his family,\" Housing Policy Center President Ed DeMarco said in a statement. \"Our thoughts are with his wife Kristina and their three children, Sean, Brian, and Annika, his mother, and siblings as they deal with this tragic loss.\"\n\nMore:As Washington crime spikes, DOJ vows to send more resources to reeling city\n\nCarjackings spike in nation's capital\n\nGill's death comes amidst a wave of violent car theft in Washington that saw carjackings nearly double in 2023, as compared with the year before.\n\nThe carjacking spike drew national attention after Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar and an FBI agent had their cars stolen by armed suspects within a two-month period last fall.\n\nThe FBI confirmed that one of its agents was carjacked by two armed assailants on Nov. 29. A 17-year-old was later arrested in connection with the incident.\n\nCuellar's car was stolen by three armed suspects on Oct. 2 from a location near the Capitol building. Police have not announced arrests in the case.\n\nCybele Mayes-Osterman is a breaking news reporter for USA Today. Reach her by email at cmayesosterman@usatoday.com. Follow her on X @CybeleMO."}

A much-ballyhooed convoy of MAGA patriots descended on a town near the southern border, ostensibly ready to protect America from what right-wing politicians like Gov. Greg Abbott cynically, dangerously and falsely call \u201can invasion.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGod\u2019s Army\u201d convoy was supposed to be a mighty force of 700,000 or more people from every corner of America. It wound up being maybe a couple hundred vehicles parked at a rural ranch in Quemado, Texas \u2013 basically a Trump rally without a Trump, but with plenty of hucksters selling MAGA merch and grifting the easily grifted.\n\nMAGA was promised a Texas border 'invasion,' but it wasn't there\n\nSome actually visited the border in nearby Eagle Pass, Texas, and were surprised to not witness the invasion they had been promised.\n\nConvoy-goer Misty Gregory told MSNBC: \u201cIt\u2019s not what I expected, but then again I don\u2019t know what I expected. I can tell you it\u2019s not as bad as what I thought, so that\u2019s kind of eye-opening in itself.\u201d\n\nAbbott and about a dozen other pro-razor-wire GOP governors were in Eagle Pass on Sunday, hollering and whatnot. Some residents said the recent invasion of Trump supporters from the convoy had been downright scary.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly being told that we\u2019re being invaded, and that never felt true until today, when the convoy came to town in anticipation of the governors\u2019 event,\u201d Jessie F. Fuentes told WOAI NBC News Channel 4. \u201cThis is political theater by outsiders. The reality is that it has brought dangerous, violent groups into our beautiful, peaceful city. Eagle Pass is safer than most cities in America if you look at crime statistics. This is just a fact. We don\u2019t appreciate these staged events that dramatically misrepresent our reality on the border and that invite extremist groups that pose a real danger to people in our community.\u201d\n\nIn Texas, the MAGA movement again reveals its impotence\n\nSo God\u2019s Army's foot soldiers came, in underwhelming numbers, and accomplished little beyond showing everyone how tragically gullible they are and making the locals twitchy. That\u2019s MAGA in a nutshell: loud, threatening and, in the end, impotent.\n\nTrump won the presidency in 2016, and he hasn\u2019t won a thing since. He\u2019s the face of this supposedly forceful political movement, but the movement mirrors its creator, a loudmouth con artist who overpromises and rarely delivers a thing.\n\nThe wall? Mexico paying for the wall? The border crisis fixed? Nope, nope and nope.\n\nWhy politicians take action:Fixing the border crisis is bad for Trump and good for Biden. That's the problem.\n\nThe 'God's Army' convoy, like all things MAGA, was a grift\n\nMAGA is and always has been a con to line the pockets of Trump and others who saw a swath of Americans waiting to be fleeced. The fact that our border is not now lined with big, strong, gun-toting patriots willing to defend America at all costs is not surprising.\n\nMAGA says: \u201cWE ARE COMING BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS!\u201d Then MAGA delivers a crowd that resembles a small county fair on a slow day, populated by a mix of conspiracy theorists, angry xenophobes and slightly befuddled hangers-on who didn\u2019t get what they were promised.\n\nBipartisan border bill shows actual attempt to address crisis\n\nOn Sunday in Washington, D.C., a bipartisan Senate bill to address the border crisis was released. It\u2019s a serious piece of legislation that includes about $20 billion in border funds. It deserves strong consideration, but the Trump loyalists in the House have already declared it dead on arrival.\n\nAfter the Senate bill was released, President Joe Biden said: \u201cThe United States Senate has done the hard work it takes to reach a bipartisan agreement. Now, House Republicans have to decide. Do they want to solve the problem? Or do they want to keep playing politics with the border?\u201d\n\nOh, they\u2019ll definitely want to keep playing politics with the border. Because that\u2019s what Trump \u2013 the MAGA king \u2013 has told them to do.\n\nPeople treat MAGA like an unstoppable force, but it's not\n\nBut they are being cowed by a weenie movement that\u2019s all smoke and mirrors. There are loud influencers who puff up the strength of MAGA, and there are, sadly, many in the political press who buy in and amplify that belief.\n\nBut MAGA, at least since Trump first took office, has been a losing movement. It\u2019s not unstoppable. It\u2019s not a 700,000-person convoy of devoted citizen soldiers descending on Texas in a show of force.\n\nBiden's woke economy:True MAGA patriots must remove themselves from Biden\u2019s booming economy, cash out 401(k)s\n\nIt\u2019s a comically disorganized and useless parade of con artists and the conned, drifting from one apocalyptic grievance to the next.\n\nThe border is a serious issue. But God\u2019s Army and Trump and his slavish enablers in the House are not serious people.\n\nMAGA, for all its bluster, is a joke without a punchline. The sooner people recognize that the better.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on X, formerly Twitter, @RexHuppke and Facebook facebook.com/RexIsAJerk"}

To date, this hasn\u2019t really happened. Over the course of the 2016 Republican primaries, it was often assumed that Trump would flame out, that one of his controversial comments would prove too controversial and his political ambitions would be shattered. His competitors spent inordinate amounts of time and money assuming this would happen, and then it didn\u2019t.\n\nSo then it was assumed that he would at least get chewed up by Hillary Clinton in the general election, which he didn\u2019t \u2014 at least, not in three swing states that gave him his electoral college majority. So then the assumption transitioned to exogenous legal forces: Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe or maybe impeachment would lead to his ouster. Nope.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2020, the thing that derailed Trump was largely Trump: He was unpopular and his presidency was viewed broadly negatively. He lost to Joe Biden, with many of Biden\u2019s voters indicating that their vote was less about the Democrat than the incumbent Republican.\n\nThen 2023 arrived and Trump sought a comeback. Over the past 14 months or so, Trump\u2019s held a lead in the Republican nominating contest \u2014 so much so that by last fall, it seemed pretty obvious that he would be the party\u2019s nominee. But there were reasons to be cautious. After all, who knows! Something could happen.\n\nUnlike in 2016, this \u201csomething\u201d was often identifiable: The various indictments Trump faces could culminate in a conviction, potentially upending the primary fight. This wasn\u2019t an irrational assumption, given that the indictments loomed and the repercussions of them were uncertain. But no conviction emerged and, as of writing, Trump\u2019s renomination is a near certainty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo we start the whole thing over. Yes, Trump leads in many polls of the general election, like one from NBC News released Sunday. But maybe Trump will be convicted of a crime, damaging his position \u2014 like in the NBC News poll released Sunday.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nMaybe. Maybe not.\n\nIt is unquestionably useful that NBC News\u2019s pollsters asked the question. (Specifically: \u201cIf Donald Trump is found guilty and convicted this year of a felony,\u201d how would respondents vote?) NBC\u2019s Mark Murray broke out some of the demographic shifts that resulted, comparing initial responses to the who-would-you-vote-for question with the if-indicted version.\n\nOverall, there was a 7-point shift in the margin from Trump to Biden. Among younger voters, the shift was 15 points; among Latinos and independents, it was 11 points. Even among Republicans, the poll measured a 7-point drop in support for Trump should he be convicted of a felony this year.\n\nIn his write-up, though, Murray noted an important asterisk identified by one of the pollsters involved in the survey. The independents who shifted away from Trump in the post-conviction question, he wrote, \u201chold overwhelmingly negative opinions about Biden, and they also prefer a Republican-controlled Congress by more than 60 points.\u201d It seems unlikely that this constitutes a certain, hard shift to Biden\u2019s advantage. It indicates, instead, a shift from Trump support to supporting neither candidate at all.\n\nWe should consider this in the context of another element of the NBC News polling. Over the course of the past eight months, the network\u2019s polling has gone from showing a 4-point Biden advantage to a 5-point Trump one. That shift, though, is largely a function of declining support for Biden rather than growing support for Trump.\n\nOther polls have shown similarly that Trump\u2019s improved position against Biden is often due to Biden\u2019s softening support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we overlay this with polling (including NBC\u2019s) showing that Biden backers are again often centered on opposition to Trump, we can generate a reasonable theory. Biden voters aren\u2019t thrilled about him but often choose him as an alternative to Trump. When Trump\u2019s negative characteristics aren\u2019t salient \u2014 as when the economy or immigration are focal points of the campaign, both issues on which Trump fares well relative to Biden \u2014 some of Biden\u2019s support fades. Presented with a starkly negative scenario for Trump, though, it resolidifies.\n\nWhether Trump is convicted of a felony before the election remains to be seen. It is probably not the case that his D.C. trial centered on efforts to subvert the 2020 election will conclude by then, given that it is currently on hold pending a Supreme Court decision. (In a new CNN-SSRS poll, about half of respondents said it was \u201cessential\u201d this trial be resolved before November.) He may be convicted elsewhere, like in New York City \u2014 where he faces charges that many view as less concerning.\n\nIt is easy to be cynical here, certainly, and assume that even a federal conviction on charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith wouldn\u2019t have much effect on Trump\u2019s support. The past eight years have certainly offered plenty of reasons to make such an assumption.\n\nBut a conviction might actually have a negative effect on Trump, if only somewhat indirectly: giving voters who don\u2019t love either candidate a reason to go out and cast a ballot for Biden \u2014 and making some Trump voters less likely to show up to vote."}

Pasta is quick to cook, handy to keep in the pantry and an easy solution for the times when you\u2019re not sure what to make for dinner. But because pasta is high in carbohydrates \u2014 and therefore, some people think, bad for your weight and your health \u2014 it often doesn\u2019t make it onto the menu.\n\n\u201cPasta isn\u2019t deserving of its rep as a fattening food,\u201d says Erin Morse, the chief clinical dietitian at UCLA Health Center. Nor are carbohydrates in general. In a 2018 study in the Lancet, researchers projected that a 50-year-old who got half their calories from carbohydrates would live four years longer than someone on a low-carb diet (less than 30 percent of calories) and one year longer than someone on a higher-carb diet (more than 65 percent of calories).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nServing up pasta\u2019s health benefits\n\nRegular pasta is made from refined flour that\u2019s stripped of its fiber-rich outer layers. But the flour (called semolina) comes from durum wheat, which is higher in protein than other varieties. \u201cMany pastas on the market are also enriched with iron and B vitamins,\u201d says Dolores Woods, a registered dietitian at UTHealth Houston School of Public Health. A cup of cooked pasta serves up 8 grams of protein and 2.5 grams of fiber, plus 26 percent of the daily value for folate and 10 percent for iron \u2014 all for just 220 calories.\n\nPasta has some important differences from other refined carbs. The starches and protein in durum wheat are bound together, so it takes longer for your body to digest. \u201cPasta can help you feel fuller than white rice or white bread,\u201d says Mengxi Du, a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. It also has a lower glycemic index, or GI \u2014 a measure of how quickly a food raises your blood sugar \u2014 than other refined carbs. Blood sugar levels stay steadier, which has benefits for your weight and health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, in a study published in 2016 in the journal Nutrition & Diabetes, people who ate pasta as part of a Mediterranean diet had lower body mass indexes and smaller waistlines than those who also followed a Mediterranean diet but did not eat pasta. And a large 2021 study in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Healthy found that women ages 50 to 79 who ate pasta three to four times a week were 16 percent less likely to have a stroke and 9 percent less likely to develop heart disease than those who ate it less than once a week.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe BMJ study was partially funded by the pasta industry, which means more research is needed. Nevertheless, pasta can be part of a healthy diet, and it\u2019s better for you than fried potatoes and white bread, so swapping it in can benefit your health, Morse says. It\u2019s often paired with healthy foods, too, such as olive oil and vegetables.\n\nHere are some tips for keeping pasta healthy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeasure portions. A serving of pasta is 2 ounces dry, or about 1 cup cooked. \u201cIt depends on the shape of the pasta, so it\u2019s smart to measure it,\u201d Morse says. If you\u2019re eyeballing it, a cup of cooked pasta is roughly the size of a baseball.\n\nDon\u2019t overcook. That breaks the bonds between the protein and starch. They remain intact in firm noodles, called al dente, Du says. This keeps the pasta\u2019s GI low and helps you feel satisfied for longer. Cooking times vary, so check packages.\n\nAdd veggies. This increases the fiber and nutrients. \u201cBlend steamed carrots, broccoli, bell peppers or leafy greens into your red sauce,\u201d Morse says. Or try asparagus, peas, zucchini, peppers, mushrooms and a drizzle of olive oil. You can also swap out half the pasta for \u201cnoodles\u201d cut from fresh squash or another vegetable, Du says. Or simply warm up frozen veggies with your sauce and use it to top the pasta.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToss in some filling protein. Cooked lean meat, poultry, fish, beans or tofu can help make one serving of pasta more satisfying.\n\nChoose a low-sodium sauce. A half-cup of tomato sauce counts as a serving of vegetables in your diet. Jarred sauces are often high in sodium; several of the ones in our 2023 pasta sauce test had 420 mg per serving. That\u2019s 20 percent of the 2,300-mg daily limit. The two top-rated (by Consumer Reports) sauces, the Silver Palate Low Sodium Marinara and Victoria Low Sodium Marinara, have only around 5 percent of the daily limit.\n\nCopyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc."}

James Lankford (R-Okla.) predicted what would happen when the actual text of the deal was released and they were proved wrong.\n\n\u201cNone of those folks are going to look at it and come to the press and apologize,\u201d Lankford said last week. \u201cThey\u2019ll find something different.\u201d\n\nThe text of the bill was released Sunday night. It doesn\u2019t support Trump allies\u2019 claims. And not only are they not apologizing; they\u2019ve ramped up the rhetoric in stunning ways, with some falsely labeling the bill \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\nThe almost instantaneous pushback from the congressional right Sunday night was a sight to behold. Despite Lankford\u2019s helping to craft a bill that his Senate GOP allies have labeled a remarkably conservative one \u2014 one that is certainly more conservative than other recent immigration efforts, in that it includes no new protections for undocumented people already in the country \u2014 plenty of Republicans quickly served notice that they will go to great lengths to kill it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the counterfactual claims they made certainly bolster the argument, as Lankford and others have posited, that they would rather not pass anything in this election year, when the border crisis is bolstering Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 hopes.\n\n\u201cAmnesty\u201d was the watchword Sunday night. It was invoked by scores of House Republicans and some GOP senators. Rep. Mary E. Miller (R-Ill.) said, \u201cThe Senate AMNESTY bill erases our borders.\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) wagered that anyone who voted for the \u201copen border amnesty bill must be paid off by foreign interests and is acting as a foreign agent.\u201d Donald Trump Jr. used the a-word in four consecutive posts on X.\n\nThe core of the argument is that the deal mandates a shutdown of the border once there is a daily average of 5,000 border apprehensions in one week. Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and many others have suggested that this amounts to proactively allowing that number in. Some have extrapolated it to suggest that the bill greenlights 1.8 million people over the course of a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) invoked the 5,000 number late Sunday while saying flatly that the House won\u2019t vote on the deal. He claimed it \u201caccepts 5,000 illegal immigrants a day.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThis is false. That\u2019s merely the point at which a very restrictive process kicks in (it would also kick in if crossings reach 8,500 in a single day). At that point, no new asylum claims from those apprehended would be considered, and anybody caught crossing the border would be removed.\n\nThe key here is that, under existing law, those apprehended right now must go through a process as long as they make it to U.S. soil. If they claim asylum, that must be considered. They can\u2019t instantly be deported. And even under the current system, as Glenn Kessler reported in The Fact Checker, in the past six years, fewer than 15 in 100 people who claimed asylum were ultimately granted it, according to the Justice Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bill also makes that asylum process quicker and more difficult. It raises the standard for those claiming that they face a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of persecution in their home country and requires them to show they couldn\u2019t simply move somewhere else. It aims to ensure that their cases are decided within months rather than the current average of years, in part by empowering U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to make decisions \u2014 rather than backlogged federal immigration courts.\n\nThe word \u201camnesty\u201d gets thrown around a lot by border hawks whenever there is a significant effort at immigration reform. But rarely has it been so overextended.\n\nOne could argue that the Senate bill doesn\u2019t go far enough in cracking down on abuses of the asylum system. But that\u2019s not really the argument being made; instead, the suggestion is that the bill would somehow actually be a boon to those who would cross the border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that the rhetoric so quickly went there after the release of the bill would seem to reinforce the idea that Republicans have buyer\u2019s remorse about asking for changes to immigration law as part of a deal to send more money to Ukraine. They\u2019ve spent years asking for a tightening of asylum rules, including in recent years during the Biden administration. But when it looked like Lankford and the Senate were about to actually produce that, the critics set about moving the goal posts. Suddenly, those new immigration laws weren\u2019t really even needed \u2014 just a president with the will to enforce the existing laws. (Never mind that Trump himself asked for such changes during his own \u201ccrisis\u201d as president.)\n\nThat highly expedient shift was telling, and the building push to label the bill amnesty is certainly of a piece."}

Like many colleges, Dartmouth dropped its standardized-test requirement for applicants when the rapid spread of the coronavirus disrupted testing nationally. Admissions were test-optional for a few years, meaning students could decide whether to submit scores.\n\nBut after studying the impact of testing on admissions and as a predictor of student success, Dartmouth officials decided to reinstate the requirement that students provide an SAT or ACT score when they apply.\n\nSian Leah Beilock, Dartmouth\u2019s president, wrote in an email to students Monday that they found that SAT and ACT scores \u201ccan be especially helpful in identifying students from less-resourced backgrounds who would succeed at Dartmouth but might otherwise be missed in a test-optional environment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmissions offices at selective schools typically consider many factors in assessing students, including the academic rigor and grades of an applicant\u2019s high school classes, as well as essays, recommendations, and activities the student has pursued outside of class. For many years, test scores were part of that package, until the public health emergency scrambled things.\n\nFour Dartmouth professors studied admissions data from years when tests were optional and years when they were required, as well as other analyses, and concluded that the scores \u2014 when considered in the context of the norms of the applicant\u2019s high school \u2014 were helpful.

And they were especially helpful in identifying applicants who were the first in their family to go to college, those from low- or middle-income families, and those from rural and urban areas.\n\n\u201cOur bottom line is simple: we believe a standardized testing requirement will improve \u2014 not detract from \u2014 our ability to bring the most promising and diverse students to our campus,\u201d Lee Coffin, Dartmouth\u2019s vice president and dean of admissions and financial aid, wrote in announcing the change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe finding that standardized testing can be an effective tool to expand access and identify talent was unexpected, thought-provoking, and encouraging,\u201d Coffin wrote. \u201cIndeed, their study challenges the long-standing critique that standardized testing inhibits rather than broadens college access.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cSAT and ACT scores reflect inequality in society and in educational systems across the nation. The research does not dispute that,\u201d Beilock wrote. \u201cCrucially, though, the research shows that standardized test scores can be an important predictor of academic success at a place like Dartmouth and beyond \u2014 more so even than just grades or recommendations, for example \u2014 and with a test-optional policy, prompted by the pandemic, we were unintentionally overlooking applicants from less-resourced backgrounds who could thrive here.\u201d"}

Bartiromo has cemented her position as one of the most sycophantic members of the pro-Trump media, with even one of her colleagues at one point warning that right-wing conspiracy theorists had her ear. (With good reason.) So Sunday\u2019s conversation between the two on Bartiromo\u2019s ostensibly business-focused Fox News show \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d was what you would expect: an assemblage of the standard claims and fictions and hyperbole from Trump interrupted occasionally by prods from Bartiromo.\n\nFor example: \u201cWe\u2019re letting 18 million people in,\u201d Trump said at one point, offering a wildly inflated estimate of the number of immigrants allowed to stay in the United States under President Biden. \u201cI think the number is going to be 18 million people by the time he gets out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Bartiromo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so it went. There were some awkward edits in the broadcast where Trump undoubtedly started riffing about how the 2020 election was stolen, a topic that Fox News has learned the hard way not to put on the air. But otherwise it was what you\u2019d expect.\n\nListening to the patter \u2014 the indescribably familiar patter of Trump talking about the things Trump wants to talk about \u2014 the effect of his approach is clear: It\u2019s another example of how Trump overwhelms systems that would otherwise be a political disadvantage for him.\n\nSimply by virtue of saying the same things over and over, Trump didn\u2019t make much news. He did suggest that he would be happy to see Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel go, and \u2014 with unsubtle prods from Bartiromo \u2014 acknowledged that some of the obvious contenders for his possible future vice-presidential pick were contenders for that pick. Beyond that? Same old. The news is about what\u2019s new, and Trump specializes in offering anything but that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet here it was, mostly unfiltered for half an hour on Fox News. Here he was talking about how foreign governments were putting criminals in caravans and sending them north, just as he had said when he first announced his candidacy in 2015. Talking about how the situation at the border meant there was a \u201c100 percent\u201d chance of a future terrorist attack, while claiming no such attacks had occurred when he was president. (They did.) Asserting that, if he were president, the Chinese would never have sent a balloon over the United States (they reportedly did) and that U.S. service members would never have been killed in Jordan.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nTrump even had the temerity to suggest that the rampant turnover he saw in his administration was a sign of success and strength, akin to \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d (His analogy, not mine.) According to Trump, he did and would have done everything perfectly; Biden does and will continue to do everything awfully.\n\nBartiromo just nodded along, occasionally asking things like whether Chinese immigrants arriving at the border were \u201cbeing directed by the Communist Party to come here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not a new observation that Trump wears down opposition through repetition. He says things that were once considered beyond the pale so often that people become acclimated to them, if not accepting of them. The effect is that he says them to those who are listening \u2014 his base of support and those still curious enough to pay attention \u2014 as fact checks and rebuttals and context become more and more stale.\n\nThe Washington Post invented a new category of fact-checking for Trump since he says the same false things so often, but who has the energy to get up every day and tell people who don\u2019t care that Trump once again is being dishonest?\n\nParticularly in the wake of the 2020 election, there was a push within the media to more actively ensure that Trump wasn\u2019t able to simply make false claims (particularly about election fraud) to viewers and readers. MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes recently suggested that this impulse has gone too far, that Americans are being shielded from seeing Trump\u2019s more reactionary and aggressive rhetoric about governance and policy. That will probably change as the campaign progresses, but it\u2019s an interesting point: Many people don\u2019t know just how extreme Trump\u2019s argumentation has gotten.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t gloss over the \u201cwho don\u2019t care\u201d qualifier above, though. Maria Bartiromo doesn\u2019t seem to care that Trump is saying false things; she doesn\u2019t even seem to care that he\u2019s saying the same false things he always says, limiting the ostensible news utility of this interview. But that\u2019s not why she\u2019s talking to him, because that\u2019s not what his supporters want.\n\nTrump went from being a right-wing-outrage cover band in 2015 and 2016 to having his own catalogue of hits by 2020. Now he\u2019s just the popular act that does the same numbers over and over to people who follow him from show to show like he\u2019s Jimmy Buffett. (This is at times literal; his rallies feature groupies who follow him from town to town and get seats right up front.) If you dislike the music, you\u2019re not going to check out the concert.\n\nThe result is that people who tune in to his interviews or watch Fox News or obsess over the former president hear this same litany of claims over and over without context or pushback. Traditional media does offer some context, at times, but doing so in the same way repeatedly is resource intensive, and the people who are actively tuning in to Trump aren\u2019t likely to flip over to The Washington Post afterward to see how he is misleading them. What\u2019s in effect at Fox is the opposite pattern to the one Hayes is focused on: On Fox, Trump is covered relentlessly, and what\u2019s muted is criticism."}

Vance would have upended democracy over right-wing nonsense", "domain": "washingtonpost.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBwgKMI7UlAowt9F0", "text": "You\u2019re not going to trip up Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) by presenting him with his past disparagements of Donald Trump. Vance has spent years reframing those comments, as when he said that Trump was \u201cleading our political discourse to a very negative place.\u201d His spin is that he was wrong and Trump\u2019s presidency was great, and that was enough to get Trump to endorse him in 2022 and propel him to his current position.\n\nWell, that and a repeated willingness to embrace Trump\u2019s rhetoric, no matter how negative the place where Vance later ends up. As when he said during an interview Sunday that he would have done exactly what Trump wanted on Jan. 6, 2021, and blocked electors from states that voted for Joe Biden \u2014 triggering a dangerous challenge to American democracy.\n\nVance was speaking with ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, who seemed to be focused on testing the limits of the senator\u2019s loyalty to Trump. If there\u2019s a limit, Stephanopoulos didn\u2019t find it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked, for example, how he felt about Trump\u2019s having been found liable for sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll, one of many women who have accused Trump of misconduct, Vance waved it away.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s actually very unfair to the victims of sexual assault,\u201d Vance said, \u201cto say that somehow their lives are being worse by electing Donald Trump for president, when what he\u2019s trying to do, I think is restore prosperity.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of future economic benefit may not be the consolation for assault victims that Vance assumes.\n\nVance also disparaged the verdict, suggesting that New York is one of several \u201cextremely left-wing jurisdictions\u201d where Trump is facing charges, implying that this was a stacking of the deck against Trump instead of a result of his alleged crimes while he lived in those jurisdictions. The argument that a jury would rule against Trump simply because of politics, of course, is of a piece with the prevalent idea on the right that Democrats are members of a credulous hive mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(As an aside, the senator\u2019s effusive disparagement of wealthy donors bankrolling aggressive legal fights may not land well with his primary political patron, Peter Thiel.)\n\nStephanopoulos then asked Vance about the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cHad you been vice president on January 6th,\u201d the ABC anchor asked, \u201cwould you have certified the election results?\u201d\n\nThis is what Trump insisted Vice President Mike Pence not do on that day, asking Pence to instead reject electoral votes submitted by states that preferred Biden. Eventually, Vance said that\u2019s what he would have done.\n\n\u201cIf I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThat is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not a legitimate way to do so, at all. Particularly when considering the purported \u201cproblems\u201d that Vance identified.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cDo I think it was a problem that big technology companies, working with the intelligence services, censored the presidential campaign of Donald Trump? Yes,\u201d he said at another point in the interview. \u201cDo I think it\u2019s a problem that Pennsylvania changed its balloting rules in the middle of the election season in a way that even some courts in Pennsylvania have said was illegal? Yes, I think these were problems, George.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s deal with the second one first. Pennsylvania expanded voting access to allow more mail-in ballots before 2020, yes. But it did so in 2019, before the pandemic, with legislation passed by the Republican-majority legislature. Republicans tried to challenge those changes, arguing that they violated the state constitution, and a lower court in early 2022 ruled that the changes did violate the state constitution. But that ruling was overturned by the state Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in fact, had considered the question in November 2020. Its chief justice, Thomas Saylor, pointed out that even if the law were unconstitutional, \u201cthere has been too much good-faith reliance, by the electorate, on the no-excuse mail-in voting regime created by [the law] to warrant judicial consideration of the extreme and untenable remedies proposed by appellees.\u201d In other words: People had already voted by the millions under the law, so even if it shouldn\u2019t have been in place, those legal votes should not be tossed out.\n\nWhich is what Vance argues: Because the rules were changed (over a year before the election), those voters (most of whom would probably have otherwise gone to vote against Trump in person) should have their opinions disregarded. Since, you know, that was a \u201cproblem.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s other argument is no less contrived. He\u2019s regurgitating a common right-wing claim that the government pressured social media companies to block online information. More accurately, he\u2019s exaggerating that common claim to suggest that Trump\u2019s campaign was targeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe short version of all of this goes as follows. Elon Musk, believing rhetoric that Twitter (now X) sought to crack down on right-wing accounts and viewpoints, stumbled into buying the company. He turned over internal material to writers motivated to similarly believe that originating rhetoric and, in December 2022, they began producing cherry-picked documents to suggest that the government told the social media site to silence right-wing voices. This included muffling coverage of Hunter Biden in October 2020, an event that has been overhauled in the right\u2019s collective memory to have been determinative in the election results. (It was not.)\n\nThe reality is that the government sought the help of social media companies in halting misinformation about voting and about the coronavirus pandemic. Given that Russian hackers had been the trigger for the wide release of stolen information in 2016 in an effort to swing that election, there were also conversations about being alert to potential foreign-interference efforts. When the Hunter Biden story broke only weeks before Election Day, it was (briefly) muted out of concern it was a similar effort.\n\nLawyers for X have acknowledged that Vance\u2019s framing is incorrect. But consider what he\u2019s arguing: that because some X accounts were muted for spreading misinformation or (again, briefly) for sharing the Hunter Biden story, the results in several states that backed Biden should be rejected?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s more, that they should have been rejected for that reason in January 2021 \u2014 nearly two years before these dubious or debunked allegations were even made?\n\nThat\u2019s the giveaway, really. Vance isn\u2019t saying there were problems that necessitated reconsidering the 2020 election results, giving Trump a second term in office. What\u2019s he\u2019s saying \u2014 and what Trump has done all along \u2014 is that he wishes Trump had a second term in office, which came down to the Jan. 6 counting of electoral votes, and so he offers some after-the-fact rationalizations for why that would have been okay."}

To a greater extent than perhaps any other moment since the 1920 debate over U.S. entry into the League of Nations, this country\u2019s role in the world will be on the ballot. At the same time, the United States faces critical global challenges in Ukraine, the Middle East, East Asia and elsewhere.\n\nAssuming they do end up facing each other in November, Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump will offer voters a stark choice between the former\u2019s support for the network of alliances and international institutions the United States helped create after World War II and the latter\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach. In that sense, U.S. voters will not be choosing a direction for their country alone but for the world as a whole.\n\nFollow this author Editorial Board 's opinions Follow\n\nThe assumption underlying such institutions as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the mutual defense agreements that bind the United States with Japan and South Korea is that security is not a zero-sum proposition. By committing resources over extended periods and combining them, taking mutual advantage of differing capabilities, countries can make themselves far safer than would have been possible if they acted unilaterally or in temporary concert. Mr. Biden believes this is still a workable model, which is why he is trying to apply and expand it to deter the challenge to NATO posed by Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Trump, by contrast, has repeatedly depicted security alliances not as prudent long-term investments but as free rides for allies who get U.S. protection but do not shoulder their fair share of the defense burden. This is why Mr. Trump is pushing to end America\u2019s support for Ukraine and hinting at a separate peace of some kind with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. His campaign website promises \u201cfundamentally reevaluating NATO\u2019s purpose and NATO\u2019s mission.\u201d\n\nSelf-absorbed and easily swayed by honeyed words and calculated attention from autocrats such as North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, he inconsistently directs venom at China\u2019s predatory trade practices and admiration for that country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping. This sows uncertainty not just in Taiwan but also the wider range of allies and partners that includes Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia and India. The Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy, has warned that a Trump return would raise foundational questions about America\u2019s trustworthiness as well as \u201cthe credibility of its commitments to foreign partners, and the durability of its role as the [linchpin] of the global security order.\u201d We wish it were exaggerating.\n\nWe say this in full awareness of the fact that Mr. Biden\u2019s record is hardly perfect. Also, there are weaknesses in the U.S.-sponsored global security and economic architecture, such as the European allies\u2019 neglect of military contributions to NATO and China\u2019s mercantilist exploitation of its membership in the World Trade Organization. Mr. Trump has exploited these valid issues, albeit by exaggerating them. But if his harsh words helped force Europe to boost spending, well and good. In the case of trade, there is less disagreement between him and Mr. Biden than there is on alliances and security \u2014 unfortunately. Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist bent actually represents a point of convergence between him and the president who has, alas, maintained many of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs and even alienated European allies by using subsidies designed to steer green energy investment to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of America First is ascendant within the GOP but not unanimous. Nikki Haley, former ambassador to the U.N. and governor of South Carolina, is still running against him and speaking for the Republican Party\u2019s internationalist wing. Most Senate Republicans still support Ukraine. Part of what\u2019s so concerning about the prospect of an isolationist second Trump presidency is that it would defy majority sentiment: Sixty-five percent of Americans want the United States to play a \u201cleading\u201d or \u201cmajor\u201d role in world affairs, according to the most recent Gallup Poll."}

Yet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still has failed to articulate a viable \u201cday after\u201d strategy for what happens if and when the guns fall silent. His latest dereliction may consign the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip to failure despite the bravery and dedication of ordinary Israeli soldiers.\n\nWhile much of the media coverage focuses on the heavy casualties suffered by the Palestinian civilians that Hamas uses as human shields, the Israel Defense Forces are also inflicting heavy losses on Hamas fighters. According to the Wall Street Journal, U.S. intelligence estimates that the IDF has killed 20 percent to 30 percent of Hamas\u2019s prewar strength of roughly 30,000 combatants and wounded roughly another 30 percent. (Israel\u2019s figures for Hamas casualties are slightly higher.)\n\nAny conventional military force that has suffered such heavy casualties would be rendered \u201ccombat ineffective.\u201d But Hamas is continuing to wage guerrilla warfare against Israeli forces, and its command structure remains intact. While Israel has killed many lower-level commanders, it has not yet located Hamas\u2019s senior leaders, including Yehiya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who is believed to be hiding in the tunnels under his hometown, Khan Younis. The IDF has discovered that Hamas\u2019s tunnel network is even more extensive than suspected \u2014 and as much as 80 percent of the tunnels remain intact despite months of bombardment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are even reports of Hamas militants returning to areas in northern Gaza where Israel has reduced its forces in the past month. Hamas could actually wind up inadvertently benefiting from Israel\u2019s heavy bombardment: The terrorist group has figured out how to turn unexploded Israeli ordnance into its own bombs and missiles.\n\n\u201cIsrael has been highly successful in degrading Hamas militarily and must complete the work in the two remaining areas of Gaza: Khan Younis and Rafah,\u201d Chuck Freilich, a former Israeli deputy national security adviser, told me. \u201cIt has been far less successful in undermining Hamas\u2019s control as the ruling body in Gaza.\u201d\n\nFollow this author Max Boot 's opinions Follow\n\nSo where does the Israeli operation go from here? Retired Israeli army Col. Michael Milshtein, a former head of Palestinian affairs for military intelligence, told me Israel is at a crossroads: \u201cIt must either promote a broad deal regarding the hostages, which means the end of the war and probably withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, or implement the strategic goal of erasing Hamas military capacities, which demands full control over Gaza.\u201d The \u201cin-between strategy,\u201d he added, \u201cisn\u2019t successful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet that neither-fish-nor-fowl strategy is just what Netanyahu is pursuing. While Israeli forces continue to fight in Gaza, the Israeli government is deep in talks in Paris in the hope of reaching another hostage release deal with Hamas. The two sides are discussing a cease-fire of at least one to two months and the release of many convicted Palestinian terrorists in Israel in return for the return of all the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza. Hamas is demanding that Israel end its offensive altogether, while Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing cabinet allies are opposed to any extended pause. Netanyahu is trying to square that circle.\n\nWhatever happens with the cease-fire, the Israeli end game in Gaza remains as opaque as when the war began. Quite simply, Netanyahu refuses to lay out any day-after strategy because to do so is too politically risky for him. The United States and its Arab allies are urging Israel to involve the Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza and to create a road map for Palestinian statehood. But the far-right parties that keep Netanyahu in power are dead-set against a two-state solution or any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s right-wing allies prefer an Israeli military government \u2014 i.e., another Gaza occupation that would be anathema to Palestinians and the rest of the world. They are even agitating to expel many, perhaps all, Palestinians from Gaza and to bring back Israeli settlements (which were evacuated in 2005). Israel will not carry out this monstrous ethnic-cleansing plan, which has no mainstream support, but an Israeli military government remains a distinct possibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant, who has tense relations with Netanyahu (the prime minister tried to fire him last year), has laid out his own day-after plan, one that is adamantly opposed by the right-wing ministers. Under the Gallant plan, the IDF would retain long-term military control of Gaza, but Israel would not administer the territory as it did until 2005. Gallant imagines local Palestinian administrators, not affiliated with Hamas, functioning under the oversight of the United States, European nations and moderate Arab regimes.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem: There is no chance that any other countries would take responsibility for Gaza without any Israeli commitment to Palestinian statehood. Yet Netanyahu has ruled out a two-state solution and even a Palestinian Authority role in Gaza. If Netanyahu went along with these demands from Israel\u2019s international partners, his right-wing allies would turn on him and he would lose power. That, in turn, would leave him in a weaker position to defend himself in his ongoing corruption trial \u2014 and in any future commission of inquiry about the failures that led to the Oct. 7 attack.\n\nTragically, Netanyahu\u2019s personal and political incentives are to allow military operations to continue indefinitely without making any hard decisions about what comes next. Thus, when the prime minister speaks of the \u201cday after\u201d in Gaza, he limits himself to vapid generalities \u2014 such as saying on Jan. 18 that \u201ctotal victory requires that Gaza be demilitarized, under Israel\u2019s full security control.\u201d Note that he does not even broach the all-important question of who will exercise political power in Gaza.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael is in dire danger of ignoring one of the most enduring lessons of counterinsurgency: Namely, victory requires not just tactical military success but a viable political end-state. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t matter how many insurgents you kill \u2014 more will simply spring up to replace them. That is a lesson the United States learned at high cost in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nDavid Petraeus, retired general and former U.S. commander in Iraq and Afghanistan, told me: \u201cWe experienced in 2003 following the fight to Baghdad and the toppling of the Saddam Hussein regime what the lack of adequate post-conflict planning can bring. Our vision and organization were inadequate, and the shortcomings were then compounded by seriously counterproductive decisions such as firing the Iraqi military. \u2026 In so doing, we created hundreds of thousands of Iraqis with an incentive to oppose the new Iraq rather than to support it and sowed the seeds of the insurgency that would plague us for at least four subsequent years.\u201d\n\nPetraeus hopes \u201cIsrael can determine and convey a vision that will enable them to avoid what we experienced.\u201d But it seems increasingly unlikely the Israeli government will ever come up with a viable postwar plan as long as Netanyahu remains in power and at the head of a far-right government.\n\nAdvertisement"}

For centuries Britain\u2019s royal family remained tight-lipped about health matters.\n\nWhen U.K. monarchs had real power, news of illness was withheld for fear it might weaken their authority. The habit of secrecy lingered after royals became constitutional figureheads.\n\nThe British public wasn\u2019t told that Charles\u2019 grandfather, King George VI, had lung cancer before his death in February 1952 at the age of 56.\n\nPat Price, founder of the Catch Up With Cancer campaign, said millions shared the \u201ccollective concern\u201d for the king\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cThe King\u2019s openness about his battle with cancer is a powerful reminder that one in two of us may face cancer at some point in our lives,\u201d Price said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sylvia Hui and Brian Melley in London, Danica Kirka in Helsinki and Darlene Superville in Las Vegas contributed."}

In Iowa, about 9 in 10 backed building a border wall, and three-quarters said immigrants do more to hurt than help the United States, according to AP VoteCast. And among those in New Hampshire who named immigration as their top priority, about three-quarters supported Trump.\n\n\n\n\u201cObviously Biden regards that as very problematic,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think you\u2019re seeing a renewed focus on this. That's why you're seeing him try to talk and act tougher about border security. But it's also why Trump really wants to focus on this as a core issue in the fall campaigns because it's one where he thinks he has a major advantage over Biden.\u201d\n\nThe deal reached Sunday would raise the threshold for migrants to receive asylum status, automatically shut down the southern border to migrants if crossings hit certain counts per day and provide billions in aid to Ukraine, Israel and for U.S. border security.\n\nThe core of the legislation will address how to slow the growing number of people who seek asylum from racial, religious or political persecution. But the system has become overwhelmed, resulting in years-long waits for cases to be heard. And once they\u2019re heard, an increasing number of migrants are failing to prove their asylum status \u2013 if they show up for their hearing at all.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Border Patrol\u2019s most recent figures, migrant encounters in December totaled 302,034, topping 300,000 for the first time and shattering the previous high of 269,735 in September.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have 10,000 people a day coming through the border just let loose wherever they want to go, bussed to wherever these governors send them, with no work permit, no family connection, no ability to settle somewhere,\u201d says Lanae Erickson, senior vice president for social policy, education and politics at Third Way, a center-left think tank in Washington, D.C. that aims to elevate common ground in controversial policy debates.\n\n\u201cWe have to fix that. I get that people are very jarred by Biden\u2019s change in language. And I am, too \u2013 in a good way. I wish he would have made this change a while ago. Democrats have to admit that this is a real problem.\u201d\n\nThe problems seem to be piling up quickly for cities across the country \u2013 and by proxy, for Biden.\n\nIn Denver, where nearly 40,000 migrants arrived over the past year, city officials have begun limiting the number of days migrants can stay in shelters and pushing them out onto the streets once they hit the cap. Last week in New York City, where approximately 66,900 migrants reside, a group of at least seven was arrested and accused of attacking two New York City Police Department officers outside a migrant shelter.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good for anyone,\u201d Erickson says. \u201cThat's why you're seeing Democrats be willing to do things they weren't doing in the past. Because if we\u2019re honest, this is unsustainable. It's not good for the migrants and it's not good for our country.\u201d\n\nThird Way is message-testing typical Democratic talking points on immigration and border security versus atypical messages that maintain Democratic values but talk about the issue in new and different ways.\n\n\u201cWhen you lined up the typical Democratic message against the attack, it tanked \u2013 no surprise,\u201d Erickson says. \u201cBut when you said we\u2019re the party that wants to restore order at the border and we believe we should fix our asylum system so that people can apply under U.S. law and get a decision that is fast, fair and final, we beat the Republican messaging by double digits.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it really is in the Democrats hands about whether they\u2019re going to continue to lose on this or reframe it. I think Biden has started thinking about how to reframe it.\u201d\n\nThe clock is ticking."}

But that should give time to digest the heavy amount of information since the start of the year and also to focus on the next steps from the Fed when it meets next month.\n\n\u201cThe ISM non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) survey will be the highlight of a light week for data releases,\u201d Comerica Bank wrote on Monday morning. \u201cThe survey is expected to show a pickup of activity among service-providing businesses and nonprofit institutions after the turn of the year; these firms account for roughly 70% of the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Best Cartoons on the Economy View All 182 Images\n\n\u201cConsumer credit (originated by both bank and non-bank lenders) is expected to have edged lower in December; more timely data on consumer loans issued by commercial banks show a monthly decline at year-end,\u201d they added. \u201cThe trade balance likely narrowed slightly in December, which contributed to the upside surprise from real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year.\u201d\n\nThe Fed kept interest rates unchanged at its meeting last week but in comments to reports, Chairman Jerome Powell threw cold water on the idea of a cut in March while leaving open the door to future reductions in interest rates.\n\nIn an interview with the CBS show \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday evening, Powell explained the rationale for waiting before cutting rates.\n\n\n\n\u201cGrowth is going on at a solid pace,\u201d he said. \u201cThe labor market is strong: 3.7% unemployment. And inflation is coming down. With the economy strong like that, we feel like we can approach the question of when to begin to reduce interest rates carefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, you know, we want to see more evidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%,\u201d Powell added. \u201cWe have some confidence in that. Our confidence is rising. We just want some more confidence before we take that very important step of beginning to cut interest rates.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s blockbuster jobs report from the government is likely to give Powell and his colleagues some pause as well as breathing room as it provided little evidence the economy or the labor market is in danger of an imminent recession.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trends we see in today\u2019s job report are likely to be taken by the Fed as a reason for caution \u2013 we may see an early spring but likely not an early interest rate cut,\u201d said Lightcast Senior Economist Rachel Sederberg on Friday.\n\nWhile the economy ended last year on a strong note, the expectation was that it would cool down as the calendar turned to 2024. Yet, early forecasts for economic growth in the first quarter and beyond have instead been raised.\n\nLast week, the International Monetary Fund boosted its projection for global growth to 3.1% from its October estimate of 2.9%, citing \u201cgreater-than-expected resilience\u201d in the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow forecast has the U.S economy growing at a 4.2% clip in the first quarter. At the same time, inflation has moderated to such a degree that consumer expectations about how much it will rise this year are now 2.9% \u2013 down from 3.1%.\n\n\n\nStill, prices remain a major concern for many, a recent survey by Santander Bank found. \u201cInflation remains the Top obstacle to achieving financial prosperity for middle-income Americans,\u201d Santander found, though it noted that \u201cthere are some early signs that concerns are easing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say everyone sees 2024 as without some economic headwinds."}

This type of insurance initially pays you the depreciated value of the damaged or destroyed property. After the replacement or repair of the object can be confirmed you provide the proof to the insurer and it will reimburse for the difference between the actual cash value and the value of the item without depreciation being taken into account. The gap between the depreciated value and what it costs to replace the item is the value of the recoverable depreciation.\n\nHow To Calculate Recoverable Depreciation\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s consider a television purchased new in 2021 for $2,000. Here is how we would go about determining the recoverable depreciation on this three-year-old TV, which loses about $400 a year in value because of wear and tear.\n\n\n\nCost when new : $2,000\n\n: $2,000 Depreciation : 20% a year, or $400\n\n: 20% a year, or $400 Current value: $800 ($2,000 minus three years of depreciation, or $1,200)\n\nHere is where you would stop if your policy only covers the ACV. You would receive a single check for $800, minus any deductible. If your deductible is $500, for example, you would receive a check for $300.\n\nIf you have an RCV clause on your policy, however, you would receive an initial check for $300, assuming the same deductible. However, once you went out and purchased a new television of like kind and quality at current prices, you could submit the receipt and be reimbursed for the depreciated amount of $1,200.\n\n\n\nThe first check for the television\u2019s depreciated value minus the deductible would be $300.\n\nThe second check, for recoverable depreciation, would be $1,200.\n\nThe total amount reimbursed over two checks would be $1,500.\n\nFind the Best Home Insurance in Your Area Get great homeowners insurance at an even better price. See Your Rates\n\nWho Needs Recoverable Depreciation?\n\nPurchasing a policy with recoverable depreciation allows for a greater level of reimbursement for your belongings, but the downside is that it is typically more expensive than a policy with actual cash value. However, it may save you money in the event of a claim. If your policy only offers you a payout of the actual cash value of your property, you may not have enough to purchase new items or make repairs at current market prices. If your policy includes recoverable depreciation, however, you will then be reimbursed for a higher amount after repairs or a replacement have been confirmed. This may make it a good choice for those who don\u2019t want out-of-pocket costs after a claim.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow to make a recoverable depreciation claim? You will want to check with your insurance agent about the exact procedure to follow when you need to file a claim. However, the process would generally follow these steps:\n\nFile your claim, either online, through an app, or with your insurance agent. An appraiser for your insurance carrier will appraise the damaged or destroyed property, ascertaining the actual cash value of each item. Once the claim is approved, you will receive a payment for the actual cash value of your property. You then either begin repair work or purchase new items to replace those which were lost. Show proof of repairs or purchases to your insurer. This may include store receipts or signed contracts for necessary work. You will receive a second check for the recoverable depreciation. Are there deadlines for filing a recoverable depreciation claim? Deadlines for filing a recoverable depreciation claim are determined by your insurer and by state law. In many regions, policyholders are required to submit claims within a year of the covered event. Submitting your claim promptly, however, is the best way to ensure that you will receive the financial assistance you need to repair or replace your belongings in a timely manner. Is recoverable depreciation the same as replacement cost? Not exactly. Replacement cost is what it costs to repair or replace your property in a covered claim without taking depreciation into account. Recoverable depreciation is the difference between the property\u2019s depreciated value, which takes wear and tear into account, and what it would cost to replace it at today\u2019s prices. What is non-recoverable depreciation? If you have an actual cash value (ACV) home insurance policy, you will not be compensated for the full amount it will cost you to replace damaged items. Instead, you will be reimbursed at a rate that takes depreciation into account. Non-recoverable depreciation is the term used to indicate the amount that you are ineligible to receive in this case, i.e., the difference between the ACV and the RCV.\n\nWhy You Can Trust Us"}

He just used it to make ends meet,\u201d Mullgrav said.\n\nTwo people close to the rap star, godson Karl Jordan Jr. and childhood friend Ronald Washington, are on trial in a case that has offered answers to the long-unsolved loss of a hip-hop legend while raising new questions about his life. Washington, 59, and Jordan, 40, have pleaded not guilty to murder.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nProsecutors have said the two men were going to be cut out of a lucrative transaction, which Mizell was arranging, to distribute 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of cocaine because a dealer \u2014 now identified as Mullgrav \u2014 wouldn't work with Washington.\n\nMullgrav told jurors that Mizell approached him in August 2002 to say he had a line on 10 or so kilograms of cocaine from the Midwest and \u201cwas asking me to move it for him\u201d in Baltimore. Mullgrav lived there at the time.\n\nMizell wanted to put Washington, who's known as \u201cTinard,\u201d on the ground in Baltimore, said Mullgrav, who grew up with both men.\n\n\u201cHe wanted me to work with Tinard. I told him no,\u201d Mullgrav said, because Washington \u201cwas a problem.\u201d Mullgrav said he disliked Washington enough to want to shoot him when he appeared in Baltimore around that time.\n\nMullgrav spent 12 years in prison on a federal drug conviction before his 2013 release, and he acknowledged in court that he sold cocaine, with 25 or so people working for him.\n\nHe testified only after being arrested on a material witness warrant \u2014 a procedure that can be used to compel uncooperative witnesses to come to court \u2014 and spending seven days behind bars, said Gary Farrell, an attorney who was appointed to represent him.\n\nMullgrav had been brought to the stand Friday but balked at giving evidence. He was laconic in court Monday and wore a large medical-style face mask.\n\nMizell's family has insisted he wasn't involved in drugs. Run-DMC, the first rap group to notch gold and platinum albums and have a video on MTV, helped the genre gain a wide audience in the 1980s.\n\nThe trio was outspoken about opposing drugs. Run-DMC did an anti-drug public service announcement and shows and declared on the platinum-selling 1987 single \u201cIt\u2019s Tricky\" that \u201cwe are not thugs, we don\u2019t use drugs.\"\n\nProsecutors \u2014 and some witnesses who were in the studio that night \u2014 say that Jordan shot Mizell while Washington brandished a gun and blocked the door.\n\nJordan\u2019s attorneys have said he was at his then-girlfriend\u2019s home at the time of the shooting. Washington\u2019s lawyers have argued that he had no reason to kill a friend who was helping him financially."}

When choosing a vacuum mop, be sure to confirm that it\u2019s well-suited to the type of flooring in your home.\n\nTypically, robot mops work best with tile, hardwood, and stone flooring. \u201cRobot mops work well for any kind of hard flooring, but if you have cracked tiles or missing grout, stick with manual mopping to avoid getting your subfloor wet,\u201d says Katie Berry, a residential cleaning expert and founder of HousewifeHowTos.com. \u201cAlso, if you have wood or cork floors, it\u2019s important to keep from using too much moisture when you clean them, so look for a model that specifically mentions being suitable for them.\u201d\n\nMany robot mops are able to detect which type of flooring they are cleaning and adjust their settings accordingly. This is particularly helpful in larger homes or homes with several rooms that have varied floor types.\n\nSmart Features: Robot mops are equipped with a wide assortment of smart features, ranging from smart home integration via voice assistants like Siri, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant, to self-cleaning capabilities, and sensors that detect different types of flooring. Many are accompanied by a smartphone app that allows you to control your mop and schedule cleanings remotely via Wi-Fi. Some robot mops use a combination of AI and 3D technology to map out your home, identifying different rooms and any obstacles it may encounter.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider how you intend to use your robot mop to determine which smart features are most beneficial. \u201cIf you plan to have it mop while you\u2019re gone or sleeping, look for a robot mop that can return to base to recharge, then resume the task. Or, if you\u2019re going to run it only when you\u2019re home, look for one that\u2019s quiet,\u201d says Berry. If you have a home with different types of flooring, especially one that alternates between carpet and hard flooring, look for a model that can elevate to cross thresholds.\n\nWater Tank Capacity: Different robot mops have different water tank capacities, and it\u2019s important to consider what size water tank is best suited to your home. Large homes with predominantly hard floors may benefit from a larger water tank than smaller spaces or homes that are mostly carpeted.\n\n\u201cJust as you want a cordless vacuum with a battery big enough to handle your home, you want a robot mop with a tank size that can clean an entire level in one go,\u201d recommends Berry. \u201cEvery model uses a different amount of cleaner, though, so make sure the one you\u2019re leaning toward suits your home.\u201d\n\nSome of the pricier and more advanced models are self-emptying, while more affordable, simpler models require you to manually empty and refill the water tank. If you have a larger home but you opt for a robot mop with a small water tank that is not self-emptying, you may need to empty and refill it multiple times throughout a single home cleaning. This may be a concern for some people, but not for others.\n\nWarranty: Like other types of small appliances and cleaning tools, robot mops are typically accompanied by a manufacturer\u2019s limited warranty. These warranties usually span one year, but some can be up to three years. Some retailers may also offer shoppers the option to purchase additional warranty coverage, which is often more comprehensive than the manufacturer\u2019s warranty and may cover instances of accidental damage. Before investing in a robot mop, be sure to carefully read the terms of its warranty. It\u2019s key to understand what is and what is not covered by the warranty and anything that could void the manufacturer\u2019s warranty, like accidental damage."}

Many policies provide at least coverage for $100,000.\n\nHow Much Dwelling Coverage Do I Need?\n\nStandard home insurance policies include coverage for your dwelling, personal property, liability (including guest medical expenses), and additional living expenses. Dwelling insurance covers damage to your home and any attached structures, such as a deck or garage. It may also include coverage for other structures on the property like a detached garage, shed, or fence.\n\nYour insurer may recommend the amount of dwelling coverage you need to be adequately protected. Two primary factors that play a role in determining the amount of dwelling insurance are the square footage of your home and local construction costs per square foot. Multiplying these two numbers can give you a rough estimate of what it would cost to rebuild your home following a disaster.\n\nThe cost of rebuilding is not the same as your home\u2019s market value or the price you paid for your home. For example, the cost of the land wouldn\u2019t be included in the cost to rebuild or repair your home. You can find out what local construction costs are by asking a realtor, your insurer, or a local builder.\n\nThere may be other factors involved, too. If you have an older home with infrastructure that is not up to current code standards, your costs may be higher to rebuild to comply with current municipal codes. Or if your home has custom features or uses higher-end materials you may pay more to rebuild or repair.\n\nExtended and guaranteed replacement cost\n\nSometimes, factors outside your control may increase the cost to rebuild or repair your home Consider one example: during the pandemic, supply chain issues meant that lumber and other building supply costs skyrocketed. Suddenly, it cost considerably more to repair or rebuild homes\u2014more than the coverage limits for some homeowners.\n\nOne way to ensure that this does not happen is by purchasing a policy that features either extended replacement cost or guaranteed replacement cost coverage. Extended cost pays a certain percentage over your limit \u2014 often 20% or 25% \u2014 thus helping if costs are higher than anticipated. Guaranteed replacement offers even more certainty: it pays whatever it costs to rebuild, no matter how much the amount exceeds policy limits.\n\nHow Much Coverage Do I Need for My Personal Belongings?\n\nYour home insurance also protects your personal belongings. It can be a challenge to tally up the cost of everything you own after a disaster. That\u2019s why compiling a home inventory can be an invaluable resource in the event your possessions are damaged or destroyed.\n\nA home inventory doesn\u2019t need to highlight every single one of your possessions, but it should note items of value and record the costs of big-ticket items like appliances or electronics. The Insurance Information Institute recommends taking pictures of all the rooms in your home or videotaping the rooms while you walk through your house. There are also mobile apps that guide you through creating a home inventory and can then be used to help determine the amount of coverage you need \u2014 or to submit to your insurer after a loss.\n\nMany insurers routinely offer personal property coverage starting at around 50 percent of your dwelling coverage, but it is possible to purchase higher or lower amounts. If you own particularly expensive items \u2014 jewelry, sports equipment, or artwork, for example \u2014 you may want to consider an endorsement for your policy called scheduled personal property coverage. This extra insurance expands coverage at a higher rate for these items.\n\nActual cash value\n\nMany insurers offer two possible ways to determine the value of your belongings. Actual cash value (ACV) coverage pays out the depreciated cost of your belongings. In other words, after a covered claim you would receive an amount equal to the estimated value of your items taking into account normal wear and tear.\n\nReplacement cost\n\nReplacement cost value (RCV) coverage, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t deduct for depreciation and pays out the amount you would need to purchase a new similar version of lost items. This type of coverage costs more, but also protects you from the significant out-of-pocket costs you may have with ACV coverage.\n\nHow Much Liability Coverage Do I Need?\n\nLiability insurance is the portion of your policy that applies if someone is hurt while on your property or by someone in your household, or they sustain damage to something they own. It can pay for both court costs as well as for any damages that are awarded up to coverage limits.\n\nLawsuits can be expensive, and juries have been known to award high amounts in court cases, so many homeowners policies feature a minimum of $100,000 in liability coverage. You can go higher, though. You should discuss with your insurance agent whether a higher amount would make sense for you.\n\nOne potential reason you might want to carry a higher level of liability coverage? If you have a dog that is a breed considered to be aggressive \u2014 think pit bull, Doberman pinscher, or Rottweiler \u2014 you may want to consider higher levels of liability. Some insurers may urge you to do so or may exclude coverage of the dog.\n\nThe liability portion of your homeowners policy will also include coverage for guest medical expenses. These will pay for medical bills, up to coverage limits, for guests that are injured on your property or by a member of your household such as a pet. Guest medical payments typically have much lower coverage limits compared to the other coverages in a homeowners insurance policy, generally between $1,000 and $5,000.\n\nIf you have a high net worth, you may want to purchase additional umbrella insurance to augment your liability. Umbrella insurance offers a safety net for you and your assets, providing coverage if you are faced with a claim that is higher than your liability coverage limits.\n\nFind the Best Home Insurance in Your Area Get great homeowners insurance at an even better price. See Your Rates\n\nHow Much Loss of Use Coverage Do I Need?\n\nThe fourth element of a homeowners insurance policy is called loss of use coverage, or additional living expenses (ALE) insurance. This coverage pays for the additional costs you incur if your home is unlivable following a covered claim. Most commonly, that would include hotel costs as well as the costs of meals, transportation, pet boarding, or any other fees or costs involved.\n\nLoss of use coverage comes standard with most policies, and your insurer is likely to set a limit to it that is a percentage of your dwelling coverage. That limit varies from insurer to insurer but is often between 20% and 30%. If your dwelling coverage is, say, $500,000 and you have a 30% limit for ALE, that would give you around $150,000 for the living expenses you incur until you can move back into your home.\n\nKeep in mind that this money is not meant to cover your regular living expenses. You still, for example, need to pay your mortgage costs. And if you normally spend a certain amount on food a month (say $300) but are now, while you are displaced, spending $500 on restaurant meals, your ALE coverage would pay for the $200 that is over your normal expenditure.\n\nOther Things to Consider\n\nNamed perils vs. open perils\n\nThere are two ways insurance companies write their policies: They cover you either for named perils or for open perils. A policy that covers you for named perils usually includes perils such as fire, hail, explosion, and theft. Open perils coverage, on the other hand, covers you for any events except those listed as excluded on your policy \u2014 thus providing broader coverage.\n\nIn many policies, dwelling coverage is written on an open peril basis, while personal property can be covered either via named perils or open perils. In both cases, however, it\u2019s important to note that standard policies generally exclude a few significant perils, including flooding and earthquakes. You will need supplementary coverage for these risks.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation increases the cost of both building materials and labor. This leads to increased costs of repairing, rebuilding, or replacing your home and personal belongings. The policy that covered you when you purchased your home may not be adequate to cover the costs of rebuilding in today\u2019s economy.\n\nOne solution is to review your policy annually, making adjustments as needed with input from a knowledgeable insurance agent. Another option, offered by some insurers, is an inflation guard endorsement. This add-on increases your coverage limits annually, based on a predefined percentage that the carrier uses to take inflation into account.\n\nOther policies and endorsements\n\nMost insurers offer a range of endorsements that allow you to customize your policy to suit your situation. Some common endorsements include sump pump and sewer backup, earthquake coverage, sinkhole coverage, and flood insurance. Flooding Is possibly the most common type of disaster that is not covered by home insurance. If you live in a flood zone, you may be required by your mortgage holder to purchase a flood insurance policy. These are most commonly available through the National Flood Insurance Program, although some insurers offer this type of insurance as well.\n\nWhy You Can Trust Us"}

The main business lobby group last month called for a pause all further statutory labour cost increases, saying the pace and scale of recent changes were leading to a rise in business failures.\n\nBusiness insolvencies in Ireland rose 32% year on year in 2023, but were still below pre-pandemic levels.

The visa restrictions could also apply to people who facilitate or get financial benefit from the misuse of commercial spyware, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe United States remains concerned with the growing misuse of commercial spyware around the world to facilitate repression, restrict the free flow of information, and enable human rights abuses,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement announcing the new policy. \u201cThe misuse of commercial spyware threatens privacy and freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association.

It did not accuse Jordan\u2019s government of the hacking.\n\nAmnesty International also reported that its forensic researchers had determined that Pegasus spyware was installed on the phone of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, just four days after he was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018.

U.S. News", "domain": "usnews.com", "pub_token": "CAAqJAgKIh5DQklTRUFnTWFnd0tDblZ6Ym1WM2N5NWpiMjBvQUFQAQ", "text": "Key Takeaways: Termite damage is rarely covered by a homeowners policy, so you\u2019d likely have to pay for repairs out-of-pocket. That can cost $10,000 or more for severe damage.\n\nThat said, if the damage caused by termites ends up causing a covered event, like a fire, you could get the fire damage covered. But any unrelated termite damage still wouldn\u2019t qualify.\n\nGetting regular inspections by professionals and taking steps to prevent infestations is vital for homeowners.\n\nWhen Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Termite Damage?\n\nThere can be specific circumstances when termite-related damage may be covered by your homeowners insurance. For instance, if it causes other damage that is covered by your homeowners policy, you may be able to get that paid for via your insurance, less your deductible.\n\nFor example, if termites have eaten their way through wires in the walls, and that causes a fire in your home. The fire damage may be covered by your policy, even though the original cause was the termites. However, you would still have to cover any leftover termite-only damage, if any remains.\n\nThis isn\u2019t always a given, and you\u2019d have to consult your homeowners policy to ensure that you\u2019re adequately covered. Talking to your agent is also a good idea here.\n\nWhen Doesn\u2019t Homeowners Insurance Cover Termite Damage?\n\nTermite damage is not typically covered by homeowners insurance, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). That\u2019s because infestations, like termites, are often considered by insurers to be preventable, whereas home insurance is meant to cover sudden, unexpected events. And, in general, you can\u2019t buy termite-only coverage from an insurance company.\n\nSo if your home simply has wood damage caused by termites, but it isn\u2019t impacting any system or contributing to a type of damage that is covered, you almost certainly will not be able to cover that cost with insurance. In that case, you\u2019d have to pay out of pocket for the full repairs. According to data from Angi, that can cost anywhere from just $250 up to $10,000 or more if the damage is severe.\n\nFind the Best Home Insurance in Your Area Get great homeowners insurance at an even better price. See Your Rates\n\nHow Can I Protect My Home From Termites?\n\nGetting your home inspected for termites is one key way to protect your home and make sure that it isn\u2019t at risk. If an infestation is discovered, the sooner you can get professionals in to take care of it, the better. For context, it can take anywhere from three to eight years for termite damage to actually show up.\n\nYou can also help prevent termites in the first place by regularly looking for and sealing up any potential points of entry, such as cracks in cement foundations. It\u2019s also a good idea to avoid piling or storing firewood next to your home and planting vegetation away from the structure of your home. You should also be sure to repair leaky faucets, roofs, and gutters to help prevent moisture accumulation.\n\nIf you live in an area where termite damage is especially prevalent, you may want to consider adding steel mesh or a physical barrier around the edges of your home to prevent infestations.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow do I file a home insurance claim for termite damage? Assuming the termite-related damage falls under that covered by your insurance, you\u2019d have to contact your insurance agent to inform them about the damage and start the claims-filing process. You should also be sure to document the covered damage, which may mean taking photos or videos of your home. Your insurance company would send an adjuster to assess the damage. Once approved, you\u2019d then be able to get your insurance company to cover the costs of repairing the damage, minus any deductible.\n\nWhat should I do if the termite damage isn\u2019t covered by insurance? If your termite damage isn\u2019t covered, as would be the case for most infestations, you\u2019ll have to cover those costs yourself. And it\u2019s important to get an exterminator as soon as possible to take care of it before it becomes worse. Be sure to check out the pest control companies in your area, reading reviews and getting estimates to find the best combination of good service and fair prices. Neighbors may have recommendations that can be especially helpful, since they may have dealt directly with those companies. Reputable exterminators will be willing to provide a copy of their pest control license, as well as the labels for all pesticides they\u2019ll use.\n\nWill home insurance cover additional living expenses? If the damage is bad enough that you cannot live in the structure, loss of use coverage (also called additional living expenses or Coverage D) would be able to cover the costs of living in another place while your home is being repaired. So if, for example, termites were to cause covered fire damages and you could no longer live in your home, your policy should provide funds that would help you cover the costs of living elsewhere for a time, up to your policy limit. This coverage is usually included in a standard policy. But, again, taking steps to prevent termites is always a good idea to avoid this type of damage.\n\nWhy You Can Trust Us"}

Bush, put it this way, writing in the Wall Street Journal: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with every policy decision the Biden administration has made. There are aspects of immigration strategy that are worthy of debate. But House Republicans are ducking difficult policy work and hard-fought compromise. Impeachment is a diversion from fixing our broken immigration laws and giving DHS the resources needed to secure the border.\u201d\n\nChertoff has been a serious public servant. Impeachment-hungry House Republicans are not, even though we really do have a border problem on our hands. The number of people crossing into this country is more than double what it was during the Trump administration. Most people encountered at the border are removed, returned or expelled, but millions await immigration hearings while in the U.S. The asylum system is broken. Avenues for legal immigration are unwieldy and overwhelmed.\n\nIn Texas, meanwhile, a latter-day George Wallace of sorts blocks the schoolhouse door. Despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing U.S. Border Patrol agents to remove a stretch of razor wire along the Rio Grande at Eagle Pass, Gov. Greg Abbott has refused to allow the federal government to do so. Twenty-five Republican governors are supporting Abbott (as does Roy, of course), while fringe militia groups, heartened by Abbott\u2019s obstinance, are headed to Eagle Pass spoiling for a fight.\n\nAbbott, a former attorney general, Texas Supreme Court justice and member of what was once the nation\u2019s self-proclaimed party of law-and-order, said in a statement last week that Biden has \u201cignored Texas\u2019s demand that he perform his constitutional duties\u201d and that Texas has declared an invasion, thereby invoking \u201cTexas\u2019 constitutional authority to defend and protect itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat authority is the supreme law of the land,\u201d he said, \u201cand supersedes any federal statutes to the contrary. The Texas National Guard, the Texas Department of Public Safety and other Texas personnel are acting on that authority, as well as state law, to secure the Texas border.\u201d\n\nFor Americans of a certain age, Abbott\u2019s defiance has a familiar ring. It brings to mind Alabama\u2019s \u201csegregation forever\u201d governor, George Wallace, who in 1963 barred African-American students Vivian Malone and James Hood from registering at the University of Alabama. In response to his schoolhouse-door defiance, President John F. Kennedy ignored the advice of every one of his aides (except brother Bobby) and issued an executive order federalizing the Alabama National Guard. Gen. Henry Graham of the Alabama National Guard told Wallace, \u201cSir, it is my sad duty to ask you to step aside under the orders of the president of the United States.\u201d Wallace stepped aside.\n\nSix years earlier, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus had ordered the National Guard to block nine Black students from enrolling in previously all-white Central High School in Little Rock, thus defying the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s monumental Brown decision three years earlier. A Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, responded by federalizing the entire Arkansas National Guard, Army and Air, and by sending riot-trained units from the 101st Airborne Division to escort the students into their new school. Both Eisenhower and Kennedy relied on the Insurrection Act of 1807 as justification.\n\nU.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, has urged Biden to take similar action. \u201cGov. Greg Abbott is using the Texas National Guard to obstruct and create chaos at the border,\u201d Castro posted on X. \u201cIf Abbott is defying yesterday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling, @POTUS needs to establish sole federal control of the Texas National Guard now.\u201d\n\nThe president could do just as the congressman suggests, but the blowback would be fierce.\n\n\u201cThat would be the biggest political blunder he could make,\u201d Abbott said on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show.\n\nLike Wallace, a four-time presidential candidate, the Texas governor craves national recognition and would relish having Biden inadvertently help him. In addition, University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck, writing in the New York Times, suggests that such a move \u201cwould be legally dubious on its own.\u201d\n\nIn Castro\u2019s X post, there\u2019s that word again: Chaos. Chaos in Washington that rivals anything at the border. How else to describe Republican border positions?\n\nCynicism also comes to mind. Thanks to a pairing of border-security legislation with military aid to a desperate European nation facing a \u201cborder crisis\u201d that is nothing short of existential, it\u2019s cynicism combined with heartless political calculation. Republican recalcitrance \u2014 and Trump\u2019s history of fanboy fawning over Vladimir Putin \u2014 means that the brave people of Ukraine are being left to Russia\u2019s ravaging wolves.\n\nWhat\u2019s frustrating about the chaos, cynicism and political calculation emanating from Washington is that Congress alone has the power to address the problem, if not fix it. But Congress refuses to do so. It has refused for decades.\n\nBefore western civilization gets destroyed, we might note that in Greek mythology, Chaos (or Khaos) is one of the primordial gods, ruling over a \u201cchasm\u201d or \u201cvoid impossible to measure.\u201d The word came to mean \u201cconfusion\u201d centuries later. Lucky us. On our southern border and in Congress, we have all three \u2014 a chasm, a void, and utter confusion.\n\nLaw professor Vladeck suggests at least one path toward clarification. Biden, he writes, \u201cwould be well advised to give a public address identifying facts and fiction about the administration\u2019s immigration policies, especially as they compare with those of his predecessors. The goal is not a publicity stunt but rather an honest effort to identify what the current challenges are, how they align with (and differ from) the challenges of the past and what he\u2019d like to do to meet them.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an even more fundamental path: According to Greek myth, it took a lightning bolt from Zeus to rein in Chaos. Since neither Biden nor Trump are lightning-bolt hurlers and since Republicans in Congress have no intention of solving our border confusion, it will likely take the American people to assume Zeusian powers. As election season arrives, we urge voters to reject nativist ideologues and Trumpian cultists in favor of sensible, conscientious public servants, whatever the party. Casting well-aimed bolts \u2014 er, ballots \u2014 We The People have the power to bring order out of the current border chaos.\n\n___\n\nSan Antonio Express-News. February 1, 2024.\n\nEditorial: Study shows moral failure of Texas\u2019 abortion ban, which makes no exceptions for rape\n\nExcept for rape or incest.\n\nWith those five words, the most restrictive abortion law in the nation could have been a little less cruel.\n\nFrom inception through implementation in September 2021, the Texas law that bans abortion starting at around six weeks of pregnancy and allows anyone to sue someone aiding and abetting an abortion was an unprecedented assault on women\u2019s reproductive rights. The law is so extreme it doesn\u2019t allow an exception for sexual assault.\n\nA study, published last month in JAMA Internal Medicine, estimates about 520,000 vaginal rapes of women ages 15 to 45 happened in 14 states with abortion bans that took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. When those bans took effect varies.\n\nThe study further estimates those rapes led to 64,565 pregnancies. Texas led this list with 26,313 rape-related pregnancies in 16 months.\n\nProjections were based on data from sources that included the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey and Bureau of Justice statistics. Historical data was used to estimate the number of vaginal rapes and how many of them led to pregnancy.\n\nQuestions about the study\u2019s methodology have been raised since the findings are extrapolations based on data that preceded the abortion bans.\n\nIf anything, these numbers are likely undercounts, given that rapes are historically underreported. The study is a jarring indicator of the prevalence of rape and demonstrates how the need for abortion exceptions is not merely a political talking point. This happens all the time, and victims of rape are being denied reproductive health options and body autonomy.\n\nIt also illustrates how the state compounds the trauma and horror that sexual assault victims experience. A girl or woman who has been raped has already been violated and denied the choice of what to do with her body.\n\nSome victims do choose to have the babies that result from rape, and they have loving relationships with their children. But it should be their choice. What if it\u2019s not the choice of the women for whom the pregnancy is a daily reminder of sexual assault? What of the 14-year-old child impregnated by her father? This is not a choice the state should have the power to dictate.\n\nA woman\u2019s decision to terminate a pregnancy, whatever the reason, is personal, emotional and painful. But it\u2019s exacerbated when the baby has been conceived in violence.\n\nIt\u2019s cruel and unconscionable for the state to prolong this torment. In 2021, when Texas\u2019 abortion law was being enacted, Gov. Greg Abbott was asked to justify not allowing exceptions for rape and incest. He said \u201cgoal No. 1 in the state of Texas is to eliminate rape so that no woman, no person, will be a victim of rape.\u201d\n\nIt was a cynical and insincere comment that disrespected rape victims.\n\nWe don\u2019t doubt that if given the power to eliminate rape, Abbott would use it. But he doesn\u2019t have that power to eliminate rape, and his comment ignored just how prevalent rape is in Texas and across the country. Because of Abbott and the Legislature, those women who are impregnated by rapists don\u2019t have the choice to exercise their reproductive rights unless they flee the state, but not all women have the resources to do that.\n\nTheir bodies and their choices should not be the concern of their legislators.\n\n___\n\nAIM Media Texas. February 1, 2024.\n\nEditorial: Moratorium on LNG development will do more harm than good\n\nPresident Joe Biden last week imposed a moratorium on the development of liquefied natural gas terminals in the U.S., citing their contribution to greenhouse gases.\n\nIt\u2019s an obvious effort to raise the support of young voters \u2014 and a poorly thought-out one at that.\n\n\u201cWe will heed the calls of young people and frontline communities,\u201d Biden said in a statement issued Jan. 26, saying they understand \u201cthe urgency of the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nFortunately, the order doesn\u2019t affect LNG export terminals that already have been approved, including two at the Port of Brownsville that are far enough along in development that they can continue. It does, however, immediately stop work on 12 other projects across the country, including Corpus Christi and Port Arthur.\n\nThis political move, however, likely will end up doing more harm to this country and its national interests, and worsen conditions in other countries. It promises to be a boon for Russia and its war against Ukraine, whose resistance our country already is spending billions of dollars to support.\n\nAdministration officials say they haven\u2019t determined if or how the moratorium will affect our national economy, or how much effect if will really have on greenhouse gas emissions. In this day of bloated, numbers-crunching bureaucracy, it\u2019s more likely that they have the information, but fear it might hurt Biden\u2019s reelection campaign rather than help it.\n\nLNG is a relatively new commodity but is rapidly replacing coal as the primary fuel for energy production. Natural gas already fuels nearly half of all power generated in Texas.\n\nU.S. companies began exporting LNG eight years ago, and already is the world\u2019s largest exporter. Russia is second. Global demand for U.S. LNG has been increasing rapidly, and even more since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Analysts noted quickly after the moratorium that if other countries can\u2019t rely on the U.S. for its fuel, it will see little recourse than to go to the next supplier \u2014 Russia \u2014 and that revenue will help in that country\u2019s war effort against Ukraine.\n\nCritics of Biden\u2019s order already have called it a \u201cwin for Russia.\u201d\n\nThe president is wrong to assume that he can force any country \u2014 including our own \u2014 to go green overnight with the simple stroke of a pen. He has even less control over foreign, autonomous countries, most of which aren\u2019t as affluent as ours and can\u2019t make such major changes in short measure. They\u2019ll continue to use the resources to have, and buy fuel wherever they can \u2014 including Russia.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that most of the LNG demand comes from countries that are friendly to the United States. A pipeline already runs from the Valley into Mexico to help feed that country\u2019s demand.\n\nOrdering a halt to new development of a commodity that is in high demand, and growing, curtails revenue that could be used in this country to fund major projects \u2014 including infrastructure improvements that Biden claims to support.\n\nOur public officials need to stop hurting our national economy, and our national interests, for their own political purposes \u2014 especially when, as in this case, such policies not only harm this country but provides support to a country that many consider to be our enemy.\n\n___\n\nLufkin Daily News. January 31, 2024.\n\nEditorial: Foul Fans: Full-grown adults should set a better example from the stands\n\nFor anyone wondering why there is a shortage of officials at any sport, they don\u2019t have to look far.\n\nIt was just two years ago that the Texas Association of Sports Officials put together a new policy that addressed \u201cthe drastically increasing rate of excessive verbal and physical abuse (any level) of our members officiating junior/middle and high school athletic contests.\u201d\n\nThe policy stated that steps could be taken if fans couldn\u2019t be kept in check. If three different reports were filed against a school, then a plan of action would have to be put in by school officials to address the situation.\n\nAnd in worst-case scenarios, the TASO had the ability to simply not send officials to games.\n\nAt the time, it seemed like one of those things that only happens somewhere else. Surely, our East Texas hospitality would at least make certain fans don\u2019t cross the line.\n\nUnfortunately, we were wrong.\n\nDuring a recent district basketball game, a fan was ejected by the officials for crossing the line. Fortunately, that fan respectfully left when learning of the ejection.\n\nWe would prefer they don\u2019t, but on occasion, things like that will happen. As long as the situation isn\u2019t further escalated, the game can go on.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the end of fans getting out of hand.\n\nAt the end of a heated altercation a few minutes later, fans were given specific instructions on what they needed to do to be able to watch the rest of the game.\n\nThe majority of the crowd listened. But a few didn\u2019t.\n\nTherefore it was announced that fans were going to have to leave the gym.\n\nWe aren\u2019t here to point fingers on who was at fault. Fans for both teams have done plenty of that already.\n\nWe are here to point out that it shouldn\u2019t be like this.\n\nWe love our high school sports, but at the same time, they\u2019re still just that.\n\nSports.\n\nThere are plenty of life-long memories for the athletes who invest so much into these sports.\n\nThey\u2019ll remember that buzzer-beating win or the fun road trip out of town. They\u2019ll remember the heartbreak of when their senior season ends.\n\nWhat they shouldn\u2019t remember is a game that ended because the adults in the arena forgot how they were supposed to act.\n\nCoaches are trying to teach life-long lessons through a sport. For some kids, it\u2019s the best way for them to learn about life.\n\nUnfortunately, when kids look up and see grown adults acting like 4-year-olds, they aren\u2019t seeing the greatest examples.\n\nWe\u2019ve said it before in this space, and we\u2019ll say it again. The refs at the game don\u2019t care who wins.\n\nThey\u2019re some of the few who will actually put themselves on the line to be yelled at in front of hundreds of adults on any given night.\n\nAnd most of the ones who complain the most are ones who would never actually switch positions with them.\n\nSo as the basketball season reaches the playoffs and baseball and softball players hit the fields, let\u2019s try to cheer on our athletes instead of degrading the officials.\n\nA little complaining isn\u2019t going to hurt anyone. When an entire gym is being asked to leave, it\u2019s probably a sign that at least one person crossed the line.\n\nSimply put, let\u2019s try to be better.\n\nAfter what we\u2019ve seen lately, it couldn\u2019t be much worse.\n\nEND"}

Currently, 97% of the panels deployed in Europe are imported, mainly from China.\n\n\"Given that we currently rely to a very important degree on imports to reach EU solar deployment targets, any potential measure needs to be weighed against the objectives we have set ourselves when it comes to the energy transition,\" she told lawmakers.\n\nThe Commission has set a target of 750 gigawatts of solar generation capacity by 2030, from 260 GW in 2023.\n\nEurope's solar panel manufacturing industry has urged the EU to step in with emergency measures to avoid local firms shutting down under price pressure from Chinese imports.\n\nIf these measures, including buying up excess inventories of EU solar modules, could not be done rapidly, it urged the Commission to consider \"safeguard\" measures that could include import tariffs and quotas.\n\nMcGuinness said she recognised that solar panel prices had fallen by more 40% due to global oversupply.\n\nShe said the EU had rules coming in designed to make public authorities consider factors other than price when holding tenders for clean-tech equipment. This would include a push to ensure that no more than 65% of supply is from a single source.\n\nUnder more flexible state aid rules, she said, the Commission had approved nine initiatives with a budget of more than 12 billion euros for clean-tech equipment, including solar panels.\n\nThe EU is also working with countries, including the United States and India, to reduce reliance on Chinese supply.\n\n(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Benoit Van Overstraeten and Paul Simao)"}

A vacant home endorsement or policy would help fill that coverage gap.\n\nBut, a vacant home insurance policy is not the same as a typical homeowners insurance policy. Some vacant homeowners insurance coverages may only cover the dwelling. This would provide you with basic coverage for things like theft, wind, fire, lightning, and leaky pipes. This is important for vacant homes as you may not be immediately aware when damage to the home occurs.\n\nThere are also options you can add to a vacant homeowners insurance policy such as liability and vandalism coverage, in case someone intentionally damages the property. You may also see the option for add-ons like separate structure coverage (such as a detached garage) or for personal property. You should consult your insurance agent or policy to figure out if vacant home coverage is necessary based on your circumstances.\n\nWhat Doesn\u2019t Vacant Home Insurance Cover?\n\nMany vacant home policies do not include liability coverage and may not extend to other structures, personal property, or vandalism, but they may be added as endorsements to the policy.\n\nLike standard homeowners insurance policies, vacant home coverage won\u2019t cover some natural disasters like floods or earthquakes. These will still require a separate policy or endorsement for coverage. Ask your insurance agent or review the terms of the policy to see where and when certain exclusions might apply.\n\nThese policies may also be short-term in nature, generally lasting between three months and a year, unlike home insurance, which provides year-round coverage. Once the term of the policy expires, so does your coverage, so any damages to a vacant home that occur after that date would have to be paid out of pocket. Plus, some insurers may only provide vacant home insurance for certain types of properties. So you may have to shop around to find an insurer that covers certain kinds of vacant homes.\n\nWho Needs Vacant Home Insurance?\n\nFor most homeowners, a vacant home policy isn\u2019t necessary most of the time. Your homeowners policy should spell out the length of time that constitutes a vacant home. But, in general, if you need to leave your home empty for at least 30 days, you may need a vacant home insurance policy to keep your home protected against potential damages. Many traditional homeowners policies will specifically exclude those damages due to the vacant status because it is riskier to insure than homes the homeowner lives in full-time.\n\nA few situations where you might need vacant home insurance include:\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve bought a new home but your old home is not yet sold\n\nRental properties that are currently without a tenant\n\nIf you\u2019ll be traveling for multiple weeks\n\nNew home constructions that are not yet inhabited\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure if you need a vacant home policy, or you\u2019re considering leaving your home vacant for a significant period of time, you should talk to your insurance agent about your options. They can tell you exactly when your current home policy coverage would apply, and any relevant exclusions based on your circumstances, and potentially provide a vacant home policy quote, if available.\n\n\n\nFind the Best Home Insurance in Your Area Get great homeowners insurance at an even better price. See Your Rates\n\nHow Much Does Vacant Home Insurance Cost?\n\nThe cost of a vacant home insurance policy will vary based on many factors such as where you live, type of construction, how long your home will be vacant, desired deductible, and how much coverage you want. But, generally, vacant home insurance does cost more than a traditional homeowners policy. That\u2019s because there is more risk associated with vacant homes. For example, while a homeowner may quickly notice something like a burst pipe in the home they occupy, it may take longer (and therefore lead to more damage) if the home is empty. Shopping around for policies is the best way to balance the premium, deductible, and coverages.\n\nHow To Keep A Vacant Home Safe\n\nIf you\u2019re leaving your house vacant for a period of time, there are several steps you can take to help prevent damage.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to go around the house and secure any windows, doors, and other entrances onto the property, such as fences, gates, and pet doors. This will help keep both people and pests out. You may want to consider options like deadbolts, motion-sensor lights, or a security system to bulk things up.\n\nSince you may not be around to do regular maintenance, it can also help do things like cleaning the gutters and performing any weather-specific tasks, like setting the thermostat or opening cupboards that house plumbing to ensure good airflow.\n\nIf possible, getting someone who will be close to the home to keep an eye on things is also helpful. That may mean talking to a neighbor or family member who lives in the area and getting them to do regular checks on the property to alert you to any obvious signs of damage before it becomes too costly. Having a car parked in the driveway can be a good visual deterrent to vandalism.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow do I purchase vacant home insurance? To purchase vacant home insurance you\u2019d have to contact an insurance company that offers that type of policy, either via their website or phone. Depending on the company, you may have to go through an agent to purchase a policy. You\u2019ll typically have to provide information about how long you expect the property to be vacant as part of the application process. How do I file a vacant home insurance claim? The first step is often to contact your insurer or your insurance agent to inform them about the claim, and they will help guide you through the process. Often, though, you\u2019ll have to provide documentation of the damages, such as photos or videos of any affected areas. Depending on the claim type, an adjuster may be sent to the home to evaluate the damage and ensure that it\u2019s covered by your policy. Once approved, you\u2019d be able to get any repair costs covered, after you\u2019ve paid the policy deductible. What is a vacant home? A vacant home is typically considered one that has been unoccupied for at least 30 to 60 days. The exact timing will depend on how your insurer defines it. Something to note here: Some insurers will provide \u201cvacant\u201d home insurance while others will refer to \u201cunoccupied\u201d coverage. The difference is that a vacant home is empty, while an unoccupied one will still have personal property inside, like furniture and other items. While some homeowners policies may not exclude \u201cunoccupied\u201d homes from coverage, they may exclude \u201cvacant\u201d ones. That\u2019s why you may need a separate vacant home policy.\n\nWhy You Can Trust Us"}

The ruling was part of a crackdown on LGBTQ+ people in the increasingly conservative country where \u201ctraditional family values\u201d have become a cornerstone of President Vladimir Putin's 24-year rule.\n\nRussian laws prohibit public displays of symbols of extremist organizations, and LGBTQ+ rights advocates have warned that those displaying rainbow-colored flags or other items might be targeted by the authorities.\n\nOn Monday, a court in Saratov, a city 730 kilometers (453 miles) southeast of Moscow, handed a 1,500-ruble (roughly $16) fine to artist and photographer Inna Mosina over several Instagram posts depicting rainbow flags, Russia's independent news site Mediazona reported. The case contained the full text of the Supreme Court ruling, which named a rainbow flag the \u201cinternational\u201d symbol of the LGBTQ+ \u201cmovement.\u201d\n\nMosina and her defense team maintained her innocence, according to the reports. Mosina said the posts were published before the ruling, at a time when rainbow flags were not regarded by authorities as extremist, and her lawyer argued that a police report about her alleged wrongdoing was filed before the ruling took force. The court ordered her to pay the fine nonetheless.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nLast week, a court in Nizhny Novgorod, some 400 kilometers (248 miles) east of Moscow, ordered Anastasia Yershova to serve five days in jail on the same charge for wearing rainbow-colored earrings in public, Mediazona reported. In Volgograd, 900 kilometers (559 miles) south of Moscow, a court fined a man 1,000 rubles (about $11) for allegedly posting a rainbow flag on social media, local court officials reported Thursday, identifying the man only as Artyom P.\n\nThe crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights in Putin's Russia has persisted for more than a decade.\n\nIn 2013, the Kremlin adopted the first legislation restricting LGBTQ+ rights, known as the \u201cgay propaganda\u201d law, banning any public endorsement of \u201cnontraditional sexual relations\u201d among minors. In 2020, constitutional reforms pushed through by Putin to extend his rule by two more terms included a provision to outlaw same-sex marriage.\n\nAfter sending troops into Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin ramped up a campaign against what it called the West\u2019s \u201cdegrading\u201d influence, in what rights advocates saw as an attempt to legitimize the war. That year, the authorities adopted a law banning propaganda of \u201cnontraditional sexual relations\u201d among adults, effectively outlawing any public endorsement of LGBTQ+ people.\n\nAnother law passed in 2023 prohibited gender transitioning procedures and gender-affirming care for transgender people. The legislation prohibited \u201cmedical interventions aimed at changing the sex of a person,\u201d as well as changing one\u2019s gender in official documents and public records.

Unlike standard homeowners or renters insurance, which typically won't cover seismic events, earthquake insurance steps in to fill that coverage gap. Primarily, earthquake insurance covers direct damage to your property resulting from the shaking of an earthquake. This can include structural damage to your home, such as cracks in the walls or foundation, and even complete collapse.\n\nAdditionally, earthquake insurance typically extends to personal belongings inside your home. If an earthquake causes your furniture, electronics, or other possessions to be damaged or destroyed, your policy can help cover the replacement costs.\n\nHere's a brief list of what earthquake insurance typically covers:\n\n\n\nStructural damage. The cost of repairing or replacing your damaged home. Personal property. Replacement costs for damaged belongings. Additional living expenses. If an earthquake renders your home uninhabitable, your policy may cover costs like hotel stays, meals, and other living expenses during repairs.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that there may be exclusions.\n\nDo I Need Earthquake Insurance?\n\nWhile earthquakes can occur in all 50 states, certain regions experience higher seismic activity and are more prone to earthquake risks. One such state is California, known for its frequent seismic activity due to the San Andreas Fault. States like Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada, and Washington also face significant earthquake threats. To better understand the earthquake risk in your area, check out FEMA\u2019s earthquake hazard maps. This resource will give you a visual representation of earthquake risks across the country.\n\nBut even if you don't live along a fault line, it may be worth considering earthquake insurance. Unexpected seismic events can occur anywhere, and the financial impact of repairing earthquake damage can be substantial.\n\nFor more specific information on the necessity of earthquake insurance in your state, visit your state's department of insurance website. It can provide localized data and resources to help you make an informed decision.\n\n\n\nFind the Best Home Insurance in Your Area Get great homeowners insurance at an even better price. See Your Rates\n\nHow Do I Get Earthquake Insurance?\n\nGetting earthquake insurance is a straightforward process. There are two main ways to purchase coverage: as an endorsement to your existing homeowner's policy or as a separate, standalone policy.\n\nEndorsement to homeowner's policy. Many insurance companies offer earthquake coverage as an endorsement to your existing homeowner's or renter's insurance policy. This means you can add it to your current policy.\n\nSeparate earthquake policy. If your current insurer doesn't offer earthquake coverage, or if you prefer a specialized policy, you can purchase standalone earthquake insurance from a different provider.\n\nFor California residents, the California Earthquake Authority (CEA) offers a valuable resource for securing coverage. CEA provides residential earthquake insurance policies and is publicly managed, largely privately funded, and not-for-profit. You can purchase a CEA policy through participating insurance companies.\n\nHow Can I Protect My Home From Earthquake Damage?\n\nWhile no one can prevent earthquakes, there are measures you can take to minimize potential damage to your home and property. Here are some effective strategies:\n\n1. Retrofit your house. Retrofitting involves structural modifications that help your home resist seismic forces. This includes bracing, bolting, and reinforcing your home's foundation and walls. Adding steel T-straps, metal roof ties, and anchor bolts can make your structure more earthquake-resistant.\n\n2. Secure heavy objects. Anchor heavy items such as mirrors, heavy furniture, cabinets, and appliances to the wall or floor. Consider relocating beds away from windows and avoid hanging heavy objects above seating areas.\n\n3. Install safety devices on appliances. Install automatic gas shut-off valves and secure water heaters and gas-powered appliances to prevent them from tipping over.\n\n4. Apply safety film to interior windows. Protective safety film, available at most home improvement stores, can minimize damage from flying glass during an earthquake.\n\n5. Store items wisely. Keep hazardous materials and heavy items on low shelves or in ground-level cabinets with latches.\n\nImplementing these measures can significantly reduce the risk of injury and property damage during an earthquake. While there's an upfront cost involved in making your home earthquake-ready, the investment can save you from substantial financial strain in the aftermath of a quake.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow do I file an earthquake insurance claim? Experiencing an earthquake can be unsettling, but having the right insurance coverage gives peace of mind. If your property sustains damage, here's how to file a claim:\n\nContact your insurer: Reach out to your insurance provider as soon as possible. Provide them with your policy number and details about the damage. Document damage: Begin by taking detailed photos and videos of all damage. This provides evidence to support your claim. Meet with the adjuster: An insurance adjuster will inspect your property to assess the damage. Be present during this inspection to ensure all damage is accounted for. Review the settlement offer: Once the insurer provides a settlement offer, review it thoroughly. If you disagree with the assessment, don't hesitate to negotiate. Remember, each insurance company has its own claims process, so familiarize yourself with your insurer\u2019s specific guidelines. What doesn\u2019t earthquake insurance cover? While earthquake insurance can provide crucial financial protection, it's essential to understand what it doesn't cover. Primarily, earthquake insurance only covers direct damage caused by the seismic event. This means secondary perils often associated with earthquakes, like floods or fire, are not typically included in coverage. In some cases, specific types of property damage, such as masonry veneer \u2014 the brick, rock, or stone that covers your home's exterior, may also be excluded. Your car or other vehicles will also not be covered by earthquake insurance. Moreover, other types of damage that an earthquake indirectly causes might require separate coverage. For instance, a landslide or mudflow triggered by an earthquake may not be covered. Understanding these limitations can help you plan for comprehensive protection. Does earthquake insurance cover additional living expenses? Yes, earthquake insurance may cover additional living expenses. If your home is uninhabitable due to earthquake damage or if civil authorities prevent you from residing in it, the policy may cover costs like lodging and meals. It's worth noting that most standard homeowners insurance policies will also include additional living expenses. But, check your policy for further clarification.\n\n\n\nWhy You Can Trust Us"}

(AP) \u2014 As San Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York tells the story, coach Kyle Shanahan took some convincing before deciding it was worth dealing a boatload of draft picks before last season's trade deadline for Christian McCaffrey.\n\nWith most teams around the NFL downgrading the value of running backs, the Niners ultimately decided the cost of four draft picks was worth it to acquire McCaffrey from Carolina if they wanted to have a team worthy of winning a championship.\n\nThat move was a big step in lifting the 49ers from a good offense to perhaps the most efficient in the NFL and is a major reason why San Francisco is preparing to play the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the time that you want to push your chips in the middle,\u201d York said. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s where we were with Christian. We did give up a lot. But I think we have one of the best, if not the best player in the National Football League on our team.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey has proven to be as valuable as anyone on the 49ers after leading the NFL in yards from scrimmage (2,023), tying for the lead in touchdowns (21) and generating the most first downs (114) in the regular season.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nThat earned McCaffrey a unanimous spot as the All-Pro running back and made him a finalist for both the MVP and Offensive Player of the Year awards that will he handed out this week.\n\nHe's added four more touchdowns and 260 yards from scrimmage in two playoff wins.\n\n\u201cHe's why our pass game and our play-action pass and all that kind of stuff opened up because he sort of sets the standard with the run game and then when we do pass the ball, he\u2019s there in our play,\" quarterback Brock Purdy said.\n\n\"He catches the ball, he makes guys miss, he can go up against safeties and linebackers and make them miss and stuff in the pass game. And then he scores touchdowns. His stats are crazy. So, he\u2019s definitely a valued player and I think the most valued player.\u201d\n\nThere are few backs as versatile as McCaffrey. He can run inside or outside. He excels at picking up blitzes as well as running pass patterns out of the backfield. Or he can line up in the slot or out wide and run pass patterns as well as many receivers.\n\nThat versatility can sometimes be a curse with some coaches viewing him more as a scat back than a traditional three-down back who can pound it between the tackles for positive yards play after play such as the old-school backs from the 1970s and \u201980s.\n\nThat\u2019s why McCaffrey made sure Shanahan knew as soon as he arrived that he could handle the heavy load of a three-down back who was physical enough to gain the tough yards when needed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably part of my insecurities and competitiveness.

Authorities will also use \u201csmoke cars\u201d in regions with the highest incidence of cases, diffusing an insecticide in the air.\n\nSince the beginning of 2024, the municipality has registered more than 10,000 dengue cases. That is just under half of the total cases \u2014 23,000 \u2014 recorded throughout all of 2023.\n\nThe announcement comes as tourists and revelers are pouring into Rio to take part in street parties and attend the samba schools\u2019 flamboyant parades.\n\nPhotos You Should See View All 45 Images\n\nDengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is more common in tropical climates. Frequent rains and high temperatures, which accelerate the hatching of mosquito eggs and the development of larvae, make the famously hot city of Rio susceptible to dengue outbreaks.\n\nBut the problem is national. The explosion of dengue cases across Brazil has caused at least four states \u2014 Acre, Minas Gerais and Goias, in addition to the Federal District \u2014 to declare public health emergencies.\n\nOn Monday, the Brazilian air force set up a 60-bed field hospital in the Federal District in Ceilandia that was due to begin treating patients.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to relieve emergency care units in the region, given that today the Federal District accounts for around 20% of dengue cases in the country,\u201d air force commander Lt. Brig. Marcelo Kanitz Damascene said in a statement.\n\nMost people who get dengue don\u2019t develop symptoms, but if they do these can include high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and a rash, according to the World Health Organization. While most get better after a week or so, some develop a severe form and require hospitalization. In such cases, dengue can be fatal.\n\nClimate change, which leads to increased temperatures and high rainfall, is associated with a higher risk of dengue, WHO said in December.\n\nRio Mayor Eduardo Paes urged \u201ccariocas\u201d \u2014 as the residents of Rio are known \u2014 to eliminate sources of still water, used by mosquitoes as breeding grounds.\n\n\u201cUnlike the COVID-19 pandemic, in which individual citizens couldn\u2019t do much more than demand that governments get the vaccine, in the case of dengue much depends on the action of each citizen,\u201d Paes said.\n\nIn March 2023, Brazil approved a vaccine against dengue and became the first country in the world to offer a dengue vaccine through the public health system, according to the health ministry. More than 3 million people were due to receive a jab in 2024."}

U.S. News", "domain": "usnews.com", "pub_token": "CAAqJAgKIh5DQklTRUFnTWFnd0tDblZ6Ym1WM2N5NWpiMjBvQUFQAQ", "text": "Key Takeaways: Homeowners insurance typically only covers plumbing issues that are sudden, accidental, and unexpected.\n\nPlumbing issues that are considered avoidable are usually not covered by home insurance. This includes causes like neglecting to do regular maintenance.\n\nThere are several steps you can take as a homeowner to avoid plumbing events, such as getting regular inspections from a plumber and making sure you aren\u2019t flushing non-flushable items.\n\nWhen Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Plumbing?\n\nHomeowners insurance is generally meant to cover sudden, unexpected, and unpredictable damage to your house and belongings, such as a burst pipe. Covered perils could also include water damage on the walls, floors, carpeting, furnishings, and electronic equipment, as well as potentially, the mold that results, too.\n\nThis type of plumbing-related damage would be covered under specific types of coverages, such as personal property and dwelling. Or, if the damage were to happen in a detached structure, like a separate garage, you may need to have \u201cother structures\u201d coverage in your policy to get that damage covered by insurance.\n\nIf the damage is severe enough, loss of use \u2014 which applies if and when your home is rendered unlivable \u2014 may also factor in. That would cover the additional expense of staying at a hotel and dining out while your home is repaired.\n\nAnother coverage that may apply in this type of situation is personal liability if, for example, the water damage also damages a neighbor\u2019s home. That way, you wouldn\u2019t have to pay for that damage out of pocket.\n\nWhen Doesn\u2019t Homeowners Insurance Cover Plumbing?\n\nIn general, if you have a plumbing issue that results from \u201cavoidable\u201d causes, your homeowners insurance would not cover that event. For example, if a homeowner failed to insulate their pipes (to prevent freezing in subzero temperatures) or to fix a leaky pipe before it bursts, the costly plumbing issues that may result from that neglect would not be covered. Likewise, if the damage were to result from normal wear and tear, that\u2019s also an excluded cause since, as the homeowner, you\u2019re expected to perform routine maintenance.\n\nFinally, a common exclusion here is sewer backups \u2014 though it will depend on how your policy is written. But in general, sewer backups and sump pump failures are not going to be automatically covered by a homeowners policy. That said, you may be given the option to purchase sewer backup coverage as an add-on to your coverages. But that typically means your premium will be higher. If you\u2019re unsure about your current coverages or want to discuss adding this type of coverage, it\u2019s best to talk to your insurance agent.\n\nFind the Best Home Insurance in Your Area Get great homeowners insurance at an even better price. See Your Rates\n\nHow Can I Prevent Plumbing Issues\n\nWhile some plumbing issues are unavoidable and happen without warning, others can be prevented with the proper due diligence. And it\u2019s important to stay on top of those avoidable issues to save money. For example, homeowners can \u2014 and should \u2014 regularly have their pipes inspected by a professional plumber. That\u2019s especially true for those who have older homes, whose infrastructure may be outdated or worn out.\n\nIf you live in a colder climate, insulating your pipes properly is essential to prevent them from freezing. This may also save you a bit of money on your energy costs during the winter by maintaining a higher water temperature more easily during those low temperatures.\n\nAnd then there are the best day-to-day use practices that can help you save on costly plumbing issues, including being mindful of what you flush. For instance, you should be aware that \u201cflushable\u201d wipes are often not actually safe for your pipes, according to many plumbers. So sticking to only flushing regular toilet paper and waste is the best practice.\n\nAnother option that homeowners may wish to invest in a water monitor, which can help you detect and stop pipe-related issues (like drops in water pressure, which could indicate a leak) early on.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow do I file a claim for plumbing damage? If you have plumbing damage that is covered by your homeowners insurance, you can file a claim by contacting your insurance agent and reporting the incident. (And you should do that ASAP.) They may require proof of damage, so you should thoroughly document that via photographs or video, and create a list of any objects that have been damaged. Your insurer should send someone out to your home to evaluate the extent of the damages. And, once approved, keep in mind that you will still have to pay your deductible, and then the insurance company would cover any costs over that amount.\n\nHow do I obtain sump pump or water backup coverage? If you want this type of coverage, you\u2019ll have to speak to your insurer about adding that to your policy. Your agent should be able to provide details about how that coverage works, any limitations that may apply, and how much it would cost to add that to your policy.\n\nHow do I obtain coverage for mold? In general, if the mold is caused by a covered event, such as an accident that causes water damage, that should already be covered by your insurance policy. There may be a time limit here, so report it quickly. Otherwise, however, mold would not be something for which you could obtain separate coverage. How do I obtain service line coverage? Service line coverage may be available from your insurer as an add-on to your homeowners policy. In that case, you\u2019d have to contact your agent to obtain that coverage. And you should note that this type of coverage may have its own deductible, separate from your homeowners policy.\n\n\n\nWhy You Can Trust Us"}

Copa, which is backed by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, is seeking a \u201cnegative declaration\u201d that Wright is not Nakamoto.\n\nElements of Wright\u2019s conduct were reminiscent of a \u201cfarce\u201d, said Hough, including the alleged use of ChatGPT to produce forgeries to back up his claims. Nevertheless, Hough said, Wright\u2019s insistence that he was Nakamoto \u2013 a claim he first made in 2016 \u2013 had \u201cdeadly serious\u201d consequences for individuals who had faced legal action based on his claims.\n\nHough said: \u201cOn the basis of his dishonest claim to be Satoshi, he has pursued claims he puts at hundreds of billions of dollars, including against numerous private individuals.\u201d\n\nIn written submissions, Hough added: \u201cDr Wright has consistently failed to supply genuine proof of his claim to be Satoshi: instead, he has repeatedly proffered documents which bear clear signs of having been doctored.\u201d\n\nA significant piece of evidence, the court heard, was that experts on both sides agreed that the original white paper was written on OpenOffice software. But the version provided by Wright was created on software called LaTeX, which did not exist when the white paper was written, Hough told the court.\n\nThe document that underpins the cryptocurrency is called Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System and was published in 2008 under Satoshi\u2019s name. Wright\u2019s claim he was Satoshi has been met with widespread scepticism in the cryptocurrency community because he has failed to produce the private keys \u2013 a secure code comprising a hexadecimal string of numbers and letters \u2013 that would unlock access to the 1.1m original bitcoins \u201cmined\u201d by Nakamoto. Those bitcoins are now worth about $47bn (\u00a337.5bn).\n\nWright\u2019s barrister, Lord Grabiner KC, said he had released the white paper after \u201chaving spent many years devoted to studying and working on concepts underpinning bitcoin\u201d. He added there was \u201cclear evidence\u201d demonstrating his creation of the digital currency.\n\nHe said on Monday that Wright possessed \u201can unusual combination of multidisciplinary talents\u201d and extensive experience in the field, and Nakamoto \u201cuniquely brought these together\u201d in the white paper.\n\nHe also said that Copa was \u201cexclusively concerned\u201d with undermining Wright\u2019s claim and that if anyone else was Nakamoto, they or their associates would have already come forward.\n\nIn written submissions, he added: \u201cThis issue has been the subject of extensive media comment since early 2016, as well as multiple sets of legal proceedings in this jurisdiction and elsewhere. If Dr Wright were not Satoshi, the real Satoshi would have been expected to come forward to counter the claim.\n\n\u201cDr Wright\u2019s use of the Satoshi pseudonym has its roots in his deep admiration for Japanese culture and a desire to maintain a certain level of privacy while developing and ultimately creating bitcoin,\u201d Grabiner added.\n\nThe trial before Mr Justice Mellor, in which Wright is scheduled to begin giving evidence on Tuesday, is expected to conclude next month with a decision in writing at a later date."}

It said: \u201cThis judgment establishes for the first time ever that anti-Zionist beliefs are protected in the workplace.\u201d\n\nThe Union of Jewish Students said Monday\u2019s judgment \u201cmay set a dangerous precedent about what can be lawfully said on campus about Jewish students and the societies at the centre of their social life. This will ultimately make Jewish students less safe.\u201d\n\nMiller initially caused controversy in 2019 when in a lecture he cited Zionism as one of five sources of Islamophobia, and showed a diagram linking Jewish charities to Zionist lobbying. Complaints that this resembled the antisemitic trope that Jews wield secretive influence on political affairs were dismissed by the university on academic freedom grounds.\n\nSince then, comments by Miller in online lectures describing Israel as \u201cthe enemy of world peace\u201d and a description of the Jewish Society as an \u201cIsrael lobby group\u201d that had \u201cmanufactured hysteria\u201d about his teaching further inflamed tensions.\n\nAcademics across the world signed rival letters. One described Miller\u2019s views on Zionism as a \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d conspiracy theory that jeopardised community relations on campus, while another warned that the investigation into him was fomenting a \u201cculture of self-censorship and fear\u201d, and urged the university to defend freedom of speech.\n\nMiller\u2019s case contended that he was subject to an organised campaign by groups and individuals opposed to his anti-Zionist views, which was aimed at securing his dismissal. The university subjected him to \u201cdiscriminatory and unfair misconduct proceedings which culminated eventually in his summary dismissal\u201d, he said.\n\nAt the time, the university said that although legal counsel had found that Miller\u2019s alleged comments \u201cdid not constitute unlawful speech\u201d, a disciplinary hearing had concluded that he \u201cdid not meet the standards of behaviour we expect from our staff\u201d.\n\nIn the 108-page judgment delivered on Monday, the Bristol employment tribunal ruled Miller had experienced discrimination based on his philosophical belief and had succeeded in his claim for wrongful dismissal.\n\nZillur Rahman, Miller\u2019s lawyer, said the case \u201cmarks a pivotal moment in the history of our country for those who believe in upholding the rights of Palestinians\u201d.\n\nThe ruling would be \u201cwelcomed by many who at present are facing persecution in their workplaces for speaking out against the crimes of the Israeli state, and the genocide taking place in Gaza\u201d.\n\nMiller would be seeking \u201cmaximum compensation\u201d, he said.\n\nThe tribunal ruled any award would be reduced by half \u201cbecause the claimant\u2019s dismissal was caused or contributed to by his own actions\u201d.\n\nMiller said he was \u201cvery proud that we have managed to establish that anti-Zionist views qualify as a protected belief under the UK Equality Act. This was the most important reason for taking the case and I hope it will become a touchstone precedent in all the future battles that we face with the racist and genocidal ideology of Zionism and the movement to which it is attached.\u201d\n\nThe University of Bristol said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d, adding: \u201cWe recognise that these matters have caused deep concern for many, and that members of our community hold very different views from one another. We would, therefore, encourage everyone to respond in a responsible and sensitive way in the current climate.\u201d\n\nThe tribunal hearing took place in October, just days after Hamas committed atrocities against Israelis living close to the Gaza border, and triggered a war that has devastated Gaza and left more than 27,000 people dead. The past four months have seen bitter divisions around the world on the issues.\n\nBut a longer backdrop to the Miller tribunal has played out on university campuses in particular, in the UK, US and elsewhere, centring on freedom of speech, the definition of antisemitism and whether anti-Zionism equates with being anti-Jewish."}

Sunak has said he can salvage the scheme.\n\nOpposition parties criticised his decision to agree to the bet with Morgan. The shadow paymaster general, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \u201cNot a lot of people facing rising mortgages, bills and food prices are casually dropping \u00a31,000 bets.

Hizb ut-Tahrir was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK government last month.\n\n\u201cThere he was, he was their lawyer when they were trying to resist this. We\u2019ve just proscribed them because we think that\u2019s what they are. These things speak to people\u2019s values.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Starmer\u2019s office dismissed the attack as \u201cdesperate nonsense\u201d.\n\n\u201cKeir Starmer oversaw the first ever prosecution of senior members of al-Qaida, the jailing of the airline liquid bomb plotters and the deportation of countless terrorists,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWith Keir\u2019s leadership, charge and conviction rates for sexual offences rose, victims were better supported, and the [Crown Prosecution Service] was reformed. The prime minister can only dream of having such a record of serving his country.\u201d\n\nSunak and other Tories have repeatedly attacked Starmer for having worked with Hizb ut-Tahrir in 2008, shortly before he became the director of public prosecutions. Starmer was part of a team of lawyers who submitted an application in June 2008 to the European court of human rights to challenge a ban on its activities in Germany. The appeal was rejected.\n\nA Labour official said Starmer had not represented the organisation in court but was part of a three-chamber team that submitted an initial application to Strasbourg, and that the nature of legal work involved representing and advising people no matter their views.\n\nSunak raised the link at prime minister\u2019s questions in January. The government proscribed the group for promoting terrorism and praising the 7 October attacks on Israel."}

Piers is the most important person in any room he enters; if you understand that you will get along with him just fine. His ego is in inverse proportion to his self worth. There is Piers World or there is nothing. That level of narcissism must get tiring after a while \u2013 the constant struggle to reconfigure reality, the terror of it all falling apart.\n\nNot that Rishi Sunak looked particularly grateful to be granted an audience on TalkTV. Rather he seemed edgy and on guard. As if he would rather have been anywhere else but had been nudged into a game of high stakes macho bullshit politics. He had to prove he was man enough to last an hour with the UK Sun God. He said he would do it a year ago and he\u2019s a man who does what he says. Except when he doesn\u2019t, of course.\n\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d asked Morgan, welcoming Sunak into an ante-room in No 10. Piers looked fine. He always does. A mixture of too much Botox, perhaps, and a conscience that doesn\u2019t trouble him nearly as much as it ought to. Rishi, put it mildly, looked shit. The last year has not been kind to him. He\u2019s aged a lot and appears far older than his early 40s. If ever a man could do with a prolonged California detox, it\u2019s Sunak.\n\nPiers quickly reminded Rishi who was boss. They had last met on a flight to LA at Christmas. In first class, natch. But Piers had taken the front row seats. Again, natch. No one can out-Piers Piers. Not that he would like everyone to know that. But sometimes he just can\u2019t help himself.\n\nAnyway, time to try to put the interviewee at ease. By telling Sunak that he understands how difficult it can be to be prime minister. Hell, he, Piers, has basically been prime minister for the last 25 years. He knows Downing Street far better than Rishi. But not to worry. He\u2019s one of the good guys. So he\u2019ll make allowances for him. Maybe they could just do a bit of mutual arse-kissing? Piers quite likes that. He knows it\u2019s wrong but deep down he needs to be loved.\n\nOn to some awkward blokey bants that made Sunak look more and more uncomfortable, out of his depth. Which, to be fair, was to his credit. You wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to be at home on Planet Morgan. Who knew Gareth Southgate the best? Who knew Tony Blair the best? Who had watched more England cricket? No contest. But thanks for taking part.\n\nWho had more charisma? Rishi or Keir Starmer? Sunak tried to change the subject. \u201cStarmer doesn\u2019t have a plan,\u201d he said. Piers didn\u2019t pick him up on this. Didn\u2019t say that the Labour leader has been going on and on about his plan for the last year. Because deep down the interview was all about Piers. This was his show, his ratings. His questions were always going to be much more interesting than Rishi\u2019s answers. They were just linking segments.\n\nTalking of which: according to the YouTube statistics, there were about 5,000 people watching the early showing of the real prime minister interviewing the prime minister. Who was to know which was which? Neither had been elected. And of those who had tuned in, not everyone seemed to be following the conversation. Someone called Aaa typed: \u201cRishi is good looking enough to have secret affairs with British wives.\u201d Thanks for that insight, Aaa.\n\nThen on to the safety of people in the public eye. Another subject close to Morgan\u2019s heart. \u201cKeir Starmer is a terrorist sympathiser,\u201d said Sunak during a segment on Israel and Gaza. Really? Piers just nodded that through. Didn\u2019t make any attempt to challenge it.Then again, he also didn\u2019t make much of the US losing interest in Ukraine. Probably best not to remind people no one had fawned over Donald Trump more than him in the early years of his presidency. That reality had been rewritten. We were in an alternative Piersphere.\n\nFor the last half hour, Rishi moved on to his five pledges, and Morgan was there to mark the homework. A grateful nation awaited. Inflation, that was a pass. Though Sunak had done nothing to make it happen. Debt, that was a half mark. Er \u2026 it\u2019s actually gone up. But apparently it\u2019s in Piers\u2019s gift to award marks for bullshit. He\u2019s an expert in that.\n\nMorgan was equally indulgent about growth. Another half mark for the possibility we may be out of recession by 0.1% by next month. Apparently that\u2019s what Sunak had always meant. That and hopefully growing the economy some time in the next year, though not so much that anyone would notice. This wasn\u2019t turning into the most rigorous or demanding interview. All that mattered was that it was longer than anyone else\u2019s.\n\nSunak had to concede that the health service was a big fail. His team may not thank him for that, though it\u2019s hard to argue otherwise. Piers also knew it was a fail because his mother had to wait on a trolley after having a heart attack. Only things of which Morgan has had direct experience can actually be said to have happened. Everything else is just a fantasy.\n\nFinally to the small boats. Morgan was inclined to give Rishi a tick. Even though he had said he would stop the boats, not stop a few of them. Language can mean whatever you want. But Piers did have a big problem, he said. He thought the Rwanda plan was rubbish. And when Piers has a problem, he offers a bet.\n\nThis could have been Morgan getting all Billy Big Bollocks about football with Gary Lineker on X after a couple of bottles of Ch\u00e2teau Margaux. Only it was with the prime minister over the lives of refugees. And Sunak was mad enough to accept. Because to both of them, \u00a31,000 means nothing. Just loose change. And Rishi wanted to look tough with Piers. It was a low moment in TV interviewing. It was an even lower moment for British politics. Two men who literally gave a toss about nothing except their egos. A bonfire of the vanities.\n\nLuckily, that was it. Sunak looked relieved when Morgan let him go. It had been a long hour. Then any hour with Piers invariably is. Someone called Julian wrote on the YouTube chat board: \u201cFree Drugs.\u201d I knew how he felt."}

They also pump more dirt into people\u2019s lungs and planet-heating gas into the atmosphere.\n\nBut cities seeking to cut the numbers of SUVs on their streets face resistance from owners and apathy from others. The result of the vote in Paris, which passed by a narrow margin and with a low turnout of just 5% of the city, was that 55% threw their support behind the plan.\n\nTurnout was even lower than a previous referendum to ban electric scooters, said Brian Caulfield, a transport professor at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cParisians over the past decade have seen much bigger changes in transport than this new SUV measure and this could be linked to the low turnout.\u201d\n\nOutside a polling station in the wealthy ninth district of Paris, where 40% of cars are SUVs, even supporters of the proposal said they felt uncomfortable with the symbolism of the vote.\n\nMarie-Claire Polo, a 30-year-old journalist, said the rise of SUVs was an \u201cecological absurdity\u201d but added that parking charges were too high for some people who needed a car.\n\nJoanne Boulenger, a 33-year-old marketer, said she wanted to send a signal to make Paris greener but also worried that the referendum turned people against each other. Her boyfriend, she added, saw the referendum as \u201cdemagoguery\u201d and had not gone to vote.\n\nSandra Weigand, 70, said she had chosen not to vote because she found it polarising. \u201cTo be a bit more green, to be a bit more environmentally responsible, I say yes. But to stop people from living, from parking \u2026 it\u2019s not possible.\u201d\n\nTransport experts say that, to clean up the sector, policymakers need a mix of \u201ccarrots\u201d like cheap public transport and \u201csticks\u201d like taxes on bigger cars. But the latter has proven a hard sell.\n\nNew cars in the EU and UK have grown 1cm wider every two years, the Guardian revealed last month, and sales of large luxury cars have increased. The International Energy Agency has warned that the global rise of SUVs is hurting efforts to cut emissions but politicians have made little effort to reduce their popularity.\n\nOne challenge is that attempts have been met with fierce resistance from the automobile lobby and in countries from the UK to Germany the issue has been dragged into a culture war.\n\nIn Germany, efforts to put a general speed limit on motorways have been criticised by its most pwerful tabloid and senior ministers as an infringement on civil liberties. In the UK, some people have spread the idea that \u201c15-minute cities\u201d are government efforts to control the population.\n\nBernard, 82, coming out of the voting station, said the Parisian proposal amounted to \u201cdiscrimination\u201d. He added that it was a myth that big cars were more dangerous than small ones, despite research showing the opposite.\n\nA retired lawyer who gave his name as Monsieur Durand said he voted against the proposal because he already paid enough in tax for his SUV. \u201cIf there are some who can afford beautiful cars, others see it as a good reason to be jealous.\u201d\n\nParis is on track to become the first capital to charge heavy cars more than lighter ones, though a similar scheme has been announced in Lyon, the third-largest city in France. The association of German cities has also come out in favour of such a scheme.\n\nAnne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, has said she hopes to inspire other cities. The vote could also send a signal to carmakers to stop making bigger cars.\n\nArthur, a 27-year-old working in logistics, said he wanted the vote to reverse the trend in size. \u201cIn the city centre you see more and more SUVs and fewer and fewer small cars. I hope this can push us to move back to smaller cars.\u201d"}

Plans to set sail from Portsmouth on Sunday were abandoned and sister vessel HMS Prince of Wales is being readied hastily to take its place.\n\nDidn\u2019t another embarrassing breakdown happen recently?\n\nThe HMS Prince of Wales broke down in August 2022, one day after setting sail for the US, due to a broken propeller shaft, which was misaligned when installed. The vessel had also been flooded twice in its first year of service, after being commissioned in 2019.\n\nAfter the Prince of Wales incident, the propellers on the Queen Elizabeth were also checked and no misalignment discovered. The defects were \u201cnot a class issue,\u201d the Ministry of Defence confidently said in April, although the latest failure will raise questions as to how effective the checks on the Queen Elizabeth were.\n\nThe Royal Navy insists that this time the issue with the propeller, designed by Rolls-Royce, is different. The problem on the Queen Elizabeth relates to the coupling on the starboard propeller shaft, an issue most likely caused by \u201cwear and tear\u201d, and it was deemed prudent not to sail and risk a failure at sea. It is not yet clear how extensive the repairs will have to be, and whether the Queen Elizabeth will have to return to Rosyth dockyard on Scotland\u2019s Firth of Forth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to have maintenance issues with state-of-the-art ships which contain complex engineering and technology,\u201d the navy said.\n\nHow much of a problem is it this time?\n\nWarships periodically suffer from mechanical issues, although the UK\u2019s two new aircraft carriers \u2013 built for \u00a36.4bn \u2013 seem to be particularly unfortunate. France\u2019s only carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, broke down in 2009 and 2010 but has not been reported as having problems recently. The USS Gerald R Ford, one of 11 in the US navy, suffered from a propulsion problem in 2018 forcing it to abandon sea trials.\n\nBecause the UK has a second aircraft carrier available, the Prince of Wales will be able to deploy in the next fortnight, navy sources indicated. That will allow it to take the place of its sister vessel in Exercise Steadfast Defender, Nato\u2019s largest military exercise for decades, which takes place off the Norwegian coast. The Prince of Wales will form the heart of a carrier strike group, defending Scandinavian countries from a simulated Russian attack.\n\nDoes it matter if the Prince of Wales can deploy instead?\n\nStrictly no. All navies need alternate warships and militaries have to show they can be adaptable. There is no maritime threat to the UK, and despite talk of Britain sending an aircraft carrier to the southern Red Sea, no need for it to do so given the US is deploying the USS Dwight D Eisenhower. The US navy secretary, Carlos Del Toro, said in London last month that the UK was providing the most useful warship it could: HMS Diamond, a destroyer that specialises in eliminating aerial threats.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nick Childs, a naval analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat embarrassing and not ideal to say the least, given the flagship nature of these ships and the fact that much had made of HMS Queen Elizabeth taking a prominent role in this major upcoming Nato exercise Steadfast Defender.\u201d Allies may wonder how reliable the Royal Navy would be in the event of a significant crisis involving Russia \u2013 the British contribution to Nato\u2019s maritime strength is supposed to be 20%-25%.\n\nIs this a systemic problem of an under-resourced military?\n\nA report by the Commons defence committee on Sunday highlighted that the UK\u2019s armed forces were \u201cconsistently overstretched\u201d while personnel numbers were falling. Navy recruitment targets have been missed every year since 2010 and overall service numbers are 5% below the target set in 2015. Naval engineers are one of the professions emphasised as having \u201chad huge demands made of them\u201d.\n\nYet, for all the complaints about overstretch, defence spending has been rising in real terms since 2017-18, with the navy the most modern of the three services. Questions about the breakdown of Britain\u2019s two aircraft carriers in relatively short order may better focused on their design, in case both are needed at once."}

Whatever you do, don\u2019t ask a doctor", "domain": "theguardian.com", "pub_token": "CAAqBggKMJeqezDfswk", "text": "I recently asked two wise doctors, senior in their profession, what was wrong with today\u2019s NHS. Was it money? Was it recruitment, or pay, or structure? Without consulting each other, they answered what was wrong in one voice: \u201cUs.\u201d\n\nTales of NHS woe flow almost daily. Britain is now ranked 30th out of the 49 richest OECD countries for infant mortality, with matters getting worse, according to the Academy of Medical Sciences. Meanwhile, surgical waiting times can stretch to five and a half years in Northern Ireland, according to the Royal College of Surgeons. The Times health commission this week found an NHS in digital chaos, with \u201cbetween 40 and 60\u201d types of patient records and 10% of hospitals still entirely paper-based. It wants a nationalised care system, a sugar tax and \u201chealth passports\u201d.\n\nThose who have spent time banging their heads against NHS reform will find little new here. Margaret Thatcher and John Major tried to upheave the NHS on multiple occasions, including through devolution and the \u201cmarketisation\u201d of GPs and hospitals. All failed. They simply increased the bureaucracy, egged on by management consultants. Costs soared under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Nothing seemed to improve. This week, Rishi Sunak admitted he had failed totally to shorten waiting lists.\n\nMost prominent public services are facing an efficiency crisis. The worst afflicted \u2013 medicine, the courts, the universities, the armed forces \u2013 are built around deeply conservative professions. But consultants, barristers, professors, colonels never blame themselves. While Britain\u2019s trade unions have seen decades of reform, the professional unions have resisted all change. They are adept at escaping both blame and reform. When two medics debated the NHS on Monday\u2019s Today programme, they comfortingly agreed that its failings lay elsewhere, in obesity and child poverty.\n\nOf all the industries nationalised by Labour after 1945, the NHS is the most riddled with restrictive practices, guarded by an iron shield of public affection. Last month\u2019s launch of Pharmacy First, allowing chemists to offer simple drug treatments and thus save 10m GPs referrals a year, took 20 years to achieve. As for the rule that you have to be referred by a GP to see a hospital doctor before a cancer scan, it must surely be the cause of Britain\u2019s poor cancer record.\n\nMedical training is still medieval. The collapse of British dentistry results from the profession requiring five years of mostly irrelevant study followed by two of \u201csupervision\u201d. Recent hospital militancy has its roots in the longstanding exploiting of \u201cjunior\u201d doctors by consultants, and in the subordinate status accorded to senior nurses, largely because most are women.\n\nThe Heath government\u2019s 1974 centralisation of local clinics and health centres wiped out the last shred of local government healthcare. It put GPs and A&E doctors in absolute charge. It meant that for children and elderly people, curing illness \u2013 not sustaining wellness \u2013 became the NHS\u2019s sole concern. Care of elderly people vanished below stairs.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow health minister, Wes Streeting, is likely soon to take on this burden. As have many before him, he has breathed the language of reform. He should look for lessons abroad and from the UK\u2019s now booming private sector. But the first question he should ask is: why have all his reformist predecessors fallen at the first fence?\n\nThe answer is he must go where none has dared. He must confront and restructure the medical profession. Otherwise nothing will change, nothing at all."}

There is, however, a third way: being famed for a single role, in one of the best-loved TV shows ever. This can bring a peculiar blend of attainment and limitation, which many performers would happily settle for.\n\nIan Lavender, who has died aged 77, took this route with grace and patience as Private Frank Pike, the timid teenage rookie of the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard in Dad\u2019s Army. Lavender appeared in all 80 episodes from 1968 to 1977, and features in the single most shared moment, when a captured German U-boat officer responds to some schoolboy rudery by ordering the boy soldier to give his name, causing Arthur Lowe\u2019s Captain Mainwaring to bark: \u201cDon\u2019t tell him, Pike!\u201d\n\nSo revered is the series that episodes up to 46 years old are still showing on BBC Two and the rerun network Gold. The sitcom continues to be the only classic TV show that has no need to run an episode as a tribute when a lead actor dies \u2013 it will be in the schedules anyway \u2013 although, poignantly, Lavender is the last of the main actors to be lost.\n\nHe was in regular demand on screen and stage and had a later recurring role in EastEnders as Derek Harkinson, an amateur theatre star and old friend of matriarch Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) who, as one of the soap\u2019s earliest gay characters, featured in a storyline about homophobia.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ian Lavender on EastEnders. Photograph: Jack Barnes/BBC/PA\n\nBut it was Pike who dominated his career, as the actor accepted by giving his benediction to a 2016 movie remake of Dad\u2019s Army. Lavender even appeared as a Brigadier while Blake Harrison flattered him with imitation as the platoon junior.\n\nPike was a prime example of the meticulous characterisation and visual sense of Dad\u2019s Army writers Jimmy Perry and David Croft. The Home Guard historically contained men too old to be called up for the main army, so the authors needed a plausible reason for young Pike not to be at the front. They found it in asthma and sinus conditions that led him to fail a military medical \u2013 a backstory inspiring the huge home-knit scarf that his worried mother insisted he wore on parade and became one of two signature TV scarves (the other being Tom Baker\u2019s in Doctor Who).\n\nPike is 19 in the opening episode, and Lavender was two years older. After graduating from Bristol Old Vic theatre school, he played \u201cjuvenile leads\u201d at the Marlowe theatre in Canterbury, where a TV casting director chose him for another youthful part in a half-hour ITV play, Flowers At My Feet, in 1968.\n\nCroft saw that and liked the actor for Pike. The fact that Croft\u2019s wife, Ann Callender, was Lavender\u2019s agent led both Pike and the BBC to have brief qualms about the casting, but Callender pointed out that the character could always be written out if the actor flopped.\n\nIn fact, he made an immediate impact. Though Lavender was the least known member of the ensemble, he shared the first dialogue in the opening episode with Lowe and maintained high levels of screen-time. It helped that, though Pike was frail and puny, Lavender was at least half or a third of the age of his cast-mates, several of whom were in fragile health. Perry and Croft sensibly chose Lavender for drenching, drowning, driving, falling and sporting scenes, maximising his participation.\n\nView image in fullscreen From left Clive Dunn, James Beck, John LeMesurier, Arthur Lowe, John Laurie, Ian Lavender and Arnold Ridley in Dad\u2019s Army. Photograph: Douglas Miller/Getty Images\n\nPike\u2019s extreme naivety next to the worldly suavity of John Le Mesurier\u2019s Sgt Wilson also made for a strong double-act, with the young man not realising that \u201cUncle Arthur\u201d is his widowed mother\u2019s secret lover.\n\nThe sweet innocence Lavender brought to the part allowed Croft and Perry to smuggle in some of the innuendo they enjoyed in another of their shows, Hi-De-Hi! In The Making of Private Pike, the young squaddie borrows a car to take a woman on a date. When it breaks down, he spends all night trying to get the vehicle home but is winkingly assumed in town to have had a night of passion. \u201cI was pushing and she was steering!\u201d he pleads to Wilson. Lavender and Le Mesurier play the exchange at such perfect cross purposes that Dad\u2019s Army\u2019s status as a family show is never threatened. Lavender told Graham McCann, Dad\u2019s Army\u2019s historian, that it was his favourite scene.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to What's On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It\u2019s rare for actors to be famous for a catchphrase they didn\u2019t say, but the character\u2019s name is the punchline, and the panic about Nazi execution in the event of Allied defeat that races across Lavender\u2019s face is a lesson in how to double a line\u2019s impact with a reaction shot.\n\nIn 1976, when the US broadcaster ABC made a pilot for a version of Dad\u2019s Army called The Rear Guard, the episode adapted was The Deadly Attachment. However, because the troop junior was renamed, the punchline became \u201cDon\u2019t tell him, Henderson!\u201d The series was not commissioned and serious scholars of comedy \u2013 including the writer-performer Barry Cryer \u2013 used this to argue that short, hard syllables are inherently funnier. The writers\u2019 view was that, while \u201cPike\u201d could be blurted out by Mainwaring without thinking, even a buffoonish figure would realise their mistake and stop short during the three syllables of Henderson.\n\nWhatever the reason, it made the name Pike famous and ensured warm thoughts towards Ian Lavender for as long as Dad\u2019s Army remains loved which, at the moment, seems likely to be for ever."}

None of those included in the study had a history of suicide attempts.\n\nAfter taking into account factors including psychiatric disorders, other health conditions and demographics, the team found those with PCOS had an 8.47-fold higher risk for suicide attempts than women without PCOS but who otherwise had similar characteristics.\n\nWhen the team broke down the findings by age, they found the risk of suicide attempts was 5.38 times higher for adolescents, 9.15 times higher for adults under 40, and 3.75 times higher for older adults, compared with controls.\n\nThe authors of the study suggest concerns over the impact of PCOS, including potential infertility and worries over body image, could be among the factors at play.\n\n\u201cBody image concerns, including perceived obesity and acne, have been associated with suicide risk during adolescence, and these problems are common among adolescents with PCOS,\u201d they write, adding that young adults may experience additional challenges such as unemployment, financial difficulties and relationship problems.\n\nThe drop in increased risk in older adults, the team suggest, could be linked to an improvement in the symptoms of PCOS with age.\n\nWhile the research has limitations, including that it cannot prove cause and effect and could not take into account all possible factors that may muddy the waters, it is not the first to suggest an association between PCOS and suicide.\n\nDr Sophie Williams of the University of Derby, who was not involved in the new research, said a number of studies had revealed similar findings in recent years, while her own work had raised concerns around self-harm and suicidal ideation among women with PCOS.\n\n\u201cWe know that women with PCOS are more likely to have depression and anxiety \u2013 that\u2019s been shown time and time again in a number of research papers,\u201d she added.\n\nWhile Williams said there were a number of possible explanations \u2013 including possible differences in parts of the brain that may be associated with PCOS \u2013 she stressed there were only a handful of studies looking into possible pathways.\n\n\u201c[PCOS] is a very, very underresearched area in general, and mental health within that is even more underresearched,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, Williams said women with PCOS who were experiencing difficulties needed to know they could reach out for help \u2013 including through the NHS.\n\n\u201cIt is a very hard first step to take, but it is potentially a life-changing step,\u201d she said."}

Pike, their junior in most cases by several decades, had been excused because of his weak chest, and always wore the scarf insisted upon by his widowed mum, Mavis.\n\nIn spite of their foibles and foolishness, Mainwaring\u2019s pomposity and the frequent slapstick sequences, the heroes of Dad\u2019s Army were courageous men prepared to give their lives to protect their country, and it was this innate nobility that lifted the series, written by David Croft and Jimmy Perry, to greatness. At its peak it had more than 18 million weekly viewers, and is still regularly rerun.\n\nThere were many catchphrases \u2013 Lance Corporal Jones\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t panic!\u201d, Private Frazer\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019re doomed!\u201d and Sergeant Wilson\u2019s languid \u201cDo you think that\u2019s wise, sir?\u201d \u2013 and the best-remembered belongs to the gangster movie-fixated Pike, though he did not utter it himself: Mainwaring\u2019s weary \u201cYou stupid boy!\u201d\n\nPike was also involved in Dad\u2019s Army\u2019s most frequently quoted joke. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d snarls the German U-boat commander who has been captured by the platoon. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him, Pike,\u201d shouts Mainwaring. There was often great subtlety in the inter-platoon relationships, best exemplified by that of Pike and Wilson (John Le Mesurier). Wilson, whom Pike calls Uncle Arthur, is Mrs Pike\u2019s lodger, and is forever fussing around the boy, making sure his scarf is on tight and gently steering him away from danger. It was not until the end of the final series that Lavender asked Croft if \u201cUncle Arthur\u201d was actually Pike\u2019s father. \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Croft.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ian Lavender in 2014. Photograph: Si Barber\n\nBorn in Birmingham, Ian was the son of Edward, a policeman, and Kathleen (nee Johnson), a housewife; his mother often took him to see pantomimes, variety shows and Saturday morning cinema, which gave him his first ambitions to become an actor. After performing in many school drama productions at Bournville boys\u2019 technical school he was accepted, with the help of a grant from the city of Birmingham, by the Bristol Old Vic acting school. Clearly far from being a stupid boy, he passed 12 O-levels and four A-levels. \u201cThe only reason I don\u2019t have a degree is because I went to drama school,\u201d he said years later.\n\nHe made his first television appearance soon after he graduated from Bristol in 1968, playing an aspiring writer whose family want him to get a proper job, in Ted Allan\u2019s play for the Half Hour Story series, Flowers at My Feet, with Angela Baddeley and Jane Hylton.\n\nIn the same year, he was cast as Pike, joining the seasoned veterans of comedy and the classics Le Mesurier, Arthur Lowe (Mainwaring), Clive Dunn (Jones), John Laurie (Frazer), James Beck (Private Walker), Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey) and Bill Pertwee as Air Raid Warden Hodges. Janet Davies played Mrs Pike.\n\nWhile Dad\u2019s Army catapulted Lavender to national fame at the age of 22, the role of Pike haunted him for the rest of his long career. Not that he had any complaints.\n\nAsked in 2014 if he got fed up with a lifetime of having \u201cstupid boy\u201d called out to him in the street, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of Dad\u2019s Army. If you asked me \u2018Would you like to be in a sitcom that was watched by 18 million people, was on screen for 10 years, and will create lots of work for you and provide not just for you but for your children for the next 40-odd years?\u2019 \u2013 which is what happened \u2013 I\u2019d be a fool to say \u2018Bugger off.\u2019 I\u2019d be a fool to have regrets.\u201d\n\nAfter Dad\u2019s Army, Lavender made further television appearances, including Mr Big (1977), with Peter Jones and Prunella Scales, and in 1983 he revived Pike for the BBC radio sitcom It Sticks Out Half a Mile, a sequel to Dad\u2019s Army, but it was not a success and lasted only one series. In contrast, the original series, with most of the regular cast, had been rerecorded for radio from 1974 to 1976 and proved very popular.\n\nHe was also in the BBC TV series Come Back Mrs Noah (1977-78), co-written by Croft; and played Ron in a new version of The Glums (1979) for London Weekend Television, adapted from Frank Muir and Denis Norden\u2019s original radio scripts of the 1950s. There were more smallish television parts in the 80s, such as two episodes of Yes, Minister, and bits in Keeping Up Appearances, Goodnight Sweetheart, Rising Damp and Casualty. He starred in the unsuccessful BBC series The Hello Goodbye Man in 1984 and provided the lead voice in the children\u2019s cartoon series PC Pinkerton in 1988.\n\nHe was also in various quiz shows, including Cluedo (1990). On Celebrity Mastermind, broadcast on BBC1 on New Year\u2019s Day 2009, when the presenter John Humphrys asked him to state his name, a fellow contestant, Rick Wakeman, shouted: \u201cDon\u2019t tell him, Pike!\u201d\n\nIn addition to co-starring in the first film version of Dad\u2019s Army (1971), he appeared in various low-level British sex farces of the 1970s, including Confessions of a Pop Performer (1975), Carry on Behind (1975), Adventures of a Taxi Driver (1976) and Adventures of a Private Eye (1976). He also starred in the thriller 31 North 62 East (2009). \u201cI was close to getting two very big movies in the 70s,\u201d he said without rancour in 2014, \u201cbut in the end they said: \u2018We can\u2019t get past Private Pike.\u2019\u201d\n\nLavender\u2019s second best-known role was his delicate and sympathetic portrayal of Derek Harkinson, Pauline Fowler\u2019s gay friend, in the BBC soap EastEnders from 2001 to 2005, and again in 2016-17.\n\nIn addition to various live Dad\u2019s Army productions, his stage work included the Peter Hall Company\u2019s The Merchant of Venice, with Dustin Hoffman as Shylock in 1989, touring as the Narrator in The Rocky Horror Show in 2005, Monsignor Howard in the London Palladium production of the musical Sister Act in 2009, The Shawshank Redemption at the Edinburgh fringe in 2013, and his own one-man show of reminiscences, Don\u2019t Tell Him, Pike.\n\nLavender had a great admiration for Buster Keaton, and was an expert on the silent comedian\u2019s career. In 2011 he introduced Keaton\u2019s Sherlock Jr (1924) at the Slapstick silent comedy festival in Bristol, and commented that finding Keaton\u2019s grave in the Fountain Lawns cemetery in Hollywood had been one of his life\u2019s special moments.\n\nIn 2016 a new cinema version of Dad\u2019s Army was released, with Toby Jones as Mainwaring and Bill Nighy as Wilson. Private Pike was played by Blake Harrison, and Lavender was promoted to play Brigadier Pritchard. In a touching in-joke, his younger face was also seen on an advertisement poster in a street scene.\n\nLavender is survived by his second wife, Miki Hardy, whom he married in 1993; by his sons, Sam and Daniel, from his first marriage, to the actor Suzanne Kerchiss, which ended in divorce; and by two granddaughters.\n\nArthur Ian Lavender, actor, born 16 February 1946; died 2 February 2024"}

Huffman, who is married to the Fargo actor William H Macy, pleaded guilty of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud after paying $15,000 (\u00a312,000) for an improved SAT score to help their eldest daughter win a place at college. Huffman recently said that she would have felt like a bad mother had she not done it.\n\nI am not in any way whitewashing what I did, but some people have been kind and compassionate \u2013 others have not\n\nPerched on the edge of the stage today, the 61-year-old former star of Desperate Housewives has a laptop open beside her. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018What exactly do I want to say to possible questions?\u2019\u201d she says by way of explanation, though she glances at the screen only fleetingly. When I ask how she feels now about the college admissions scandal \u2013 for which she served 11 days in prison, paid a $30,000 fine and completed 250 hours community service \u2013 she uses the code name given to the case by the FBI. \u201cYou mean Varsity Blues?\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018How I am is kind of a loaded question. As long as my kids are well and my husband is well, I feel like I\u2019m well.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a curiously disembodied answer, and for a moment Huffman seems not entirely present as she scans the rows of empty seats in front of her. The auditorium is cold, which explains why she hasn\u2019t removed her black scarf and dark grey wool coat, but the layers of clothing only heighten her barricaded air. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to be here,\u201d she says decisively, locking eyes with me at last. \u201cBut how am I? I guess I\u2019m still processing.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018I guess I\u2019m still processing\u2019 \u2026 Huffman with her husband William H Macy leaving court in 2019. Photograph: Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nShe has barely worked since the scandal broke. \u201cI did a pilot for ABC recently that didn\u2019t get picked up. It\u2019s been hard. Sort of like your old life died and you died with it. I\u2019m lucky enough to have a family and love and means, so I had a place to land.\u201d\n\nThose means lie at the heart of the controversy. It seemed outrageous that a figure of such obvious privilege (Huffman was born into a wealthy banking family) should throw even more weight on the scales. As might be expected, she has encountered a range of reactions from the public. \u201cI\u2019m not in any way whitewashing what I did but some people have been kind and compassionate. Others have not.\u201d\n\nAmong her defenders is her good friend David Mamet, who wrote an open letter insisting that Huffman should have received the \u201cTexas Verdict\u201d which means: Not guilty, but don\u2019t do it again. \u201cI thought it was kind and brave of him to say something, regardless of what it was.\u201d What does she think of his Texas Verdict argument? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says flatly, bringing the matter to a close.\n\nView image in fullscreen Riding high \u2026 Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria and Huffman in Desperate Housewives. Photograph: Ron Tom/Disney General Entertainment Content/Getty Images\n\nMac, who uses the pronoun \u201cjudy\u201d, tells me later over video-call from New York that the nature of Huffman\u2019s crime is part of what makes her perfect for the role of Paige. \u201cHer personal troubles are all about how afraid she was and how much she loved her child,\u201d judy says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what Paige is going through.\u201d\n\nHir shows an average 21st-century American family in freefall. Isaac returns from military service in Afghanistan to find the homestead in disarray. Detritus is piled high; his sibling Maxine has transitioned into Max, and now uses the pronouns \u201cze\u201d and \u201chir\u201d. Meanwhile his mother, Paige, has subdued her former abuser, Isaac\u2019s father, Arnold, who has had a stroke; she dresses him as a clown, pumps him full of oestrogen and pledges her allegiance to the LGBTTSQQIAA community. Or, as she pronounces it, \u201cLuggabuttsqueeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaige has the enthusiasm of a new convert,\u201d says Huffman fondly. \u201cShe\u2019s a zealot, but in a good way. She has been contained for so long and now she is free. If she thinks something, it comes straight out of her mouth.\u201d Though she has never behaved like that herself (\u201cI\u2019m too measured\u201d), Huffman knows how it feels to be sidelined. \u201cIt\u2019s better now that I\u2019m older but the message my whole life was: \u2018Take up less space.\u2019\u201d The \u201cKaren\u201d phenomenon is one example. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of shutting us up. I\u2019m not saying that white women, like anyone, shouldn\u2019t be called out on their bullshit. But it seems like a bit of a gag order, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Wouldn\u2019t be able to do it now\u2019 \u2026 Huffman was Oscar-nominated for her role as a trans character in Transamerica, 2005. Photograph: Contentfilm/Allstar\n\nShe is keen to stress that Hir isn\u2019t an \u201cissues\u201d play. \u201cIf it was just \u2018transgender people are people too\u2019, you\u2019d go, \u2018OK. Very true. And where\u2019s the story in that?\u2019\u201d Gender dominates the characters\u2019 conversations but it isn\u2019t the play\u2019s subject. \u201cIt\u2019s about care,\u201d Mac says. \u201cHow do you care for home when home is abusive? And should you? These questions are central to our lives. They are certainly central in Britain with Brexit and the way you switch prime ministers every two seconds.\u201d\n\nMac began writing it in the 1990s (when \u201chir\u201d was one of the pronouns used by some members of the trans community) but it wasn\u2019t produced until 2014 because of a casting stipulation. \u201cPeople kept telling me to cast a woman as Max instead of a trans male or non-binary actor,\u201d says Mac. \u201cThey claimed there weren\u2019t any other options. Now there have been more than 70 productions, and each one has had a different trans man or non-binary actor as Max.\u201d\n\nBack in 2006, Huffman was Oscar-nominated for playing a trans woman in the drama Transamerica, a role she admits she \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to do now\u201d. Then, the conversation about authentic casting had not yet permeated the mainstream. What is her stance today? \u201cI think we should reflect the audience and that\u2019s got to include everybody. There has been such inequity for so long and now the pendulum must swing the other way. But I hope it leads to a situation where anyone can play anything.\u201d\n\nI ask what it was like to meet the trans actor Alexandra Billings, who had been offered the lead in Transamerica only to have it rescinded once Huffman expressed an interest. \u201cThere was no trans actor originally,\u201d she replies. I read her a quote from Billings, who bumped into Huffman at a function in 2017 and asked her: \u201cDid you know that you stole the role in Transamerica from me?\u201d The actor looks bewildered. \u201cI have no memory of that.\u201d Then she makes a menopause joke: \u201cAs an excuse, I also have no oestrogen left in my body.\u201d We move on.\n\nReturning to Hir, I wonder whether the chaotic house in the play symbolises the US. \u201cI guess you could say America is in the moment right before the play begins,\u201d she says. \u201cThe country is so siloed. My husband and I are Democrats and we thought we should try watching different news channels that don\u2019t tell us what we want to hear.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018I hope we get to a situation where anyone can play anything\u2019 \u2026 Huffman with non-binary actor Thal\u00eda Dudek in rehearsals for Hir. Photograph: Pamela Raith\n\nOr they could speak to Mamet, a proud Donald Trump supporter. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to do with someone you love,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t understand it.\u201d Isn\u2019t it worth trying, now that a second Trump presidency is a possibility? \u201cAnything I can do on the ground with my actions and my pocketbook to help that not happen, I am committed to doing. But talking a loving friend out of their political convictions? I\u2019m not signing up for that.\u201d Was she surprised when Mamet swung to the right in his 2008 essay Why I am no longer a \u201cbrain-dead liberal\u201d? \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t really wanna go into it,\u201d she says, squirming in her coat. We move on again.\n\nBack to Paige. Could choosing such a flamboyant, fearless character at this point in Huffman\u2019s life represent a statement of intent after her downfall? After all, she could have made her comeback with something polite and low-key. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she smiles. \u201cMaybe it is a statement. I suppose I could have done The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.\u201d Instead, she will be rampaging around for two hours and generally letting rip like a woman with nothing to lose. One stage direction, for instance, reads: \u201cPaige takes a bendy-straw from the kitchen and attempts to figure out how she would blow crystal [meth] up her butt with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMax and Paige are feeling a lot of things that were pent-up for many years and now they are letting them all out,\u201d says Mac. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re not making the most rational choices. But who can blame them?\u201d"}

I think that it\u2019s realistic to understand that the fact that no one has seen him recently and he\u2019s not been spotted by anybody would mean that he has either come to harm and is lying somewhere and yet to be found, or someone\u2019s looking after him, as he\u2019s not been outside for some time. I think they are the obvious two hypotheses.\u201d\n\nDet Supt Rick Sewart, leading the manhunt, said it could take some time to find the suspect if he is hiding: \u201cIf we are in a situation whereby he is being held in one specific address it clearly could take several weeks, if he\u2019s being fed and watered by somebody and wants to lay low.\u201d\n\nSewart said he was keeping an open mind on whether the attack was planned solely by Ezedi or not, and that there is no sign he was planning to go on the run or into hiding, saying: \u201cIt is our belief that someone in the community will know more about the whereabouts of Ezedi.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old woman left seriously injured is still too ill to speak to police, has been sedated since the attack, and left with \u201cvery significant facial injuries\u201d.\n\nThere is concern for the sight in her right eye and Savell said he cannot confirm whether the woman and suspect were in a relationship.\n\nOne hundred specialist officers are part of the manhunt, which is staffed like a major murder hunt or counter-terrorism operation. Sewart said: \u201cIt\u2019s always more difficult to crack a manhunt where they don\u2019t have their mobile phone on them.\u201d\n\nPolice have worked through 200 calls of possible sightings, and asked anyone who thinks they have seen Ezedi \u2013 left with significant facial injuries after the attack \u2013 or knows something to call them, with a \u00a320,000 reward on offer.\n\nPolice said that early on Monday detectives arrested a man aged 22 for assisting an offender. He was released later the same afternoon on bail within hours of being detained, with inquiries continuing.\n\nPolice said officers from the counter-terrorism fugitive team are helping sift through hundreds of hours of CCTV.\n\nThe main focus is on London and Newcastle, where Ezedi lived. A search of his flat uncovered bottles of corrosive alkaline chemicals believed to be liquid sodium hydroxide or liquid sodium carbonate.\n\nSewart said police were talking to neighbours and associates of Ezedi and he could be hiding in the north-east or the capital.\n\nEzedi\u2019s \u201ckey\u201d link to London was that he was visiting the victim, police said."}

They studied what happened to these viruses when the mice they inhabited were exposed to chronic social stresses, such as being housed alone or in overcrowded conditions, and found that stress exposure led to changes in the composition of the viruses and the bacteria in the animals\u2019 guts.\n\nNext, they harvested viruses from the droppings of unstressed healthy animals, and transplanted some of them back in, once the mice had been exposed to chronic social stress. The research, published in Nature Microbiology, suggested these transplants reduced levels of stress hormones and curbed depression- and anxiety-like behaviour in the mice.\n\nWhile further studies are needed to assess whether virus transplants are beneficial to humans suffering from stress-related conditions, the research provides some of the first evidence that gut viruses are involved in the response to stress, and that manipulating them could have therapeutic benefits.\n\n\u201cGiven that the virome composition varies greatly among individuals, it may open the door for personalised medicine approaches for stress-related disorders in the future,\u201d said Prof John Cryan at APC Microbiome Ireland, who led the research. \u201cOne thing for certain, we must acknowledge that not all viruses are bad and they can play a key role in keeping the bad bacteria in our gut at bay especially in times of stress.\u201d"}

The statement referred to a famous marble plaque in the Old Bailey celebrating the independence of jurors in the \u201cBushel\u2019s case\u201d of 1670, where a jury refused a judge\u2019s direction to find defendants guilty.\n\nWarner was protesting over restrictions in climate activist cases, imposed by Judge Reid, which prevented defendants from mentioning climate change, insulation or fuel poverty in front of a jury.\n\nThe prosecutions have inspired a succession of escalating protests across the UK under the banner Defend Our Juries. In December, more than 500 people sat outside courts all over the country holding similar signs while administrative staff, lawyers, judges, jury members and the public queued to get through security.\n\nProtesters were also present outside the trial of Extinction Rebellion co-founder Gail Bradbrook, who was given a 15-month suspended sentence in December for criminal damage.\n\nSeveral sign-holding protesters, including Laura Kaarina Korte and Indigo Rumbelow, have been arrested and interviewed but no other charges have been levied. Most of those involved have not faced any consequences for their actions.\n\nThe 300 signatories of the latest letter describe the decision to prosecute Warner as an attack on free speech and democracy. \u201cIn response to such violations of constitutional principle \u2026 a broad alliance from civil society has emerged, consisting of members of the public, lawyers, academics and other professionals,\u201d they say.\n\nDr Clive Dolphin, speaking on behalf of Defend Our Juries, said jurors are some of the few people in the criminal justice system who can apply their conscience, but they can only do that if they have all the facts.\n\nHe added that the issue went far beyond climate change. \u201cThere are all sorts of places where it\u2019s important to understand someone\u2019s motivation. So once you pervert the criminal justice system to allow you to crack down on protesters for the environment \u2026 that affects a whole swathe of criminal justice procedures.\u201d\n\nCivil liberty campaigners have said Warner\u2019s prosecution is part of a growing government crackdown on the right to protest, and last month the UN special rapporteur Michel Forst condemned the UK\u2019s approach.\n\nActivists have also expressed concern about the inconsistency with which protest cases are being tried. The signatories to the new letter write that, if the solicitor general stands by his decision to prosecute Warner, then he should do the same to everyone who held similar signs.\n\nCourts was appointed solicitor general in December, replacing Michael Tomlinson. He welcomed the UK setting a net zero target in 2019 but has voted against numerous other measures to tackle climate breakdown and is now fighting the development of a large solar farm in his constituency.\n\nThe government has continued to try to restrict what protesters can say in court. The attorney general recently asked the court of appeal to review whether climate protesters can make the argument of \u201cconsent\u201d in court, a hearing on which is being held later this month.\n\nThis is understood to be a direct reference to a November trial in which a jury cleared nine women of criminal damage for breaking the windows of HSBC\u2019s headquarters in London. The judge allowed them to argue that they truly believed HSBC\u2019s shareholders would have agreed to their actions if they had known the scale of the climate crisis and the bank\u2019s contribution to it.\n\nSimilar arguments have been used by Palestine Action activists on trial for targeting Israel\u2019s largest private weapons company.\n\nThe latest move by the attorney general echoes a court of appeal ruling that restricted criminal damage defences after the acquittal of four people who toppled a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol."}

It was his first role in F1 having previously founded and then run the Formula 3000 Arden team.\n\nWhen Red Bull brought him in to take over Jaguar had been struggling in the midfield at the time but Horner has since managed a remarkable success story and expansion of the team to one of the largest in F1 that now also manufactures its own engines.\n\nHe was instrumental in bringing the designer Adrian Newey to Red Bull in 2006. They took their first win in 2009 and their first title in 2010 with Sebastian Vettel only five years after Horner had taken over. The German driver went on to secure three more consecutive championships.\n\nIn 2021 Max Verstappen returned their fifth drivers\u2019 title and they have enjoyed a run of unprecedented dominance since then. They won 21 of 22 races last season, with Verstappen taking a record 10 consecutive wins before securing their sixth drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championship double.\n\nThey are expected to be hard to beat this season and will launch their new car the RB20 on 15 February at their headquarters in Milton Keynes. The first race takes place in Bahrain on 2 March."}

A former pupil of Malsis preparatory school, in north Yorkshire, where students were abused over three decades by teachers David Hope and Peter Holmes, said mandatory reporting was urgently needed.\n\nAccording to a court of appeal judgment, the head of Malsis told staff that any parental concerns should be directed to him and spoke to Holmes about his conduct without prompting any change in his behaviour.\n\nThe former pupil said: \u201cThe majority of people would have killed themselves by now just because of the things that he did [to me] and how I\u2019ve been just left to fend for myself. The fact that one man knew all this and could have stopped it and yet my parents paid for the privilege of that, it makes my blood boil.\n\n\u201cThe fact that any delay [to mandatory reporting] is potentially causing enormous amounts of crap in someone\u2019s life, it\u2019s just abhorrent. It should have been done years ago.\u201d\n\nA consultation on mandatory reporting was announced by the government in 2014, the same year IICSA was announced, and the following year the then prime minister, David Cameron, set out proposals, never enacted, to jail people in positions of responsibility for up to five years if they turned a blind eye to child abuse.\n\nNow that the government has moved quickly to fix the injustice suffered by post office operators wrongfully convicted as a result of the Horizon IT system, after an ITV drama about it, ministers are facing pressure to act faster on the recommendations of other inquiries, including Windrush, the contaminated blood scandal and now IICSA.\n\nThe former Malsis pupil said people were uncomfortable talking about sexual abuse, whereas \u201cyou can have a cup of tea and read [a newspaper] whilst reading that story [about the Post Office]\u201d.\n\nOut of the 20 recommendations of IICSA, the only other one the government has committed to is a redress scheme for survivors of child sex abuse, but that too has yet to be implemented.\n\nJonathan West, director of the Mandate Now pressure group, said it was \u201cincredibly frustrating\u201d that mandatory reporting had not been introduced \u201cas if the public inquiry wasn\u2019t sufficient consultation by itself\u201d. He also said the government proposal \u201cbears no resemblance to the [IICSA] recommendation\u201d as it suggests that those who fail to report will be referred to the Disclosure and Barring Service and/or be subject to sanctions by their professional regulator rather than face criminal liability.\n\n\u201cWe have mandatory reporting for money laundering,\u201d said West. \u201cWe protect our money more than we protect our children. It seems an odd sense of priorities.\u201d\n\nLeigh Day partner Dino Nocivelli, who has represented hundreds of child sexual abuse survivors, including Malsis pupils, said: \u201cAfter listening to many abuse survivors and spending nearly \u00a3200m on IICSA, which published their final report in October 2022, it is wrong that mandatory reporting has still not been introduced.\n\n\u201cWe need to break the silence of abuse, help survivors and protect children where we can, and mandatory reporting is an important tool to achieve these aims.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing our consultation on mandatory reporting, which closed on 30 November, we outlined that we intend to introduce a new legal requirement for those in roles with responsibility for children to report child sexual abuse in the criminal justice bill.\n\n\u201cWe have invested significantly in the police response to child sexual abuse, with a 20% increase in charges in the last year.\u201d"}

The CSI 300 index, which tracks the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses, tumbled nearly 5% last week to a a five-year low. On Sunday, the Chinese securities regulatory commission said it would step up market stabilisation measures.\n\nThe popularity of the US embassy\u2019s post about giraffes prompted giraffe-related comments elsewhere on Weibo. In one since deleted comment, a user wrote: \u201cThe giraffe has reached a new high. Even though many comments have been deleted and many likes have been deleted, it has still reached a new high!

I wanted to celebrate a different kind of beautiful, a kind of body other than what you normally see in art. I approached the British Paralympic Association and through them contacted Peter Hull [the British swimmer and Paralympic gold medallist] and made a sculpture of him. Pete was a friend of Alison Lapper and he put me in touch with her. By the time she agreed for me to sculpt her, Alison was pregnant with her late son Parys. I thought: \u201cWonderful! Pregnancy is about the future!\u201d I thought the sculpture could be a monument to the future, when a great deal of sculpture is a monument to the past.\n\nAlison came to my studio and we made a cast of her which gave the basic form. We took measurements and photos \u2013 we were creating a kind of 3D sketch. But the point of the sitting was to get a sense of how she sits and her spirit. It took about four hours, which was very demanding on her. I can\u2019t remember if there was music playing, but I do remember we were chatting the whole time.\n\nBetween the initial sitting and the final sculpture there was a lot of work, sourcing the marble in Carrara, Italy, and so on. So much so that by the time Alison came to see the final sculpture, Parys was three, I think. It was exhibited at the White Cube in London and a gallery in Germany and was well-received.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018We got a lot of flak, to put it mildly\u2019 \u2026 Marc Quinn with his artwork being put into position in Trafalgar Square. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\nThen all hell broke loose when we applied to have the sculpture on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. Alison Lapper Pregnant was unveiled on 15 September 2005. It was 13 tons and 3.5 metres high. We got a lot of flak, to put it mildly, from it being called \u201cpatronising\u201d to \u201cghastly\u201d. But I think it was, and remains, incredibly subversive. Every other statue in that part of London is of a dead bloke who conquered the world. And here, instead, was a living woman looking to the future and kicking arse.\n\nIt was up there for two years, a year longer than usual since the next sculptor hadn\u2019t finished their piece on time. Since then, it has been looking for a home. Every organisation we approached in New York, because a lot of public squares in the city are privately owned, said no. They didn\u2019t want to be associated with something so controversial. We\u2019re looking for the right place to put it permanently. This artwork needs to live in public.\n\nThe idea was to be part of the world and part of how people think in the time you live in. That\u2019s all you can do, isn\u2019t it? If Alison and I changed the world a little, that\u2019s great. In 500 years, people will be looking at this sculpture and they will know it was of Alison but not who made it. Alison is immortal in that sense \u2013 what she represents will live beyond both of us.\n\nAlison Lapper, artist and model\n\nView image in fullscreen Alison Lapper with her son, Parys, at the unveiling of the sculpture. Photograph: Dan Chung/The Guardian\n\nIn the beginning, I didn\u2019t understand what Marc was trying to do, so I said no. Then a year later he called and I told him I was pregnant \u2013 it was almost as if he dived down the phone. One of the reasons we are probably still friends and working together is because I realised that to have a sculpture made of me while pregnant, that will exist longer than I\u2019m going to be here, is great. It\u2019s going to outlive me and it has already outlived my son, Parys.\n\nI sat on the table in Marc\u2019s studio for four hours. He literally had to hold me up towards the end because I was so tired \u2013 I\u2019m not good at sitting without support. For me, it was about capturing that moment in time when I was pregnant, knowing that I would probably never be pregnant again. It wasn\u2019t awkward to chat to Marc while I was naked. I\u2019m very comfortable in my own skin.\n\nWhen it was first announced that the sculpture was going on the fourth plinth, I was slated. The Sun wrote about \u201cTravulgar Square\u201d. It was awful. People are less obviously rude today but the same judgments are there. I\u2019m making a documentary at the moment using archive footage of when I was a child, and the so-called professionals talked about us as \u201climbless babies\u201d, as if we were broken and not complete. Most people think all disabled people are a drain and burden on society. People think I am completely useless. But I can do anything or go anywhere. I open my mouth and they fall over. When they find out that I drive a car, I work, I\u2019ve got a mortgage and had a child, it blows their minds.\n\nThis sculpture gave me a voice for the first time and maybe it did the same for others who have different bodies. I was up there, a pregnant, naked, disabled single mother. Marc couldn\u2019t really have picked any better.\n\nI look at the sculpture and it makes me smile, because I was told I could never have a child. People were writing to the papers going: \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting that people like that should be allowed to get pregnant.\u201d Excuse me?\n\nParys died four years ago from mental health and drug problems, which, despite what they say, go hand in hand. How can you explain what it\u2019s like to lose a child? He was the most precious human to me in the whole world. I would have given up anything for him, done anything for him. I took photographs of my dear son and used them as the basis for paintings and portraits of him when he was very ill and when he died. I painted his portrait, with me kissing his forehead, to go into the exhibition that Marc and his team have helped me organise. It tore me apart, because I had to stare at this scene for weeks and weeks on end.\n\nIf you want to challenge me, bring it on, because all I\u2019m doing is trying to portray the feeling of grief and loss in a way that many people, for whatever reasons, don\u2019t understand. In the same way that the sculpture of me was looked at as horrific in the beginning, some might find it horrific that my dead son is on these canvases. So criticise if you like, but I\u2019ve been brave enough to go, \u201cRight, this is the most painful thing to do. But I\u2019m going to follow through and do it.\u201d And I have."}
